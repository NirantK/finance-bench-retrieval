Item 1. Business

PART I

The Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”),  is one of the world’s major
aerospace firms.

We are organized based on the products and services we offer. We operate in four reportable segments:

•

•

Commercial Airplanes (BCA);

Defense, Space & Security (BDS);

• Global Services (BGS);

•

Boeing Capital (BCC).

Commercial Airplanes Segment

This  segment  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  and  provides  fleet  support  services,  principally  to  the  commercial  airline
industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum
of global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and
the 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models. Development continues on the 777X program and certain 737 MAX derivatives.

Defense, Space & Security Segment

This segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems
for  strike,  surveillance  and  mobility,  including  fighter  and  trainer  aircraft;  vertical  lift,  including  rotorcraft  and  tilt-rotor  aircraft;  and  commercial
derivative  aircraft,  including  anti-submarine  and  tanker  aircraft.  In  addition,  this  segment  engages  in  the  research,  development,  production  and
modification  of  the  following  products  and  related  services:  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  including  strategic  missile  and  defense
systems,  command,  control,  communications,  computers,  intelligence, surveillance  and reconnaissance  (C4ISR),  cyber and information  solutions,
and intelligence systems, satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and space exploration.

BDS'  primary  customer  is  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  (U.S.  DoD).  Revenues  from  the  U.S.  DoD,  including  foreign  military  sales
through  the  U.S.  government,  accounted  for  approximately  84%  of  its  2021  revenues.  Other  significant  BDS  customers  include  the  National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.

This segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A
Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. This segment produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.
Unmanned  vehicles  include  the  MQ-25,  QF-16  and  Insitu’s  Scan  Eagle  aircraft.  In  addition,  this  segment's  products  include  space  and  missile
systems including: government and commercial satellites, NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS), the International Space Station, Commercial Crew,
missile defense and weapons programs and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance joint venture.

Global Services Segment

This segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers  worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace platforms and systems with a full
spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and
conversions,  spare  parts,  pilot  and  maintenance  training  systems  and  services,  technical  and  maintenance  documents,  and  data  analytics  and
digital services.

Boeing Capital Segment

BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product, while managing overall
financing  exposure.  BCC’s portfolio  consists  of equipment  under operating  leases,  sales-type/finance  leases,  notes  and other  receivables,  assets
held for sale or re-lease and investments.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition
to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government
has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance  of government contracts,  and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions
covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade
secrets  and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  the
aggregate  are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  the
expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.

Human Capital

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and
safety  of  our  employees  and  maintain  business  continuity.  As  COVID-19  vaccines  became  available,  we  strongly  encouraged  employees  to  get
vaccinated when eligible, followed federal and state government vaccination requirements, provided resources and support to help employees get
vaccinated, offered paid time off for primary and booster vaccinations, and supported vaccination clinics for our employees and their families. We
provided  access  to  virtual  primary  care  physicians  at  no  cost.  We  expanded  our  virtual  work  options  and  many  of  our  office  workers  continue  to
telecommute.  We have maintained safety  protocols  at our sites,  including face  coverings,  physical  distance requirements  and enhanced cleaning
requirements. We continue to encourage daily self-health checks and operate our coronavirus hotline, which enables employees to report exposure
to COVID-19 and positive COVID-19 test results directly to our Health Services group. As part of that reporting process, we have a robust contact
tracing program to identify those who have been in close contact in the workplace with employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. All of the
actions  above  are  overseen  by  Boeing’s  Crisis  Management  Working  Group,  a  multi-functional,  multi-discipline  team  tasked  with  integrating  all
aspects of Boeing’s COVID-19 response.

As of December 31, 2021, Boeing’s total workforce was approximately 142,000, with 12% located outside of the U.S.

Status of the Agreements with Major Union

We have two major agreements; one expiring in July 2022 and
one in September 2024.
We have two major agreements expiring in October 2026.

We have one major agreement expiring in October 2022.

We aspire to be the most equitable, diverse and inclusive company. Guided by our values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone
is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We are committed to diverse representation across all
levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work. In June of 2021, we released our
first  Global  Equity,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  report  with  our  workforce  composition.  As  of  December  2020,  our  U.S.  workforce  was  comprised  of
approximately 23% women, 31% racial and ethnic minorities and 15% veterans. We also support Business Resource Groups open to all employees
with  more  than  13,000  participants  across  150  chapters  globally  that  focus  on  gender,  race  &  ethnicity,  generations,  gender  identity,  sexual
orientation,  disability  or  veteran  status.  These  groups  help  foster  inclusion  among  all  teammates,  build  awareness,  recruit  and  retain  a  diverse
workforce  and  support  the  company  in  successfully  operating  in  a  global,  multicultural  business  environment.  We  are  committed  to  releasing  a
Global Equity, Diversity and Inclusion report in 2022 which will be updated with 2021 information. Our 2021 report can be found on our website.

To attract and retain the best-qualified talent, we offer competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, paid time off,
parental  leave,  retirement  benefits,  tuition  assistance,  employee  skills  development,  leadership  development  and  rotation  programs.  In  2021,  our
voluntary resignation rate was approximately 4%. Additionally, we hired approximately 9,800 new employees in 2021 for critical skills and had an
offer acceptance rate of 83%.

Employees are encouraged to provide feedback about their experience through ongoing employee engagement activities. Boeing actively listens to
its employees via surveys ranging from pre-hire to exiting the company. These voluntary surveys provide aggregate trend reports for the company to
address in real time and ensure Boeing maintains an employee-focused experience and culture. We also invest in rewarding performance and have
established a multi-level recognition program for the purpose of acknowledging the achievements of excellent individual or team performance.

We are committed to supporting our employees’ continuous development of professional,  technical and leadership skills through access to digital
learning  resources  and  through  partnerships  with  leading  professional/technical  societies  and  organizations  around  the  world.  For  2021,  Boeing
employees  consumed  approximately  3.6  million  hours  of  learning.  We  offer  the  ability  for  our  people  to  pursue  degree  programs,  professional
certificates and individual courses in strategic fields of study from more than 300 accredited colleges and universities, online and across the globe
through our tuition assistance program. Over 10,000 Boeing employees leverage these programs every year.

Table of Contents

Safety, quality, integrity and sustainability are at the core of how Boeing operates. We aspire to achieve zero workplace injuries and provide a safe,
open  and  accountable  work  environment  for  our  employees.  We  provide  several  channels  for  all  employees  to  speak  up,  ask  for  guidance  and
report concerns related to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.

Competition

The  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  are
intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  are  focused  on  improving  our
processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with
higher quality products.

BDS  faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  Raytheon
Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to
build  a  strategic  presence  in  the  U.S.  market  by  strengthening  their  North  American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In
addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the
trend of strong competition to continue into 2022.

The  commercial  and  defense  services  markets  are  extremely  challenging  and  are  made  up  of  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products
and  services  which  span  the  life  cycle  of  our  defense  and  commercial  airplane  programs:  training,  fleet  services  and  logistics,  maintenance  and
engineering, modifications and upgrades, as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive
in 2022, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.

Regulatory Matters

Our  businesses  are  heavily  regulated  in  most  of  our  markets.  We  work  with  numerous  U.S.  government  agencies  and  entities,  including  but  not
limited  to,  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.
Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.

Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well
as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for
convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our
government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  default,  generally  the  U.S.  government  would  pay  only  for  the  work  that  has  been  accepted  and
could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from
the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.

Commercial Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations  governing  production  and  quality
systems,  airworthiness  and  installation  approvals,  repair  procedures  and  continuing  operational  safety.  New  aircraft  models  and  new  derivative
aircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into service. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation
and operational approvals. These requirements are generally

4

Table of Contents

administered  by  the  national  aviation  authorities  of  each  country  and,  in  the  case  of  Europe,  coordinated  by  the  European  Union  Aviation  Safety
Agency.

Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the
discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  could  also  be  affected  by  future  laws  and
regulations  relating  to  climate  change,  including  laws  related  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  These  laws  and  regulations  could  lead  to  increased
environmental  compliance  expenditures,  increased  energy  and  raw  materials  costs  and  new  and/or  additional  investment  in  designs  and
technologies. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance
with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Investigation,  remediation  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  associated  with
environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our
contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  It  is  reasonably  possible  that  costs  incurred  to  ensure  continued  environmental  compliance  could  have  a
material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards
are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by
the results of investigations.

A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP
by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost
of remediating contamination at our facilities, former facilities or third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which
we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional
information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-U.S.  Sales. Our  non-U.S.  sales  are  subject  to  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  governmental  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and  practices,
including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S.
sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.

Raw Materials, Parts and Subassemblies

We  are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  most
important  raw materials  required for  our aerospace products  are aluminum (sheet,  plate, forgings and extrusions),  titanium  (sheet,  plate, forgings
and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of
the  sources  could  take  a  year  or  more.  Many  major  components  and  product  equipment  items  are  procured  or  subcontracted  on  a  sole-source
basis.

Suppliers

We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality
standards  and  delivery  schedules  at  our  anticipated  costs.  While  we  maintain  an  extensive  qualification  and  performance  surveillance  system  to
control  risk  associated  with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affect
production  schedules  and  program/contract  profitability,  thereby  jeopardizing  our  ability  to  fulfill  commitments  to  our  customers.  We  are  also
dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.

Forward-Looking Statements

This report, as well as our annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports and other filings we make with the SEC, press and earnings releases and
other  written  and  oral  communications,  contain  “forward-looking  statements”  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of
1995. Words such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “projects,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “targets,” “anticipates” and similar expressions
generally  identify  these  forward-looking  statements.  Examples  of  forward-looking  statements  include  statements  relating  to  our  future  financial
condition and operating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.

Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to be
accurate.  These  statements  are  not  guarantees  and  are  subject  to  risks,  uncertainties  and  changes  in  circumstances  that  are  difficult  to  predict.
Many factors, including those set forth in the “Risk Factors” section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in
our  other  filings  with  the  SEC,  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  and  adversely  from  these  forward-looking  statements.  Any  forward-
looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Table of Contents

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially
from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information
contained in this report.

Risks Related to COVID-19

We face significant risks related to the spread of the COVID-19 virus and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had, and
will  continue  to  have,  significant  effects  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  We  also  face
significant risks related to the global economic downturn and severe reduction in commercial air traffic caused by the pandemic. These
risks include materially reduced demand for our products and services, increased instability in our operations and in our supply chain
and  challenges  to  the  ongoing  viability  of  some  of  our  customers.  In  addition,  future  vaccination  mandates  or  other  government
requirements may further disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. We may face similar risks in connection with
any future public health crises, including resurgences in the spread of COVID-19.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  subjected  our  business,  operations,  financial  performance,  cash  flows  and  financial  condition  to  a  number  of  risks,
including, but not limited to those discussed below.

Operations-related  risks: As  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  are  facing  increased  operational  challenges  from  the  need  to  protect
employee health and safety. These challenges have included, and may in the future include, production site shutdowns, workplace disruptions and
restrictions  on  the  movement  of  people,  social  distancing  guidelines,  increased  employee  absenteeism  due  to  illness  and/or  quarantine/contact
tracing requirements, as well as reduced availability of raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and those of our customers and suppliers.

During the second quarter of 2020, we temporarily suspended operations in Puget Sound, South Carolina, and Philadelphia, as well as at several
other key production sites. We had not previously experienced a complete suspension of our operations at these production sites. While we have
resumed operations at all of our production sites, we cannot predict whether or where further production disruptions could be required or what the
ongoing  impact  of  COVID-19-related  operating  restrictions  will  be.  For  example,  we  continue  to  experience  near-term  production  disruptions  and
inefficiencies  as  well  as  additional  operating  costs  due  to  social  distancing  requirements,  increased  levels  of  employee  absenteeism  and  other
factors  related  to  COVID-19  restrictions.  We  cannot  predict  the  impact  that  future  production  disruptions  may  have  on  our  business,  operations,
financial performance and financial condition. We continue to monitor federal, state and municipal health authorities for new or modified guidance
and  requirements  concerning  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  we  may  be  required  to  impose  additional  operational  restrictions  and/or  suspend
operations at key production sites based on these requirements and recommendations and/or workplace disruptions caused by COVID-19. If future
vaccination mandates or other similar governmental requirements take effect, or if COVID-19 case rates worsen at one or more of our production
facilities, we may face further increases in employee absenteeism and/or attrition, any of which could cause operational disruptions and otherwise
have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Many of our suppliers also were required to suspend operations during the second quarter of 2020. In 2021, we experienced part shortages which
disrupted  our  operations  and  delayed  deliveries.  We  may  experience  additional  disruptions  and/or  part  shortages  in  2022.  Any  such  disruptions
could have severe adverse impacts on our production costs, delivery schedule and/or ability to meet customer commitments.

7

Table of Contents

Further production disruptions and inefficiencies, suspension of operations or delayed recovery in our operations, and/or any comparable impacts
involving one or more of our key suppliers, or the failure of any of our key suppliers, would result in further challenges to our business, which could
have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

Liquidity  risks:  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  had  a  significant  impact  on  our  liquidity  and  overall  debt  levels.  During  the  year  ended
December 31, 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. At December 31, 2021, cash and short-term investments totaled $16.2
billion. Our debt balance totaled $58.1 billion at December 31, 2021, down from $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020. We expect negative operating
cash flows in future quarters until deliveries begin to return to historical levels, and if the pace and scope of the recovery are worse than we currently
contemplate,  we  may  need  to  obtain  additional  financing  in  order  to  fund  our  operations  and  obligations.  If  we  were  to  need  to  obtain  additional
financing,  uncertainty  related  to  COVID-19  and its  impact  on us and the  aerospace  industry,  as  well as continued  uncertainty  with  respect  to  our
credit rating could limit our access to credit markets and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition,
certain of our customers may also be unable to make timely payments to us. Factors that could limit our access to additional liquidity include further
disruptions in the global capital markets and/or additional declines in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or
all of these events could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and/or meet outstanding debt obligations and contractual commitments.
In addition, further downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and
access to capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse impact on our businesses.

Customer-related risks: Commercial air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend has impacted passenger traffic
most  severely.  Most  airlines  have  significantly  reduced  their  capacity,  and  many  could  implement  further  reductions.  Many  airlines  are  also
implementing significant reductions in staffing. These capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to our
customers’  revenue,  earnings,  and  cash  flow,  and  in  some  cases  may  threaten  the  future  viability  of  some  of  our  customers,  potentially  causing
defaults within our customer financing portfolio, which was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and/or requiring us to remarket aircraft that have
already been produced and/or are currently in backlog. If we are unable to successfully remarket these aircraft and/or the narrow-body and wide-
body  markets  do  not  recover  as  soon  as  we  are  currently  assuming,  or  if  we  are  required  to  further  reduce  production  rates  and/or  contract  the
accounting  quantity  on  any  of  our  commercial  programs,  we  could  experience  material  reductions  in  earnings  and/or  be  required  to  recognize  a
reach-forward loss on one or more of our programs. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized a reach-forward loss on the 777X
program in part due to impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we may experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations
across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand. Our customers may also
lack sufficient liquidity to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic.

In  addition  to  the  near-term  impact,  there  is  risk  that  the  industry  implements  longer-term  strategies  involving  reduced  capacity,  shifting  route
patterns and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experience
reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel as a result of travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements.

As a result, there is significant uncertainty with respect to whether and at what point commercial air traffic capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-
COVID-19 levels. This uncertainty may have a significant impact on the demand for both single-aisle and wide-body commercial aircraft, as well as
for the services we provide to commercial airlines. In addition, a lengthy period of reduced industry-wide demand for commercial aircraft would put
additional  pressure  on  our  suppliers,  resulting  in  increased  procurement  costs  and/or  additional  supply  chain  disruption.  To  the  extent  that  the
COVID-19 pandemic

8

Table of Contents

or its aftermath further impacts demand for our products and services or impairs the viability of some of our customers and/or suppliers, our financial
position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be adversely affected, and those impacts could be material.

Other  risks: The  magnitude  and  duration  of  the  global  COVID-19  pandemic  is  uncertain  and  continues  to  adversely  affect  our  business  and
operating and financial results. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2020, due in part to the prolonged adverse impact of the pandemic on our
earnings,  we  recorded  an  increase  of  $2.5  billion  to  the  valuation  allowance  associated  with  deferred  income  tax  assets.  The  pandemic  also  is
expected  to  heighten  many  of  the  other  risks  described  below.  For  example,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  could  cause  and  continue  to  cause  an
increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base. Further, the COVID-
19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to
present significant risks to our operations or financial results.

Risks Related to Our Business and Operations

We remain subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the 737 MAX. These risks include uncertainties regarding the timing
and  conditions  of  remaining  737  MAX  regulatory  approvals,  lower  than  planned  production  rates  and/or  delivery  rates,  additional
considerations to customers, increased supplier costs and supply chain health, changes to the assumptions and estimates made in our
financial  statements  regarding  the  737  program  and  potential  outcomes  of  737  MAX-related  legal  proceedings  and  government
investigations that remain outstanding.

On March 13, 2019, the FAA issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two
fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737 MAX were suspended until
December 2020. The grounding reduced revenues, operating margins and cash flows, and will continue to do so until production rates return to pre-
grounding levels. While we have received regulatory approval to return the 737 MAX to service in most jurisdictions, we continue to work with certain
non-U.S. civil aviation authorities to complete remaining steps toward certification and readiness for return to service worldwide. Any delays in the
completion of the certification activities and/or the ramp-up of deliveries or other liabilities associated with the accidents or grounding could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against us
related to the 737 MAX. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including an
ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also remain subject to compliance with a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
with the U.S. Department of Justice relating to the Department of Justice’s investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by
the FAA. We expensed $744 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. Any further adverse impacts related to any such litigation
or investigations could have a further material impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

During 2019, we announced plans to reduce, and ultimately to suspend 737 production. Impacts related to our suspension of 737 MAX production
from  2019  to  2020  significantly  increased  costs  to  produce  aircraft  included  in  the  current  accounting  quantity  and  have  resulted  in  reduced  737
program  and  overall  BCA  segment  operating  margins.  We  have  also  made  significant  assumptions  regarding  estimated  costs  expected  to  be
incurred  in  2022  that  should  be  included  in  program  inventory  and  those  estimated  costs  that  will  be  expensed  when  incurred  as  abnormal
production costs. If the completion of remaining certification activities and/or our ability to deliver 737 aircraft to customers is impaired, we will incur
significant  additional  costs  and/or  be  required  to  delay  the  planned  ramp-up  of  737  production.  These  delays  would  also  result  in  significant
additional disruption to the 737 production system and

9

Table of Contents

further  delay  efforts  to  restore  and/or  implement  previously  planned  increases  in  the  737  production  rate.  Cash  flows  continue  to  be  negatively
impacted by delayed payments from customers, higher costs and inventory levels, and payments made to customers in connection with disruption to
their operations. In addition, we have experienced claims and assertions from customers in connection with the grounding and associated delivery
delays, and recorded an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for these disruptions. As of December 31, 2021,
the  remaining  liability  associated  with  these  concessions  and  other  considerations  totaled  $2.9  billion,  of  which  $0.7  billion  remains  subject  to
negotiation.

Any further delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX in one or more jurisdictions, further disruptions to suppliers and/or the long-term health of
the  production  system,  supplier  claims  or  assertions,  or  changes  to  estimated  concessions  or  other  considerations  we  expect  to  provide  to
customers  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations  and/or  cash  flows.  In  the  event  of  unanticipated
additional training requirements in one or more jurisdictions, delays in regulatory approval and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries to one or
more  customers,  we  may  be  required  to  take  actions  with  longer-term  impact,  such  as  further  changes  to  our  production  plans,  employment
reductions and/or the expenditure of significant resources to support our supply chain and/or customers.

We have made significant estimates with respect to the 737 program regarding the number of units to be produced, the period during which those
units are likely to be produced, and the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine
warranty  costs.  We  have  made  assumptions  regarding  outcomes  of  accident  investigations  and  other  government  inquiries,  timing  of  future  737
production rate increases, timing and sequence of future deliveries, supply chain health as we implement our production plans, as well as outcomes
of negotiations with customers. Any changes in these estimates and/or assumptions with respect to the 737 program could have a material impact
on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

In  addition  to  the  impact  of  COVID-19  described  above,  our  Commercial  Airplanes  and  Global  Services  businesses  depend  heavily  on
commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.

Market  conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The  commercial  aircraft  market  is
predominantly  driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  are
sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced
by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and
other  competitive  factors,  fuel  prices,  terrorism,  epidemics  and  environmental  regulations.  Traditionally,  the  airline  industry  has  been  cyclical  and
very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the
global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new
orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result
in  lower  revenues,  profitability  and  cash  flows  and  a  reduction  in  our  contractual  backlog.  In  addition,  because  our  commercial  aircraft  backlog
consists  of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these  macroeconomic,  industry  or  customer  impacts  could
unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.

We  enter  into  firm  fixed-price  aircraft  sales  contracts  with  indexed  price  escalation  clauses,  which  could  subject  us  to  losses  if  we  have  cost
overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before
the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally
consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas

10

Table of Contents

derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation
formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in
escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from  a limited number of commercial  airlines. We can make no assurance  that any customer  will
exercise  purchase  options,  fulfill  existing  purchase  commitments  or  purchase  additional  products  or  services  from  us.  In  addition,  fleet  decisions,
airline  consolidations  or  financial  challenges  involving  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could significantly  reduce  our  revenues  and
limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.

Our  Commercial  Airplanes  business  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  a  healthy  production  system,  ensure  every  airplane  in  our
production system conforms to our exacting specification, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or
new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.

The  commercial  aircraft  business  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  with  U.S  and  non-U.S.  suppliers,  highly-
skilled  labor  from  thousands  of  employees  and  other  partners,  and  stringent  regulatory  requirements,  including  the  risk  of  evolving  standards  for
commercial  aircraft  certification,  and  performance  and  reliability  standards.  The  FAA  has  been  working  to  implement  safety  reforms  such  as  the
implementation of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing the
process for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. To
the  extent  the  FAA  or  other  similar  regulatory  agencies  outside  the  U.S.  implement  more  stringent  regulations,  we  may  incur  additional  costs  to
achieve compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated
with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding
of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation authorities around the globe. 737 MAX
deliveries resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, we
experienced  production  quality  issues,  including  in  our  supply  chain,  which  have  contributed  to  lower  787  deliveries,  including  a  pause  in  787
deliveries  since  May  2021.  During  2021,  this  resulted  in  reprioritizing  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework.  We  continue  to
conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming
delivery. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individual
airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. The regulators will ultimately determine the timing
and  conditions  for  resuming  787  deliveries.  Delays  on  the  737  MAX,  777X  and  787  programs  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,
customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.

We must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet
customer  demand  and  maintain  our  profitability.  We  have  previously  announced  plans  to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial
aircraft  programs.  During  2021,  we  reprioritized  production  resources  to  support  inspections  and  rework  on  undelivered  787  aircraft.  The  787
program is currently producing at very low rates and expects that to continue until deliveries resume. We are also continuing to implement changes
in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. In
addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs,
identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate changes at any

11

Table of Contents

of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely
deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial
performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.

Operational  challenges  impacting  the  production  system  for  one  or  more  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs  could  result  in  production  delays
and/or  failure  to  meet  customer  demand  for  new  aircraft,  either  of  which  would  negatively  impact  our  revenues  and  operating  margins.  Our
commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet
internal  performance  plans,  or  delays  or  failures  to  achieve  required  regulatory  approval,  could  result  in  significant  out-of-sequence  work  and
increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support
costs. For example, in 2021, we performed additional inspections and associated rework on 787 aircraft in inventory and continued discussions with
the FAA regarding required actions to resume deliveries, resulting in additional costs and further delays in aircraft deliveries to customers.

If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing
and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory
agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any
Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.

Changes  in  levels  of  U.S.  government  defense  spending  or  overall  acquisition  priorities  could  negatively  impact  our  financial  position
and results of operations.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD. Levels of U.S.
defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the evolving nature of the national security threat
environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political environment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the
U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills.

The timeliness of FY22 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations for
government  departments  or  agencies  would  result  in  a  full  or  partial  government  shutdown,  which  could  impact  the  Company’s  operations.
Alternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict the
execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall
levels  of  defense  spending  in  FY22  and  beyond,  and  it  is  likely  that  U.S.  government  discretionary  spending,  including  defense  spending,  will
continue to be subject to pressure.

There  continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  future  acquisition  priorities  and  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  DoD  and  other
government  agencies  (including  NASA),  including  changes  to  national  security  and  defense  priorities,  and  tension  between  modernization
investments, sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or budget
cuts,  including  changes  associated  with  the  authorizations  and  appropriations  process,  could  result  in  reductions,  cancellations,  and/or  delays  of
existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s
financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

In  addition,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  and  the  evolving  nature  of  the  national
security threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innovation, cybersecurity and delivery of technical
data and

12

Table of Contents

software  in  its  procurement  processes.  If  we  can  no  longer  adjust  successfully  to  these  changing  acquisition  policies,  our  revenues  and  market
share could be impacted. Also, additional federal appropriations to cover the increased costs of federal contractors’ compliance with evolving U.S.
Government contractual requirements associated with COVID-19 mitigation are unlikely, reducing the U.S. Government’s buying power.

Our  ability  to  deliver  products  and  services  that  satisfy  customer  requirements  is  heavily  dependent  on  the  performance  and  financial
stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components.

We  rely  on  other  companies,  including  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  subcontractors  and  suppliers,  to  provide  and  produce  raw  materials,  integrated
components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more
of  our  suppliers  or  subcontractors  experiences  financial  difficulties,  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meet
commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum,
titanium or composites) becomes unavailable to us or our suppliers, or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more
of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from
one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geopolitical developments, or as a result of performance
problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating
costs.

Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales.

The  markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specialized
engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing
competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry
consolidation,  shifting  acquisition  and  budget  priorities,  and  continued  cost  pressure  at  our  U.S.  DoD  and  non-U.S.  customers  will  intensify
competition  for  many  of  our  BDS  products.  Our  BGS  segment  faces  competition  from  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  competitors
facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not
result in reduced revenues and market share.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.

In 2021, non-U.S. customers, which includes foreign military sales (FMS), accounted for approximately 37% of our revenues. We expect that non-
U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing
business internationally, including:

•

•

changes in regulatory requirements or other executive branch actions, such as Executive Orders;

changes in the global trade environment, including disputes with authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including international trade authorities,
that could impact sales and/or delivery of products and services outside the U.S. and/or impose costs on our customers in the form of tariffs,
duties or penalties attributable to the importation of Boeing products and services;

13

•

U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  policies,  including  requirements  to  expend  a  portion  of  program  funds  locally  and  governmental  industrial
cooperation or participation requirements;

fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;

volatility  in  international  political  and  economic  environments  and  changes  in  non-U.S.  national  priorities  and  budgets,  which  can  lead  to
delays or fluctuations in orders;

the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;

the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank
of the United States;

uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;

imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;

the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;

compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and

unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.

While  the  impact  of  these  factors  is  difficult  to  predict,  any  one  or  more  of  these  factors  could  adversely  affect  our  operations  in  the  future.  For
example, since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports. China is a very significant market for commercial airplanes
and represents a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. Impacts from these or future potential tariffs, or deterioration in trade
relations between the U.S. and one or more other countries, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations
and/or cash flows.

We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial
results.

Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule
and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is
complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because
costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to
performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess
anticipated performance. Supplier claims and assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of future
award fees are also included in sales and profit rates.

With  respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-
recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A
program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for
delivery  under  existing  and  anticipated  contracts  limited  by  the  ability  to  make  reasonably  dependable  estimates.  To  establish  the  relationship  of
sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over
which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other
non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of
intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix,

14

Table of Contents

production  costs  and  rates,  learning  curve,  changes  to  price  escalation  indices,  costs  of  derivative  aircraft,  supplier  performance,  customer  and
supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. In addition, on development programs such
as the 777X, we are subject to risks with respect to the timing and conditions of aircraft certification, including potential gaps between when aircraft
are certified in various jurisdictions, changes in certification processes and our estimates with respect to timing of future certifications, which could
have  an  impact  on  overall  program  status.  Any  such  change  in  estimates  relating  to  program  accounting  may  adversely  affect  future  financial
performance.

Because  of  the  significance  of  the  judgments  and  estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and  profit  amounts  could  be
recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or
estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and
profits,  see  our  discussion  under  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  –  Critical  Accounting  Policies  &  Estimates  –  Accounting  for  Long-term
Contracts/Program Accounting” on pages 51 – 54 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 64 – 77 of this Form 10-K.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.

As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize
the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired
business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the
acquired  operations.  Accordingly,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely  affected  by  unanticipated  performance  issues,  legacy  liabilities,
transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner
performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While
we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these
transactions  will  be  successful.  We  also  may  make  strategic  divestitures  from  time  to  time.  These  transactions  may  result  in  continued  financial
involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by
those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.

Risks Related to Our Contracts

We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.

In  2021,  49%  of  our  revenues  were  earned  pursuant  to  U.S.  government  contracts,  which  include  FMS  through  the  U.S.  government.  Business
conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.

Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New
procurement  regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  the
operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also result in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we
fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for our U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our
business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial
position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or
terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition,
funding  pursuant  to  our  U.S.  government  contracts  may  be  reduced  or  withheld  as  part  of  the  U.S.  Congressional  appropriations  process  due  to
fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs
could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions”
rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment or termination of
one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.
government contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit  Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,
routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable
laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to
be  misclassified  or  inaccurately  allocated  to  a  specific  contract  will  be  deemed  non-reimbursable,  and  to  the  extent  already  reimbursed,  must  be
refunded.  Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.
Furthermore,  if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  and
administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from
doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such
allegations are later determined to be false.

We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.

Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 68% and 69% of their 2021 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price
contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins
or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve  estimated  costs  and  revenues.  In  addition,  increased  compliance  costs  and  costs  due  to  loss  of
productivity due to COVID-19 may not be reimbursed. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which
can significantly affect our reported results. For example in the fourth quarter of 2021, BDS recorded additional losses of $402 million on the KC-46A
Tanker contract reflecting continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to
complete  the  new  Remote  Vision  System  as  the  customer’s  requirements  definition  has  evolved.  New  programs  could  also  have  risk  for  reach-
forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process
of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to
performance, which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions
relating to cost, schedule and performance.

Fixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  development
programs  have  highly  complex  designs.  In  addition,  technical  or  quality  issues  that  arise  during  development  could  lead  to  schedule  delays  and
higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS
fixed-price  development  contracts  include  Commercial  Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B  Presidential  Aircraft,  MQ-25,  and
commercial and military satellites.

Table of Contents

We enter into cost-type contracts, which also carry risks.

Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately  32% and 31% of their 2021 revenues from cost-type  contracting arrangements.
Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or
incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in
reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program  cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Programs  whose  contracts  are
primarily cost-type include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Proprietary and SLS programs.

We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.

Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments
may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is
at  risk  if  the  satellite  does  not  perform  to  specifications  for  up  to  15  years  after  acceptance.  The  net  present  value  of  in-orbit  incentive  fees  we
ultimately  expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,
customers  will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incur
significant charges.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Business Disruptions

Unauthorized access to our, our customers’ and/or our suppliers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.

We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive
network of technical security controls, policy enforcement  mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these
threats.  While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,
including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and
information technology systems for certain customers and/or suppliers. Many of these customers and/or suppliers face similar security threats. If we
cannot  prevent  the  unauthorized  access,  release  and/or  corruption  of  our  customers’  and/or  suppliers’  confidential,  classified  or  personally
identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.

Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.

Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology, or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging or
extreme weather (including effects of climate change), or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions
could  affect  our  internal  operations  or  our  suppliers’  operations  and  delay  delivery  of  products  and  services  to  our  customers.  Any  significant
production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of Boeing’s or our suppliers’ data, information systems or networks could impact
our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services.

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters

The  outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adverse
decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.

We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to
benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these
lawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive
regulation  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  its  various  states,  as  well  as  other  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  As  a  result,  we  are
sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S.
government,  the  heavily  regulated  nature  of  our  industry,  and in  the  case  of  environmental  proceedings,  our  current  or  past  ownership  of  certain
property.  Any  such  inquiry  or  investigation  could  potentially  result  in  an  adverse  ruling  against  us,  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our
financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.

We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge,
treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines
and  civil  or  criminal  sanctions,  as  well  as  third-party  claims  for  property  damage  or  personal  injury,  if  we  were  to  violate  or  become  liable  under
environmental  laws  or  regulations.  In  some  cases,  we  are  subject  to  such  costs  due  to  environmental  impacts  attributable  to  our  current  or  past
manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we are subject to such costs due to an indemnification
agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In all cases, our current liabilities and ongoing cost assessments
are based on current laws and regulations. New laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of
previously  unknown  contamination  or  the  imposition  of  new  remediation  requirements  could  result  in  additional  costs.  For  additional  information
relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.

Increasing stakeholder environmental, social and governance (ESG) expectations, physical and transition risks associated with climate change, and
emerging  ESG  regulation  and  policy  requirements  may  pose  risk  to  our  market  outlook,  brand  and  reputation,  financial  outlook,  cost  of  capital,
global supply chain and production continuity, which may impact our ability to achieve long-term business objectives. Changes in environmental and
climate change laws or regulations could lead to additional operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, require
new  or  additional  investment  in  product  designs,  result  in  carbon  offset  investments  or  otherwise  could  negatively  impact  our  business  and/or
competitive position. Increasing aircraft performance standards and requirements on manufacturing and product air pollutant emissions, especially
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, may result in increased costs or reputational risks and could limit our ability to manufacture and/or market certain
of our products at acceptable costs, or at all. Physical impacts of climate change, increasing global chemical restrictions and bans, and water and
waste requirements may drive increased costs to us and our suppliers and impact our production continuity and data facilities.

Finally, from time to time, in alignment with our sustainability priorities, we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments to improve our
environmental performance, such as our recent operational goals in areas of GHG emissions, energy, water and waste. If we fail to achieve or

18

Table of Contents

improperly  report  on  our  progress  toward  achieving  our  environmental  goals  and  commitments,  the  resulting  negative  publicity  could  adversely
affect our reputation and/or our access to capital.

Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity

We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable
terms or in sufficient amounts.

We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. In addition, our debt balances have increased
significantly since 2019, driven primarily by impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue to
actively manage our liquidity. Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2021, our debt
totaled  $58.1  billion  of  which  approximately  $11.4  billion  of  principal  payments  on  outstanding  debt  become  due  over  the  next  three  years.  In
addition,  as  of  December  31,  2021,  our  airplane  financing  commitments  totaled  $12.9  billion.  If  we  require  additional  funding  in  order  to  pay  off
existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to the 737 MAX, COVID-19, 787 production issues or broader market developments,
fund  outstanding  financing  commitments  or  meet  other  business  requirements,  our  market  liquidity  may  not  be  sufficient.  These  risks  will  be
particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to
have  greater  difficulty  accessing  public  and  private  markets  for  debt.  These  factors  include  disruptions  or  declines  in  the  global  capital  markets
and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, including impacts described above related to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or
associated changes in demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund
our operations and contractual or financing commitments.

Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash
flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.

Many of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts
required  under  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  and  discretionary  contributions  to  improve  the  plans'  funded  status.  The  extent  of
future  contributions  depends  heavily  on  market  factors  such  as  the  discount  rate  and  the  actual  return  on  plan  assets.  We  estimate  future
contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect
on future  contributions  as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result  in a significant  change to shareholders'  equity. For  U.S. government
contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We
also  provide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  and
qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level
of  medical  cost  increases.  For  a  discussion  regarding  how  our  financial  statements  can  be  affected  by  pension  and  other  postretirement  plan
accounting policies, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates - Pension Plans” on pages 54 - 55 of
this Form 10-K. Although under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) the timing of periodic pension
and other postretirement benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would
also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.

Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.

We  are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  some
circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S.

19

Table of Contents

government.  The  amount  of  our  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  claims  or  liabilities,  and  we  may  be  forced  to  bear  substantial  costs.  For
example,  liabilities  arising  from  the  use  of  certain  of  our  products,  such  as  aircraft  technologies,  space  systems,  spacecraft,  satellites,  missile
systems, weapons, cybersecurity, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable
on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the
2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance
coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.

A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft,
which exposes us to concentration risks.

A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is
also  concentrated  by  varying  degrees  across  Boeing  aircraft  product  types,  most  notably  717  and  747-8  aircraft,  and  among  customers  that  we
believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial
difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable
terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our financial position, results of
operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Risks Related to Labor

Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.

Approximately 47,000 employees, which constitute 33% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2021. We experienced a
work  stoppage  in  2008  when  a  labor  strike  halted  commercial  aircraft  and  certain  BDS  program  production.  We  may  experience  additional  work
stoppages  in  the  future,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business.  We  cannot  predict  how  stable  our  relationships,  currently  with  11  U.S.  labor
organizations  and  12  non-U.S.  labor  organizations,  will  be  or  whether  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the  unions’  requirements  without  impacting  our
financial  condition.  The  unions  may  also  limit  our  flexibility  in  dealing  with  our  workforce.  Union  actions  at  suppliers  can  also  affect  us.  Work
stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships
with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Overview

We are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites,
missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the
worldwide  commercial  airline  industry  and  one  of  the  largest  defense  contractors  in  the  U.S.  While  our  principal  operations  are  in  the  U.S.,  we
conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.

Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS) and
Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated
substantial  earnings  and  cash  flow  that  permit  us  to  invest  in  new  products  and services.  We  focus  on producing  the  products  and providing  the
services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA
is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, efficiency and value to
customers  around  the  world.  BDS  integrates  its  resources  in  defense,  intelligence,  communications,  security,  space  and  services  to  deliver
capability-driven  solutions  to  customers  at  reduced  costs.  Our  BDS  strategy  is  to  leverage  our  core  businesses  to  capture  key  next-generation
programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS
provides  support  for  commercial  and  defense  through  innovative,  comprehensive  and  cost-competitive  product  and  service  solutions.  BCC
facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.

Business Environment and Trends

The global outbreak of COVID-19, 787 production issues and associated rework, and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding continued to
have significant adverse impacts on our business in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel,
creating  a  tremendous  challenge  for  our  customers,  our  business  and  the  entire  commercial  aerospace  manufacturing  and  services  sector.  The
latest International Air Transport Association (IATA) release reported that passenger traffic in 2021 recovered to approximately 40% of 2019 levels,
as international markets saw continued reopening challenges. Additionally, global economic activity is improving, but continues to be impacted by
COVID-19, and governments continue to restrict travel to contain the spread of the virus. While recovery is accelerating, we continue to expect that
it will remain uneven as travel restrictions and varying regional travel protocols continue to impact air travel.

Generally, we continue to expect domestic travel to recover faster than international travel. As a result, we expect the narrow-body market to recover
faster  than  the  wide-body  market.  Also,  the  pace  of  the  commercial  market  recovery  will  be  heavily  dependent  on  COVID-19  infection  rates,
vaccination rates, and government travel and other restrictions on trade and commercial activity. Demand for dedicated freighters continues to be
strong, underpinned by a strong recovery  in global trade and overall air cargo growth. Overall cargo capacity remains challenged given the large
impact that COVID-19 has had on international passenger operations, which also carry cargo.

23

Table of Contents

Airline financial performance,  which also plays a role in the demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
According  to  IATA,  net  losses  for  the  airline  industry  were  $138  billion  in  2020  and  are  expected  to  be  approximately  $52  billion  in  2021.  Our
customers  are  taking  actions  to  combat  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  market  by  preserving  liquidity.  This  comes  in  many  forms,
such  as  deferrals  of  advances  and  other  payments  to  suppliers,  deferrals  of  deliveries,  reduced  spending  on  services  and,  in  some  cases,
cancellation  of  orders.  While  the  outlook  is  improving  and  we  have  seen  an  increase  in  new  orders  in  2021,  we  continue  to  face  a  challenging
environment  in the near- to medium-term  as airlines have adjusted  to reduced traffic,  which in turn has resulted in lower demand for commercial
aerospace products and services. The current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines.

We continue to expect commercial air travel to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We expect it will take a few years beyond that for the industry
to  return  to  long-term  trend  growth.  To  balance  the  supply  and  demand  given  the  COVID-19  shock  and  to  preserve  our  long-term  potential  and
competitiveness,  we  have  reduced  the  production  rates  of  several  of  our  BCA  programs.  These  rate  decisions  are  based  on  our  ongoing
assessments of the demand environment and availability of aircraft financing. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air
traffic  levels  will  recover,  and  whether,  and  at  what  point,  capacity  will  return  to  and/or  exceed  pre-COVID-19  levels.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of
2020, we made adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. We continue to anticipate that the first
777X  delivery  will  occur  in  late  2023.  We  will  closely  monitor  the  key  factors  that  affect  backlog  and  future  demand  for  each  of  our  commercial
aircraft programs, including customers’ evolving fleet plans, the wide-body replacement cycle and the cargo market. We will maintain a disciplined
rate management process and make adjustments as appropriate in the future. Notwithstanding the changes we have made to production rates, risk
remains that further reductions will be required. Additionally, if we are unable to make timely deliveries of the large number of aircraft in inventory as
of December 31, 2021, future revenues, earnings and cash flows will be adversely impacted.

Deliveries of the 737 MAX resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020, when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rescinded the order that grounded
737  MAX  aircraft  in the  U.S.  In  addition,  other  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities,  including  the  Brazilian  National  Civil  Aviation  Agency,  Transport
Canada  and  the  European  Union  Aviation  Safety  Agency  have  subsequently  approved  return  of  operations,  allowing  us  to  resume  deliveries  in
those jurisdictions. Over 185 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an
airworthiness directive in the fourth quarter of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to China
to  resume  in 2022,  subject  to final  regulatory  approvals,  although  risk  remains  around  the  timing  and rate  of  those  deliveries.  Orders  to  suspend
operations of 737 MAX aircraft from non-U.S. civil aviation authorities are still in effect in a small number of countries.

Deliveries and production have also been impacted by production issues and associated rework. For example, deliveries of the 787 are currently
paused and the production rate has been reduced while we focus on rework of undelivered aircraft and continue to engage in detailed discussions
with  the  FAA  regarding  required  actions  for  resuming  deliveries.  Risk  remains  that  these  issues  may  continue  to  impact  the  timing  of  airplane
deliveries in inventory and/or our ability to achieve planned production rates. Revenues, earnings and cash flows will continue to be impacted until
we are able to resume timely deliveries.

The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity
to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. The shock
from  COVID-19  has  reduced  the  near-  to  medium-term  demand,  but  our  Commercial  Market  Outlook  forecast  projects  a  4%  growth  rate  for
passenger and cargo traffic over a 20 year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.7% average annual gross domestic
product  (GDP)  growth,  we  project  demand  for  approximately  43,610  new  airplanes  over  the  next  20  years.  The  industry  remains  vulnerable  to
exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and
increased global environmental regulations.

A  Continuing  Resolution  (CR),  enacted  on  December  3,  2021,  continues  funding  for  the  federal  government  at  FY21  appropriated  levels  through
February  18,  2022.  Congress  and  the  President  must  enact  either  full-year  FY22  appropriations  bills  or  an  additional  CR  to  fund  government
departments and agencies beyond February 18, 2022 or a government shutdown could result, which may impact the Company’s operations.

At BGS, while the outlook is improving, we are continuing to see a direct impact on our commercial supply chain business as fewer flights and more
aircraft parked result in a decreased demand for our parts and logistics offerings. Additionally, our commercial customers are curtailing discretionary
spending, such as modifications and upgrades, and focusing on required maintenance. Similar to BCA, we expect a multi-year recovery period for
the  commercial  services  business.  The  demand  outlook  for  our  government  services  business  remains  stable;  government  services  comprises
approximately half of BGS revenue, which is unchanged from pre-pandemic levels.

At  BDS,  we  continue  to  see  a  healthy  market  with  solid  demand  for  our  major  platforms  and  programs  both  domestically  and  internationally.
However, while we continue to experience near-term production disruptions and inefficiencies due to COVID-19 impacts, we saw improvements in
2021.

In  addition,  we  are  experiencing  some  supply  chain  shortages.  Our  suppliers  are  also  experiencing  liquidity  pressures  and  disruptions  to  their
operations as a result of COVID-19. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These measures
and disruptions have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

We  continue  to  transform  and  improve  our  business  processes.  These  activities  are  not  intended  to  constrain  our  capacity  but  to  enable  the
Company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers. We expect that successful execution of these measures will improve
near-term liquidity and long-term cost competitiveness.

Revenues increased by $4,128 million in 2021 compared with 2020 driven by higher revenues at BCA, BDS and BGS. BCA revenues increased by
$3,331 million primarily driven by higher 737 MAX deliveries due to recertification and return to service in most jurisdictions and the absence of $498
million  of  737  MAX  customer  considerations  which  reduced  revenues  in  2020,  partially  offset  by  lower  787  deliveries  in  2021.  BDS  revenues
increased by $283 million primarily from higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program and lower charges in 2021. BGS revenues increased by
$785 million primarily due to higher commercial and government services volume.

Revenues decreased by $18,401 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower revenues in our commercial airplanes and commercial
services  businesses.  Revenues  for  each  of  our  segments  have  been  adversely  impacted  by  COVID-19.  BCA  revenues  decreased  by  $16,093
million due to lower deliveries driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 787 production issues and the 737 MAX grounding, offset by lower
charges  related  to  estimated  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  737  MAX  customers.  BDS  revenues  increased  by  $162  million
primarily due to higher fighter aircraft

26

Table of Contents

and  other  volume,  partially  offset  by  the  impact  of  higher  unfavorable  cumulative  contract  catch-up  adjustments,  largely  due  to  KC-46A  Tanker
charges  in  2020.  BGS  revenues  decreased  by  $2,925  million  primarily  due  to  lower  commercial  services  revenue  driven  by  the  COVID-19
pandemic. The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries,
as well as reserves related to cost accounting litigation recorded in 2019.

Revenues will continue to be significantly impacted until deliveries ramp up and the commercial airline industry recovers from the impacts of COVID-
19.

**    Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See pages 49 - 51.

Loss from operations decreased by $9,865 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower losses at BCA and higher earnings at BGS.
BCA loss from  operations  decreased  by $7,372  million  primarily  due to  the  absence of  a $6,493  million reach-forward  loss  on the 777X program
recorded  in  2020,  lower  period  expenses,  lower  737  MAX  customer  considerations  and  higher  737  MAX  deliveries,  partially  offset  by  a  $3,460
million  reach-forward  loss  on  the  787  program  in  2021.  BGS  earnings  from  operations  increased  by  $1,567  million  in  2021  compared  with  2020
primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher commercial services volume.

Loss from operations increased by $10,792 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to increased losses at BCA and decreased earnings at
BGS and BDS. BCA loss from operations increased by $7,190 million. The loss in 2020 primarily reflects a reach-forward loss recorded in the fourth
quarter of $6,493 million on the 777X program. BCA’s loss in 2020 also reflects the absence of MAX deliveries during the first three quarters of the
year,  lower  wide-body  deliveries  and  lower  program  margins  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  787  production  issues,  abnormal
production costs, 737NG frame fitting component repair costs, severance costs and 737 MAX customer considerations.

The  loss  in  2019  primarily  reflects  the  absence  of  737  MAX  deliveries  in  the  second,  third  and  fourth  quarters  and  charges  of  $8,259  million  for
estimated 737 MAX customer considerations. BDS earnings

27

Table of Contents

decreased by $1,076 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, including
charges of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B in 2020, partially offset by $489 million of charges on Commercial Crew in
2019. The lower earnings were also driven by lower gains on property sales compared to 2019. BGS earnings from operations decreased by $2,247
million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower commercial services revenue, as well as asset impairments and severance costs resulting
from the COVID-19 market environment.

Lower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins
until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.

Core operating loss decreased by $10,075 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower losses at BCA and higher earnings at BGS, as
described above.

Core operating loss increased by $10,760 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher losses at BCA and lower earnings at BGS and

Share-based plans expense increased by $54 million in 2021 and $55 million in 2020. The higher expense in 2021 was primarily related to a one-
time grant of restricted stock units (RSUs) to most employees in December 2020. The increase in 2020 was due to increased grants of RSUs and
other share-based compensation.

Deferred compensation expense increased by $33 million in 2021, primarily driven by changes in our stock price, and decreased by $81 million in
2020, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.

Research  and  development  expense  decreased  by  $56  million  in  2021  and  $161  million  in  2020  primarily  due  to  decreases  in  enterprise
investments in product development.

In 2019, we recorded a $250 million charge related to the impairment of lease incentives with one customer that experienced liquidity issues and a
$109 million charge related to ongoing litigation associated with recoverable costs on U.S. government contracts.

Eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $1,131 million in 2021 and increased by $822 million in 2020 primarily due to earnings
charges of $744 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 in anticipation of the agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice that was
finalized in January 2021 and higher income from operating investments in 2021. See Note 21.

The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in Loss from operations in 2021 decreased by $142 million compared with 2020 due to
reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in Loss from operations in 2020 was
largely consistent with 2019. Net periodic benefit cost included in Loss from operations in 2021 was largely consistent with 2020. The decrease in
net periodic benefit cost included in Loss from operations in 2020 was primarily due to prior year service cost that was included in earnings in 2019.

Non-operating pension income included in Other income, net was $528 million in 2021, $340 million in 2020 and $374 million in 2019. The increased
income  in  2021  compared  to  2020  was  primarily  due  to  lower  interest  cost  and  higher  expected  return  on  plan  assets,  partially  offset  by  higher
amortization  of  net  actuarial  losses  and  higher  settlement  charges.  The  decreased  income  in  2020  compared  to  2019  was  due  to  higher
amortization of actuarial losses and lower asset returns, partially offset by lower interest cost.

Non-operating postretirement income included in Other income, net was $1 million in 2021, compared with expense of $16 million in 2020 and $107
million in 2019. The increased income in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to lower interest cost. The decreased expense in 2020 compared to 2019
was due to lower interest cost.

Interest and debt expense increased by $526 million in 2021 and increased by $1,434 million in 2020 as a result of higher average debt balances.

Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)

Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.
Our  BCA  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales.  Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  each
commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales
percentage  applicable  to  the  total  remaining  program.  For  long-term  contracts,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.
Substantially  all contracts  at  our  BDS segment  and  certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  are  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  and
other customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.

Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, orders
where customers have the unilateral right to terminate, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual
backlog during 2021 was primarily due to new orders, reclassifications  from unobligated backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts,  increases in
price  escalation  and  reductions  in  the  number  of  existing  orders  that  in  our  assessment  do  not  meet  the  accounting  requirements  of  Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by deliveries and cancellations. During 2021, we have had higher ASC 606
adjustments of 787 orders as a result of delivery delays related to inspections and rework. If 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we remain
unable to deliver 737 MAX aircraft in China for an extended period of time, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10 is
further  delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  to  backlog  and/or  significant  order  cancellations.  Additionally,  we  may  continue  to
experience  fewer  new orders  and increased  cancellations  across  all of our  commercial  airplane programs  as a result  of the COVID-19  pandemic
and associated impacts on demand.

Unobligated  backlog  includes  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  definitive  contracts  for  which  funding  has  not  been  authorized.  The  decrease  in
unobligated  backlog  in  2021  was  primarily  due  to  reclassifications  to  contractual  backlog  related  to  BDS  and  BGS  contracts,  partially  offset  by
contract awards.

Additional Considerations

Global Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs,
trade agreements or sanctions that may impact the company.

The  global  economy  continues  to  experience  significant  adverse  impacts  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  including  a  decline  in  overall  trade  in
general  and  in  aerospace  in  particular.  There  is  a  great  deal  of  uncertainty  regarding  the  duration,  scale  and  localization  of  these  impacts  to  the
global economy and governments are enacting a wide range of responses to mitigate the unfolding economic impacts. We are closely monitoring
the  current  impact  and  potential  future  economic  consequences  of  COVID-19  to  the  global  economy,  the  aerospace  sector  and  our  Company.
These adverse economic impacts have resulted in fewer orders than previously anticipated for our commercial aircraft.

The  current  state  of  U.S.-China  relations  remains  a  significant  watch  item.  China  is  a  very  significant  market  for  commercial  airplanes  and
represents a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. Since 2018, the U.S. and China imposed an escalating series of tariffs on
each  other’s  imports.  Certain  aircraft  parts  and  components  that  Boeing  procures  are  subject  to  these  tariffs.  The  U.S.  and  China  entered  into  a
Phase  I  agreement  in  January  2020.  However,  as  of  December  31,  2021,  implementation  of  this  agreement  is  incomplete  and  overall  diplomatic
relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated. We continue monitoring developments for potential adverse impacts to the Company.

Beginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S.
trading  partners  have  imposed,  or  announced  their  intention  to  impose,  tariffs  on  U.S.  goods.  In  May  2019,  the  U.S.  Government,  Mexico  and
Canada  reached  an  agreement  to  end  the  steel  and  aluminum  tariffs  between  these  countries.  Implementation  of  the  U.S./Mexico/Canada  Free
Trade Agreement (USMCA) will also result in lower tariffs. In October 2021, the U.S. and European Union (EU) announced an agreement to ease
steel and aluminum tariffs. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.

The  current  status  of  U.S.-Russia  relations  is  creating  an  adverse  climate  for  our  business.  The  U.S.  Government  continues  to  impose  and/or
consider imposing sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and export
restrictions  that  may  be  imposed  by  the  U.S.  Government  and  any  responses  from  Russia  that  could  directly  affect  our  supply  chain,  business
partners or customers. We also continue to support the 737 MAX return to service in Russia.

The U.S. and EU have been engaged in two long-running disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) relating to large civil aircraft. As part of
those disputes, in October 2019, the WTO authorized the U.S. to impose approximately $7.50 billion in annual tariffs on EU products in connection
with the EU’s provision of eight instances of launch aid subsidies to Airbus. Following this authorization, the U.S. began to impose 15% tariffs on
new Airbus airplanes imported into the U.S. as well as fuselages that Airbus manufactures in Europe and imports into the U.S. In October 2020, the
WTO authorized the EU to impose approximately $3.99 billion in annual tariffs on U.S. products in connection with a tax incentive used by Boeing in
Washington state that has since been repealed. Shortly thereafter, the EU began to impose 15% tariffs on Boeing airplanes imported into the EU.
On June 15, 2021, the U.S. and EU announced that they had reached a cooperative framework to address the large civil aircraft disputes. As part of
the framework, among other items, both sides announced an intent to continue to suspend tariffs related to the disputes for five years. The U.S. and
U.K. announced a similar agreement on June 17, 2021.

Airline  Industry  Environment  See  Overview  to  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  for  a
discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.

Industry Competitiveness The industry continues to adjust to the unprecedented COVID-19 shock and subsequent economic impact, government
restrictions and new regulations. The commercial airplane market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts and
responses  have  varied  globally,  the  reduction  of  demand  and  disruption  in  production  has  adversely  impacted  most  manufacturers  in  the
commercial airplane industry.

Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately
80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on
increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the
737  MAX  and  the  associated  suspension  of  737  MAX  deliveries  in  multiple  jurisdictions  significantly  reduced  our  market  share  with  respect  to
deliveries of single aisle aircraft in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market
share. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of
a  majority  share  of  Bombardier’s  C  Series  (now  A220)  in  2018,  Airbus  continues  to  expand  in  the  100-150  seat  transcontinental  market.  Other
competitors  are  also  in  different  phases  of  developing  commercial  jet  aircraft.  Some  of  these  competitors  have  historically  enjoyed  access  to
government-provided  financial  support,  including  “launch  aid,”  which  greatly  reduces  the  cost  and  commercial  risks  associated  with  airplane
development  activities.  This  has  enabled  the  development  of  airplanes  without  broad  commercial  viability;  others  to  be  brought  to  market  more
quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency,
which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense
pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.

We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts, which enhances our ability to compete
and  positions  us  for  market  recovery.  We  are  also  focused  on  taking  actions  to  ensure  that  Boeing  is  not  harmed  by  unfair  subsidization  of
competitors.

BCA  revenues  increased  by  $3,331  million  in  2021  compared  with  2020  primarily  due  to  higher  737  MAX  deliveries  driven  by  recertification  and
return to service in most jurisdictions and the absence of charges for 737 MAX customer considerations which reduced revenues in 2020, partially
offset by lower 787 deliveries in 2021.

BCA revenues decreased by $16,093 million in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower deliveries primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic, 787 production issues and the 737 MAX grounding. This was partially offset by lower charges related to estimated potential concessions
and other considerations to 737 MAX customers of $498 million in 2020 compared with $8,259 million in 2019.

We resumed deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft  in December 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding order.  As of December 31, 2021,
most  non-U.S.  jurisdictions  have  approved  return  to  service  of  the  737  MAX.  787  deliveries  have  been  paused  since  May  2021.  Revenues  will
continue to be impacted until deliveries of the 737 MAX ramp up, deliveries of the 787 resume and the commercial airline industry recovers from the
impacts of COVID-19.

Loss From Operations

BCA loss from operations was $6,475 million in 2021 compared with $13,847 million in 2020. The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the
787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787
program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020
loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.

BCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X
of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, $2,567 million of abnormal production costs
related to 737 MAX, $623 million of severance cost, $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting
component  repair  costs  and  $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in
response  to  COVID-19,  partially  offset  by  lower research  and development  spending.  Lower 787 margins  reflecting  a reduction  in the accounting
quantity  in the first  quarter  of 2020 also contributed  to  lower earnings.  The 2019 loss  primarily  reflects  the absence of 737 MAX deliveries  in the
second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.

Lower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins
until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.

Backlog

Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where
we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to
perform.  Backlog  does  not  include  prospective  orders  where  customer  controlled  contingencies  remain,  such  as  the  customer  receiving  approval
from  its  board  of  directors,  shareholders  or  government  or  completing  financing  arrangements.  All  such  contingencies  must  be  satisfied  or  have
expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders as well as
orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject
individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer

34

Table of Contents

claims  and  requests  for  other  contractual  relief  as  they  arise.  The  value  of  orders  in  backlog  is  adjusted  as  changes  to  price  and  schedule  are
agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASC 606.

BCA  total  backlog  of  $296,882  million  at  December  31,  2021  increased  from  $281,588  million  at  December  31,  2020,  reflecting  new  orders  in
excess of deliveries, increases in projected price escalation and decreases in the number of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the
accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by aircraft order cancellations. Aircraft order cancellations during the
year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $27,542 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX and 787 aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments decreased
for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in an increase to backlog of $3,810 million primarily due to 777X aircraft, partially offset by
787  aircraft.  ASC  606  adjustments  include  consideration  of  aircraft  orders  where  a  customer  controlled  contingency  may  exist,  as  well  as  an
assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration
when it is due. If 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we are unable to ramp up deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft, and/or if entry into service of
the  777X,  737  MAX  7  and/or  737  MAX  10  is  further  delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  to  backlog  and/or  significant  order
cancellations.  Additionally,  we  may  continue  to  experience  fewer  new  orders  and  increased  cancellations  across  all  of  our  commercial  airplane
programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.

Accounting Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  and
anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue
and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a
program’s  life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  that
program,  including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective  customers  and  market  studies.  We  review  our  program  accounting  quantities
quarterly.

The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to be
under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity
must be considered.

The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent
the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include military derivative aircraft that are not

Program Highlights

737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2021 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining
additional orders and delivering airplanes. See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

747 Program We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We expect to complete production of the 747 in the second half of 2022.
We believe that ending production of the 747 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 36 units during 2021 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining
additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the tanker program.
The commercial program has near break-even gross margins. We are currently producing at a rate of 3 aircraft per month.

777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2021 due to the program’s normal progress of
obtaining  additional  orders  and  delivering  airplanes.  The  production  rate  for  the  combined  777/777X  program  is  expected  to  increase  from  2  per
month to 3 per month in 2022.

In 2013, we launched the 777X-8 and 777X-9, which feature new composite wings, new engines and folding wing-tips. The first flight of the 777X
was completed during the first quarter of 2020. In 2021, we began offering the 777X freighter to customers and expect to receive initial orders in
2022.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss
on the 777X program. The revised schedule and reach-

36

Table of Contents

forward loss reflected a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions
with regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarter of 2020 to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment of
COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand  and  discussions  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  aircraft  delivery  timing.  These  factors  resulted  in
adjustments to production rates and the program accounting quantity, increased change incorporation costs, and associated customer and supply
chain impacts. The initial accounting quantity of 350 airplanes established in the fourth quarter of 2020 consists of 777X passenger airplanes and
remained unchanged during 2021.

We are working towards reaching Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA
and  certification  will  ultimately  be  determined  by  the  regulators,  and  further  determinations  with  respect  to  anticipated  certification  requirements
could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.

We continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31,
2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the
impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further production
rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the
testing  program  and  the  timing  of  aircraft  certification.  One  or  more  of  these  factors  could  result  in  additional  reach-forward  losses  on  the  777X
program in future periods.

787  Program During  2020,  we  experienced  significant  reductions  in  deliveries  due  to  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  our  customers  as  well  as
production issues and associated rework. During 2021 we delivered 14 aircraft between March 2021 and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused
in May 2021. Deliveries remain paused.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had approximately 110 and 80 aircraft in inventory. We have identified production quality issues, including in
our supply chain, which have contributed to the pause in deliveries. In July 2021, we announced that we were reprioritizing production resources to
support inspections and rework. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the
FAA  regarding  required  actions  for  resuming  delivery  of  the  787.  We  are  currently  producing  at  very  low  rates  and  expect  that  to  continue  until
deliveries  resume,  gradually  returning  to  5  per  month  over  time.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  we  determined  that  in  the  current  environment
production  rates  below 5 per month  represent  abnormally  low production  rates  and result  in abnormal  production  costs,  and that  inspections  and
rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed
as incurred. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that the ongoing rework, as well as our ongoing discussions with the FAA in anticipation of
resumption  of  deliveries,  will  result  in  lower  production  rates  longer  than  previously  expected.  As  a  result  of  these  impacts,  we  expect  to  incur
approximately $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis with most being incurred by the end of 2023. We continue to work with
customers  and  suppliers  regarding  timing  of  future  deliveries  and  production  rate  changes.  We  are  also  continuing  to  implement  changes  in  the
production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. During
the first quarter of 2021, we consolidated 787 production in South Carolina, in line with our previous assumptions, which did not have a significant
financial impact on the program.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other actions
required to resume 787 deliveries, taking longer than

37

Table of Contents

expected. These impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated customer considerations.

The  timing  of  the  resumption  of  deliveries  and  future  production  rates  will  depend  upon  rework,  ongoing  customer  and  supplier  engagement,
production  stability  and  our  activities  with  the  FAA.  China  is  a  significant  market  for  the  787  program,  and  if  the  program  is  unable  to  obtain
additional  orders  from  China  in  future  quarters,  we  may  be  required  to  further  adjust  production  rate  assumptions.  If  we  are  required  to  further
reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays or experience other factors that result in lower margins,
the program could record additional losses and higher abnormal production costs in future periods.

Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.
Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life
of  the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  and
technical  data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately  1%  of  total
consolidated costs of products and services.

Program  Development The  following  chart  summarizes  the  time  horizon  between  go-ahead  and  planned  initial  delivery  for  major  Commercial
Airplanes derivatives and programs.

The development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements.  The timing of
certifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.

Additional Considerations

The  development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  with
suppliers  and highly-skilled  labor  from  employees  and other  partners.  Meeting  or  exceeding our performance  and reliability  standards,  as  well as
those  of  customers  and  regulators,  can  be  costly  and  technologically  challenging,  such  as  the  787  production  issues  and  associated  rework.  In
addition,  the  introduction  of  new  aircraft  and  derivatives,  such  as  the  777X  and  737  MAX  derivatives,  involves  increased  risks  associated  with
meeting  development,  production  and  certification  schedules.  These  challenges  include  increased  global  regulatory  scrutiny  of  all  development
aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft  on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and
achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge
if  an  airplane  program  has  or  is  determined  to  have  reach-forward  losses)  include  the  following:  changes  to  the  program  accounting  quantity,
customer  and  model  mix,  production  costs  and  rates,  changes  to  price  escalation  factors  due  to  changes  in  the  inflation  rate  or  other  economic
indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding
new  production  capacity,  learning  curve,  additional  change  incorporation,  achieving  anticipated  cost  reductions,  the  addition  of  regulatory
requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new
airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost
and revenue estimates

38

Table of Contents

incorporated  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  appropriate,  the  technical  complexity  of  our  airplane  programs  creates  financial  risk  as
additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order
cancellations or other financially significant exposure.

Defense, Space & Security

Business Environment and Trends

United States Government Defense Environment Overview

In May 2021, the U.S. government released the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2022 (FY22), which included $715 billion in funding for the
United  States  Department  of  Defense  (U.S.  DoD),  $25  billion  in  funding  for  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  and  $19
billion for the FAA. While the President’s budget request for FY22 includes funding for a majority of Boeing’s programs, it did not include funding for
F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8 Poseidon and CH-47F Block II production aircraft. While there is continued congressional support for F/A-18 and CH-47F
Block II production aircraft for FY22, there is ongoing uncertainty with respect to these and other program-level appropriations for FY22 and future
fiscal years. These programs also continue to pursue non-U.S. sales opportunities.

In  December  2021,  Congress  passed  and  the  President  signed  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY22,  which  authorizes  a  U.S.  DoD
budget  $25  billion  higher  than  the  budget  request.  A  CR,  enacted  on  December  3,  2021,  continues  funding  for  the  federal  government  at  FY21
appropriated levels through February 18, 2022. Congress and the President must enact either full-year FY22 appropriations bills or an additional CR
to  fund  government  departments  and  agencies  beyond  February  18,  2022  or  a  government  shutdown  could  result,  which  may  impact  the
Company’s  operations.  Alternatively,  Congress  may  continue  to  fund  the  federal  government  through  one  or  more  additional  CRs,  however,  this
would continue to restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.

Accordingly,  there  continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  DoD  and  other  government  agencies,
including NASA, for FY22 and beyond. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and
appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a
material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows.

Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need
to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the
Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2021, 33% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.

Since  our  operating  cycle  is  long-term  and  involves  many  different  types  of  development  and  production  contracts  with  varying  delivery  and
milestone  schedules,  the  operating  results  of  a  particular  period  may  not  be  indicative  of  future  operating  results.  In  addition,  depending  on  the
customer  and  their  funding  sources,  our  orders  might  be  structured  as  annual  follow-on  contracts,  or  as  one  large  multi-year  order  or  long-term
award.  As  a  result,  period-to-period  comparisons  of  backlog  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  future  workloads.  The  following  discussions  of

BDS revenues in 2021 increased by $283 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program due to new
orders for 27 aircraft received during the first quarter of 2021 and lower charges in 2021. This was partially offset by lower revenues on rotorcraft
programs, Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than the prior year,
largely due to the lower charges described below.

BDS revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52
upgrades, proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impact
of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $312 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, largely due to the KC-46A
Tanker charges during 2020.

Earnings From Operations

BDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2021  increased  by  $5  million  compared  with  2020  primarily  due  to  less  unfavorable  impacts  from  cumulative
contract catch-up adjustments, which improved $219 million from the prior year, largely due to lower KC-46A Tanker charges in 2021 compared to
2020 and other charges in development programs described below. The favorable change in cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was offset
primarily by lower volume and mix on rotorcraft programs and lower equity earnings for United Launch Alliance (ULA).

During the fourth quarter of 2021, BDS increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $402 million primarily due to continued
disruption  in  the  factory  and  in  the  supply  chain,  including  impacts  of  COVID-19,  and  an  increase  in  costs  to  complete  the  new  Remote  Vision
System as the customer’s requirements definition has evolved. In 2020, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $1,320 million on the KC-
46A Tanker program reflecting $551 million of costs associated

with the agreement signed in April 2020 with the U.S. Air Force to develop and integrate the new Remote Vision System, and costs for production
inefficiencies including impacts of COVID-19 disruption.

During  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  we  increased  the  reach-forward  loss  on  Commercial  Crew  by  $185  million  driven  by  the  delay  in  the  second
uncrewed Orbital Flight Test now anticipated in 2022 and the latest assessment of remaining work.

During the first quarter of 2021, we increased the reach-forward loss on VC-25B by $318 million, which was largely due to COVID-19 impacts and
performance issues at a key supplier. The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering
inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.

BDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the  unfavorable  impact  of  cumulative
contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-
46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect
lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases
described above.

BDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million
primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Backlog

Total backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue
recognized.

Additional Considerations

Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have
cost-type  contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program
cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Examples  of  these  programs  include  Ground-based  Midcourse  Defense,
Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.

Some of  our development  programs  are  contracted  on a  fixed-price  basis,  and BDS customers  are increasingly  seeking fixed-price  proposals  for
new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-
25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs
could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have
highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could
increase  our  estimated  cost  to  perform  the  work  or  reduce  our  estimated  price,  either  of  which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise
adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial
statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary
or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments or other
financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.

Global Services

Business Environment and Trends

The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training
and professional services; and information services. Prior to COVID-19, we had expected the market to grow by around 3.5% annually, however, the
pandemic  is  having  a  direct  impact  on  our  commercial  services  business.  See  Overview  to  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.

Over the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to
increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance
to  improve  their  productivity  and  efficiency.  Airlines  continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  reduce  the  size  and  cost  of  their  spare  parts  inventory,
frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.

The  demand  outlook  for  our  government  services  business  has  remained  stable  in  2021.  Government  services  market  segments  are  growing  on
pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual
market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and
non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect
less  than  20  percent  of  the  worldwide  fleet  of  military  aircraft  to  be  retired  and  replaced  over  the  next  ten  years,  driving  increased  demand  for
services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.

BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 39, which could restrict the
execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.

Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment
has resulted in intense pressures on pricing, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global
markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

BGS  revenues  in  2021  increased  by  $785  million  compared  with  2020  due  to  higher  commercial  and  government  services  volume.  While
commercial  services  volume  is  recovering,  it  remains  below  pre-pandemic  levels.  The  net  favorable  impact  of  cumulative  contract  catch-up
adjustments  in  2021  was  $37  million  lower  than  the  comparable  period  in  the  prior  year. We  expect  the  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  to
continue to have an adverse impact on BGS commercial revenues in future quarters until the commercial airline industry environment fully recovers.

42

Table of Contents

BGS  revenues  in  2020  decreased  by  $2,925  million  compared  with  2019  due  to  lower  commercial  services  revenue  driven  by  impacts  of  the
COVID-19 pandemic. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was $101 million lower than the comparable period
in the prior year.

Earnings From Operations

BGS earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $1,567 million compared with 2020, primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 driven by impacts
of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  as  well  as  higher  commercial  services  volume  in  2021,  partially  offset  by  an  inventory  write-down  of  $220  million
recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by revised cost estimates on certain customer contracts. Charges in 2020 included $531 million of
inventory write-downs, $178 million of related impairments of distribution rights primarily driven by airlines’ decisions to retire certain aircraft, $398
million  for  higher  expected  credit  losses  primarily  driven  by  customer  liquidity  issues,  $115  million  of  contract  termination  and  facility  impairment
charges, and $72 million of severance costs. The net favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 was $98 million lower
than the prior year.

BGS earnings from operations in 2020 decreased by $2,247 million compared with 2019, primarily due to lower commercial services revenue as well
as the 2020 earnings charges described in the previous paragraph. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was
consistent with the prior year.

Backlog

BGS total backlog of $20,496 million at December 31, 2021 decreased by 1% from $20,632 million at December 31, 2020, primarily due to revenue
recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.

Boeing Capital

Business Environment and Trends

BCC’s gross  customer  financing  and investment  portfolio  at December  31, 2021 totaled  $1,734 million.  A substantial  portion  of BCC’s portfolio  is
composed of customers that have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft
product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.

BCC  provided  customer  financing  of  $14  million  during  2020  and  none  during  2021.  While  we  may  be  required  to  fund  a  number  of  new  aircraft
deliveries  in  2021  and/or  provide  refinancing  for  existing  bridge  debt,  we  expect  alternative  financing  will  be  available  at  reasonable  prices  from
broad and globally diverse sources.

Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 5,300 western-built
commercial  jet  aircraft  (20.5%  of  current  world  fleet)  were  parked  at  the  end  of  2021,  including  both  in-production  and  out-of-production  aircraft
types.  Of  these  parked  aircraft,  a  larger  portion  are  expected  to  be  retired  compared  to  the  pre-COVID-19  period,  which  directly  impacts  the
Company  in  terms  of  number  of  new  aircraft  deliveries  and  financing  opportunities,  the  ability  of  existing  customers  to  meet  current  payment
obligations and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2020 and 2019,
29.4% and 8.5% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft,
particularly  types  with  relatively  few  operators,  are  placed  out  of  service.  See  Overview  to  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.

BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and
notes,  and other income. BCC’s revenues  in 2021 increased by $11 million compared  with 2020, and revenues  in 2020 increased by $17 million
compared with 2019 primarily due to gains on re-lease of assets, partially offset by portfolio run-off.

Earnings From Operations

BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation
on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $43 million compared with 2020 primarily due to
higher revenues, lower provision for losses, and lower interest and asset impairment expenses. Earnings from operations in 2020 increased by $35
million compared with 2019 primarily due to higher revenues, lower asset impairment expenses and lower interest expenses.

BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 decreased from December 31, 2020, primarily due to $241 million of note
payoffs and portfolio run-off.

BCC enters into certain transactions with other Boeing segments, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany
guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.

Operating Activities Net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion during 2021, compared with $18.4 billion during 2020 and $2.4 billion
during  2019.  The  reduction  in  cash  used  by  operating  activities  in  2021  compared  with  2020  is  primarily  driven  by  lower  net  loss  and  improved
changes in assets and liabilities. Non-cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as a
reduction to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share-
based  plans  expense  reflecting  a  one-time  stock  grant  to  most  employees  in  lieu  of  2021  salary  increases. The  changes  in  assets  and  liabilities
reflect the significant increase in commercial airplane inventory in 2020 driven by lower deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX
grounding. In 2021, inventory growth slowed as the continued buildup of 787 aircraft caused by production issues and 777X inventory growth was
partially offset by a decrease in 737 MAX inventory following the resumption of deliveries. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled
$2.5 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021 and 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we paid $0.7 billion consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution
Agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Additionally, in 2021, we received income tax refunds of $1.7 billion. Cash provided
by Advances and progress billings was $2.5 billion in 2021, as compared with Cash used by Advances and progress billings of $1.1 billion in 2020.
The  pause  in  787  deliveries  and  the  residual  impacts  of  the  737  MAX  grounding  are  expected  to  continue  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our
operating cash flows until 787 deliveries resume and 737 MAX deliveries ramp up.

The decrease in operating cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily  driven by our net loss in 2020 and changes in assets and liabilities,
partially offset  by an increase in non-cash items. Non-cash items include the $6.5 billion reach-forward  loss on the 777X program in 2020, which
was  recorded  as  a  reduction  to  inventory.  The  year-over-year  increase  in  non-cash  items  also  reflects  higher  inventory  write-downs  and  higher
allowances for expected  credit losses  in 2020. The changes in assets  and liabilities  reflect  increases in commercial  airplane inventory  due to the
large  number  of  undelivered  aircraft  in  2019  resulting  from  the  737  MAX  grounding,  and in  2020  due  to  the  737  MAX  grounding,  787  production
issues and COVID-19 impacts. Cash used by Advances and progress billings was $1.1 billion in 2020, as compared with $0.7 billion provided by
Advances  and  progress  billings  in  2019.  The  changes  in  assets  and  liabilities  in  2020  also  reflect  lower  accounts  payable  due  to  reductions  in
commercial purchases from suppliers and lower supply chain financing. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.2 billion during
2020 and $1.2 billion during 2019. The accrued liability

45

Table of Contents

for 737 MAX customer considerations at December 31, 2019 resulted in a $7.4 billion favorable change to assets and liabilities in 2019.

Payables  to  suppliers  who  elected  to  participate  in  supply  chain  financing  programs  declined  by  $1.5  billion  and  $1.9  billion  for  the  years  ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, and increased by $2.6 billion in 2019. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The declines for
the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers. The increase for the year
ended  December  31,  2019  reflects  a  combination  of  higher  purchases,  an  extension  of  payment  terms  with  certain  suppliers  and  increased
utilization of our supply chain financing programs.

Investing Activities Cash  provided  by  investing  activities  during  2021 was  $9.3 billion,  compared  with  cash  used by  investing  activities  of  $18.4
billion and $1.5 billion during 2020 and 2019. The increase in cash inflows in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to $27.1 billion of higher net
proceeds from investments. The increase in cash outflows in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to $17.4 billion of higher net contributions to
investments. Net proceeds from investments were $9.8 billion in 2021, compared with net contributions to investments of $17.3 billion in 2020 and
net proceeds from investments of $0.1 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures totaled $1.0 billion in 2021, compared with $1.3 billion in 2020 and $1.8
billion  in  2019.  We  reduced  our  capital  expenditures  in  2021  and  2020  as  we  managed  our  liquidity  throughout  the  pandemic  and  737  MAX
grounding. We expect capital expenditures in 2022 to be higher than in 2021.

Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $5.6 billion during 2021, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $35.0
billion  during  2020  and  $5.7  billion  in  2019.  The  decrease  of  $40.6  billion  compared  with  2020  primarily  reflects  net  debt  repayments  in  2021
compared  with  net  borrowings  in  2020.  The  increase  of  $29.3  billion  in  2020  compared  with  2019  primarily  reflects  higher  net  borrowings,  lower
share repurchases and lower dividend payments, which reflects the Company’s decision in March 2020 to suspend the declaration or payment of
dividends  until  further  notice.  During  the  twelve  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  debt  repayments  net  of  new  borrowings  were  $5.6  billion,
primarily  due  to  $13.8  billion  of  repayments  of  our  two-year  delayed  draw  term  loan  credit  agreement,  partially  offset  by  $9.8  billion  of  fixed  rate
senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2021. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, new borrowings net of repayments were $36.3
billion, primarily due to $29.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in 2020 and $13.8 billion of new borrowings under a two-year delayed draw
term  loan  agreement  entered  into  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020.  During  the  twelve  months  ended  December  31,  2019,  new  borrowings  net  of
repayments were $13.2 billion, primarily due to the issuance of $10.5 billion of fixed rate senior notes in 2019. For further discussion see Liquidity
Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020 debt balances totaled $58.1 billion and $63.6 billion, of which $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion were classified as short-
term. This included $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of debt attributable to BCC at December 31, 2021 and 2020, of which $0.3 billion and $0.9 billion
were classified as short-term.

During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  we  did  not  repurchase  any  shares  through  our  open  market  share  repurchase  program
compared  to  repurchases  of  6.9  million  shares  in  2019  totaling  $2.7  billion.  Share  repurchases  under  this  plan  have  been  suspended  since  April
2019. In March 2020, the Board of Directors terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock.
We had 0.3 million, 0.6 million and 0.6 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During
the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  paid  no  dividends,  compared  with  $1.2  billion  and  $4.6  billion  in  2020  and  2019.  In  March  2020,  the
Company announced that our dividend will be suspended until further notice.

We  expect  to  be  able  to  fund  our  cash  requirements  through  cash  and  short-term  investments  and  cash  provided  by  operations,  as  well  as
continued access to capital markets. At December 31, 2021, we had $8.1 billion of cash, $8.2 billion of short-term investments, and $14.7 billion of
unused  borrowing  capacity  on  revolving  credit  line  agreements.  We  anticipate  that  these  revolving  credit  lines  will  remain  undrawn  and  primarily
serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Of the $14.7 billion of unused borrowing capacity, $6.3 billion expires in
October 2022, $5.3 billion expires in March 2023 and $3.2 billion expires in October 2024.

Our debt balances have increased significantly since 2019, and we are continuing to actively manage our liquidity. In 2021, we repaid $13.8 billion
that was outstanding under our two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement that had a final maturity date of February 6, 2022.

Our increased debt balance resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings in 2020, and our ratings remained unchanged in 2021. We expect to be
able to access capital markets when we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to
market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements. A number of factors could cause us to incur
increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines
in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, including impacts described above related to the
COVID-19 pandemic and/or associated changes in demand for our products and services. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to
further credit rating downgrades. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or
contractual commitments.

Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with
the  covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  a  limitation  on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leaseback
transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements) and a limitation on consolidated debt as a
percentage  of  total  capital  (as  defined  in  the  credit  agreements).  When  considering  debt  covenants,  we  continue  to  have  substantial  borrowing
capacity.

pursuant to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates
of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded
through trusts.

At  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  our  pension  plans  were  $7.8  billion  and  $13.7  billion  underfunded  as  measured  under  Generally  Accepted
Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP). On an ERISA basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2021.
We do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2022. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension
plans in future years.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3 billion of our common stock to our pension fund. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we also began using
our common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans for the foreseeable future. Under this approach, common stock
is contributed to our 401(k) plans following each pay period. We expect this measure to further  enable the Company to conserve cash. We have
retained an independent fiduciary to manage and liquidate stock contributed to these plans at its discretion.

Purchase Obligations Purchase  obligations  represent  contractual  agreements  to  purchase  goods  or  services  that  are  legally  binding;  specify  a
fixed,  minimum  or  range  of  quantities;  specify  a  fixed,  minimum,  variable  or  indexed  price  provision;  and  specify  approximate  timing  of  the
transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position.

Purchase  obligations  not  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position  include  agreements  for  inventory  procurement,  tooling
costs,  electricity  and  natural  gas  contracts,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  customer  financing  equipment  and  other  miscellaneous  production
related  obligations.  The  most  significant  obligation  relates  to  inventory  procurement  contracts.  We  have  entered  into  certain  significant  inventory
procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on
behalf  of  our  suppliers.  These  agreements  require  suppliers  and  vendors  to  be  prepared  to  build  and  deliver  items  in  sufficient  time  to  meet  our
production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many
of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts with customers and/or has historically resulted in
settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are
also  included  in  our  forecasts  of  costs  for  program  and  contract  accounting.  Some  inventory  procurement  contracts  may  include  escalation
adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the
table above.

Purchase  obligations recorded  on the Consolidated Statements  of Financial Position primarily  include accounts  payable and certain other  current
and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.

We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or
technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These
commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply
contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties
(such  as  our  vendors)  who  purchase  supplies  from  our  non-U.S.  customers.  In  certain  cases,  penalties  could  be  imposed  if  we  do  not  meet  our
industrial  participation  commitments.  During  2021,  we  incurred  no  such  penalties.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  have  outstanding  industrial
participation agreements

48

Table of Contents

totaling  $25.5  billion  that  extend  through  2034.  Purchase  order  commitments  associated  with  industrial  participation  agreements  are  included  in
purchase  obligations  in  the  table  above.  To  be  eligible  for  such  a  purchase  order  commitment  from  us,  a  non-U.S.  supplier  must  have  sufficient
capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these
arrangements, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commercial  aircraft  financing  commitments  include  commitments  to  provide  financing  related  to  aircraft  on  order,  under  option  for  deliveries  or
proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Customer
financing commitments totaled $12.9 billion and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase relates to new financing commitments.
We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers
to  provide  alternative  financing  to  customers.  Historically,  we  have  not  been  required  to  fund  significant  amounts  of  outstanding  commitments.
However,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  we  will  not  be  required  to  fund  greater  amounts  than  historically  required.  See  Note  13  to  our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingent Obligations

We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:

Legal Various  legal  proceedings,  claims  and  investigations  are  pending  against  us.  Legal  contingencies  are  discussed  in  Note  21  to  our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Remediation We  are  involved  with  various  environmental  remediation  activities  and  have  recorded  a  liability  of  $605  million  at
December 31, 2021. For additional information, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-GAAP Measures

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information.
These  non-GAAP  measures  should  not  be  considered  in  isolation  or  as  a  substitute  for  the  related  GAAP  measures,  and  other  companies  may
define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely
on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost
adjustment. The FAS/

49

Table of Contents

CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs
calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment
and  non-operating  pension  and  postretirement  expenses.  Non-operating  pension  and  postretirement  expenses  represent  the  components  of  net
periodic  benefit  costs  other  than  service  cost.  Pension costs,  comprising  service  and prior  service  costs  computed  in accordance  with GAAP are
allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting
government  customers  are  computed  in  accordance  with  U.S.  Government  Cost  Accounting  Standards  (CAS),  which  employ  different  actuarial
assumptions  and  accounting  conventions  than  GAAP.  CAS  costs  are  allocable  to  government  contracts.  Other  postretirement  benefit  costs  are
allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.

The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Loss from operations were benefits of $882 million in 2021, $1,024 million in 2020
and $1,071 million in 2019. The lower benefits in 2021 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating
pension expense included in Other  income,  net was a benefit  of $528 million in 2021, $340 million in 2020 and $374 million in 2019. The higher
benefits  in  2021  were  primarily  due  to  lower  interest  cost  and  higher  expected  return  on  plan  assets,  partially  offset  by  higher  amortization  of
actuarial losses and higher settlement charges. The benefits in 2020 and 2019 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of
actuarial losses.

For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 29 of this Form 10-K and
see Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Management  uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per
share  for  purposes  of  evaluating  and forecasting  underlying  business  performance.  Management  believes these  core  earnings  measures  provide
investors  additional  insights  into  operational  performance  as  unallocated  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  cost  primarily  represent  costs
driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP
and costs allocated to the business segments. This adjustment is excluded from Core operating loss (non-GAAP).
Non-operating  pension  and  postretirement  expenses  represent  the  components  of  net  periodic  benefit  costs  other  than  service  cost.  These
expenses are included in Other income, net and are excluded from Core loss per share (non-GAAP).
The income tax impact is calculated using the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate.

Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates

Accounting for Long-term Contracts

Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct
performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service
of integration that we provide.

Accounting  for  long-term  contracts  involves  a  judgmental  process  of  estimating  the  total  sales,  costs,  and  profit  for  each  performance  obligation.
Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported
as cost of sales.

Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated
and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding
contract  options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  as
inflation  or  index-based  clauses).  The  majority  of  these  long-term  contracts  are  with  the  U.S.  government  where  the  price  is  generally  based  on
estimated  cost  to  produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be
reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  Total  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historical
performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and
schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, COVID-19 disruptions, asset utilization and anticipated
labor agreements.

Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these
estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales
and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward  loss or an
adjustment to a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, net
unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments across all long-term contracts increased loss from operations by $880 million, $942 million and $111
million,  respectively.  The  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  in  2021  were  primarily  due  to  losses  recognized  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker,  VC-25B  and
Commercial  Crew  programs.  These  are  all  fixed-price  development  programs,  and  there  is  ongoing  risk  that  similar  losses  may  have  to  be
recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we
used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance,
or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-
term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2021, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by
approximately $300 million.

Program Accounting

Program  accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  revenues,  costs  and  gross  profit  margin  for  the  defined  program
accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-
term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to
make reasonably dependable estimates.

52

Table of Contents

Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part
costs,  major  component  costs,  overhead  costs,  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs,  and  warranty  costs.  Estimation  of  the  accounting
quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters
of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price
for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for
all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based
largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated  contracts  with  suppliers,  historical  performance  trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economic  projections.
Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or
assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.

To  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  This  includes
reassessing  the  accounting  quantity.  Changes  in  estimates  of  program  gross  profit  margins  are  normally  recognized  on  a  prospective  basis;
however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss
is  recorded  in  the  current  period.  Reductions  to  the  estimated  loss  are  included  in the  gross  profit  margin  for  undelivered  units  in the  accounting
quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.

The 747, 767 and 777X programs have near break-even margins, and the 787 program has zero margin at December 31, 2021. Adverse changes
to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in additional earnings charges in future periods.

777X Program During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billion
reach-forward  loss  on  the  777X  program.  The  revised  schedule  and  reach-forward  loss  reflected  a  number  of  factors,  including  an  updated
assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarter
of 2020 to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand and discussions with our
customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program accounting quantity,
increased  change  incorporation  costs,  and  associated  customer  and  supply  chain  impacts.  The  initial  accounting  quantity  of  350  airplanes
established in the fourth quarter of 2020 consists of 777X passenger airplanes and remained unchanged during 2021.

We are working towards reaching TIA which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification will ultimately
be determined by the regulators, and further determinations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in
entry into service and/or additional cost increases.

We continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31,
2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the
impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further production
rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the
testing  program  and  the  timing  of  aircraft  certification.  One  or  more  of  these  factors  could  result  in  additional  reach-forward  losses  on  the  777X
program in future periods, which may be material.

53

Table of Contents

787 Program The 787 program’s production issues and delivery pause result in significant uncertainties regarding the revenue and cost estimates
for the 787 program. Deliveries have remained paused since May 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the
program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. The estimate
of  customer  considerations  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  our  current  assumptions  regarding  timing  of  FAA  approval  enabling
resumption  of  deliveries,  estimated  timing  of  completion  of  inspections  and  rework  to  enable  deliveries  in  future  periods,  estimated  timing  of
production  rate  increases  as  well  as  customer  and  market  assessments.  We  continue  to  conduct  inspections  and  rework  and  engage in  detailed
discussions  with  the  FAA  regarding  required  actions  for  resuming  delivery  of  the  787.  Our  program  revenue  and  cost  estimates  reflect  the
assumption that production rates will remain very low until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 per month over time. We have also assumed
lower  forecasted  revenues  due  to  delayed  deliveries.  Our  program  assumptions  reflect  our  current  best  estimate.  However,  if  the  program
experiences further delivery delays or other factors such as additional inspections or rework that result in lower revenue or higher cost estimates, we
could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.

Goodwill Impairments

We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we
evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. If we determine it is more
likely  than  not  that  the  carrying  value  of  the  net  assets  is  more  than  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit,  then  a  quantitative  test  is  performed;
otherwise, no further testing is required. For reporting units where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the
goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.

We generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies
such as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs
and changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates and delivery profiles,
contracts  with  suppliers,  labor  agreements  and  general  market  conditions.  Changes  in  these  forecasts  could  significantly  change  the  amount  of
impairment  recorded,  if  any.  The  cash  flow  forecasts  are  adjusted  by  an  appropriate  discount  rate  derived  from  our  market  capitalization  plus  a
suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.

We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31,
2021,  we  estimated  that  the  fair  value  of  each  reporting  unit  significantly  exceeded  its  corresponding  carrying  value.  Changes  in  our  forecasts,
discount  rates  or  decreases  in  the  value  of  our  common  stock  could  cause  book  values  to  exceed  their  fair  values  which  may  result  in  goodwill
impairment charges in future periods.

Pension Plans

Many  of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union
employees  transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans  effective  January  1,  2019.  Accounting  rules  require  an
annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount
rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected

54

Table of Contents

outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.

The  projected  benefit  obligation  is  sensitive  to  discount  rates.  The  projected  benefit  obligation  would  decrease  by  $2,240  million  or  increase  by
$2,530  million  if  the  discount  rate  increased  or  decreased  by  25  basis  points.  A  25  basis  point  change  in  the  discount  rate  would  not  have  a
significant  impact  on  pension  cost.  However,  net  periodic  pension  cost  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.  A
decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2021 net periodic pension
cost by $155 million. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes the discount rate and expected long-term
rate of asset return assumptions for the last three years.

Deferred Income Taxes – Valuation Allowance

The Company has deferred income tax assets of $11,258 million at December 31, 2021 that can be used in future years to offset taxable income
and reduce income taxes payable. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities of $8,976 million at December 31, 2021 that will partially offset
deferred  income  tax  assets  and  result  in  higher  taxable  income  in  future  years  and  increase  income  taxes  payable.  Tax  law  determines  whether
future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in
which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or
settlement of the related liability.

On a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and
reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not
(defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.

This  assessment  takes  into  account  both  positive  and  negative  evidence.  A  recent  history  of  financial  reporting  losses  is  heavily  weighted  as  a
source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. Due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not include future projected earnings
in our analysis. Rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income
and  when  deferred  tax  assets  will  reverse  and  generate  tax  deductions.  The  selection  of  methodologies  and  assessment  of  when  temporary
differences  will  result  in  taxable  or  deductible  amounts  involves  significant  management  judgment  and  is  inherently  complex  and  subjective.  We
believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.

Deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the
next five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significant
deductible amounts beyond five years. The Company’s valuation allowance of $2,423 million at December 31, 2021 primarily relates to pension and
other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities
are assumed to occur. During 2021, the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $671 primarily due to favorable pension remeasurement.
Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse
impacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive income.

For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets
and  liabilities.  The  investors  in  our  fixed-rate  debt  obligations  do  not  generally  have  the  right  to  demand  we  pay  off  these  obligations  prior  to
maturity.  Therefore,  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  is  not  believed  to  be  material  for  our  fixed-rate  debt.  In  2021,  we  repaid  the  $13.8  billion
outstanding under our two-year floating-rate delayed draw term loan credit agreement. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, we do not have any
significant  floating-rate  debt  obligations.  Historically,  we  have  not  experienced  material  gains  or  losses  on  our  customer  financing  assets  and
liabilities due to interest rate changes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use
foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  and
receipts  related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  At
December  31,  2021,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  or
decreased our unrealized losses by $241 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,
such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions
being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.

Commodity Price Risk

We  are  subject  to  commodity  price  risk  relating  to  commodity  purchase  contracts  for  items  used  in  production  that  are  subject  to  changes  in  the
market  price.  We  use  commodity  swaps  and  commodity  purchase  contracts  to  hedge  against  these  potentially  unfavorable  price  changes.  Our
commodity  purchase  contracts  and  derivatives  are  both  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  market  price.  At  December  31,  2021,  a  10%  increase  or
decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $46 million. Consistent with
the  use  of  these  contracts  to  neutralize  the  effect  of  market  price  fluctuations,  such  unrealized  losses  or  gains  would  be  offset  by  corresponding
gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase
contracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk.

The Boeing Company and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019
(Dollars in millions, except otherwise stated)

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as
“Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities
that  are  required  to  be  consolidated.  All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.  As  described  in  Note  22,  we
operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS) and Boeing Capital
(BCC).

Liquidity Matters

The global outbreak of COVID-19, 787 production issues and associated rework, and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding continue to
have significant adverse impacts on our business and are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow in
future  quarters.  The COVID-19  pandemic  has caused  an unprecedented  shock  to demand for  air travel,  creating  a tremendous  challenge for  our
customers, our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and services sector. We continue to expect commercial air travel to
return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We expect it will take a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth. There is
significant uncertainty  with respect to when commercial  air traffic levels will recover,  and whether, and at what point capacity will return to and/or
exceed pre-COVID-19 levels.

During 2021, net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion. Our operating cash flows continue to be impacted by lower commercial airplane
deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers. We expect negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramp up. In 2021, we
issued $9.8 billion of fixed rate senior notes that mature between 2023 and 2026. We used the net proceeds of these note issuances to repay the
$13.8 billion outstanding under our two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement. In 2021, we also repaid $1.5 billion of term notes. As a result,
our cash and short-term investment balance was $16.2 billion and our debt balance was $58.1 billion at December 31, 2021. In addition, we have
term notes of $1.2 billion maturing in 2022.

As of December 31, 2021, our unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit agreements is $14.7 billion. We anticipate that these revolving credit
lines will remain undrawn and primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Our borrowing capacity includes
a $3.1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which is set to expire in October 2022. See Note 15.

In  2021,  our  short-term  and  long-term  credit  ratings  by  the  major  credit  rating  agencies  remained  unchanged  from  2020.  There  is  risk  for  further
downgrades.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, trade payables included $2.3 billion and $3.8 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply
chain  financing  programs.  While  access  to  supply  chain  financing  has  been  reduced  due  to  our  current  credit  ratings  and  debt  levels,  we  do  not
believe that these or future changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.

In addition to our debt issuances, we have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. During 2020, our Board of Directors terminated its prior
authorization to repurchase shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock and suspended the declaration and/or payment of dividends until
further

notice. We have also reduced production rates in our commercial business to reflect the impact of COVID-19 on the industry. We rationalized our
workforce  through  a  combination  of  voluntary  and  involuntary  layoffs  and  natural  turnover.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  we  began  using  our
common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans. In December 2020, we awarded most of our employees a one-time
stock  grant  that  will  vest  in  three  years  in  lieu  of  merit  pay  increases.  We  have  reduced  discretionary  spending,  including  reducing  or  deferring
research and development and capital expenditures. We expect these actions to further enable the Company to conserve cash.

We are also working with our customers and supply chain to accelerate receipts and conserve cash. For example, the United States Department of
Defense  (U.S.  DoD)  has  taken  steps  to  work  with  its  industry  partners  to  increase  liquidity  in  the  form  of  increased  progress  payment  rates  and
reductions in withholds among other initiatives. In addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act included a five-year net
operating loss carryback provision which enabled us to benefit from certain 2020 losses and resulted in tax refunds of $1.7 billion in 2021.

We  continue  to  transform  and  improve  our  business  processes.  These  activities  are  not  intended  to  constrain  our  capacity  but  to  enable  the
Company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers.

Based  on  our  current  best  estimates  of  market  demand,  planned  production  rates,  timing  of  cash  receipts  and  expenditures,  our  ability  to
successfully implement further actions to improve liquidity as well as our ability to access additional liquidity, if needed, we believe it is probable that
we will be able to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  requires  management  to  make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the accounting estimates
and assumptions are appropriate, however, given the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic actual results could differ from those estimates.

Operating Cycle

For  classification  of  certain  current  assets  and  liabilities,  we  use  the  duration  of  the  related  contract  or  program  as  our  operating  cycle,  which  is
generally longer than one year.

Revenue and Related Cost Recognition

Commercial  aircraft  contracts  The  majority  of  our  BCA  segment  revenue  is  derived  from  commercial  aircraft  contracts.  For  each  contract,  we
determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft
performance  obligation  based  on  relative  standalone  selling  prices  adjusted  by  an  escalation  formula  as  specified  in  the  customer  agreement.
Revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the
customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.

In  certain  situations,  where  an  aircraft  is  still  in  our  possession,  and  title  and  risk  of  loss  has  passed  to  the  customer  (known  as  a  bill-and-hold
arrangement), revenue will be recognized when all specific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met.

Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit upon order and
additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances and
progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  are  normal  and  customary  for  commercial  aircraft  contracts  and  not  considered  a  significant  financing
component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.

Long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other
customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurity
products,  surveillance  suites,  advanced  weapons,  missile  defense,  military  derivative  aircraft,  satellite  systems  and  modification  of  commercial
passenger aircraft to cargo freighters. Services sales under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated
with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.

For each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction
price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone
selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated
nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-
term  contracts  may  be  modified  over  their  life,  the  transaction  price  is  based  on  current  rights  and  obligations  under  the  contract  and  does  not
include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for
the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs
incurred  plus  an  agreed  upon  profit.  The  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  in
establishing  the  price  for  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  Certain  long-term  contracts  include  in  the  transaction  price  variable  consideration,
such as incentive  and award  fees,  if specified  targets  are achieved.  The amount  included in the transaction  price represents  the expected  value,
based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.

Long-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as services
are  rendered.  We  generally  recognize  revenue  over  time  as  we  perform  on  long-term  contracts  because  of  continuous  transfer  of  control  to  the
customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the
customer  to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in
process.  Similarly,  for  non-U.S.  government  contracts,  the  customer  typically  controls  the  work  in  process  as  evidenced  either  by  contractual
termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not
have an alternative use to the Company.

The  accounting  for  long-term  contracts  involves  a  judgmental  process  of  estimating  total  sales,  costs  and  profit  for  each  performance  obligation.
Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to
the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales.  Recognizing  revenue  as  costs  are  incurred  provides  an  objective  measure  of  progress  on  the  long-term
contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.

For long-term contracts for which revenue is recognized over time, changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating
income  are  recognized  using  a  cumulative  catch-up  adjustment  which  recognizes  in  the  current  period  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  changes  on
current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of

66

Table of Contents

total sales and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract is recognized.

Net  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  to  prior  years'  revenue  and  earnings,  including  certain  reach-forward  losses,  across  all  long-term  contracts
were as follows:

Increase/(Decrease) to Revenue
Increase to Loss from operations
Decrease to Diluted EPS

2021

($379)
($880)
($1.28)

2020

($359)
($942)
($1.37)

2019

$54
($111)
($0.06)

Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2021 included losses on KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and VC-25B.

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance or circumstances
may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.

Payments  under  long-term  contracts  may  be  received  before  or  after  revenue  is  recognized.  The  U.S.  government  customer  typically  withholds
payment  of  a  small  portion  of  the  contract  price  until  contract  completion.  Therefore,  long-term  contracts  typically  generate  Unbilled  receivables
(contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances and
progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company in
the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.

Commercial  spare  parts  contracts Certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  include  sales  of  commercial  spare  parts.  For  each  contract,  we
determine the transaction  price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair
value.  We  generally  consider  each  spare  part  to  be  a  separate  performance  obligation.  Revenue  is  recognized  for  each  commercial  spare  part
performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare part
where  a  customer  may  receive  a  full  or  partial  refund,  a  credit  applied  to  amounts  owed,  a  different  product  in  exchange,  or  any  combination  of
these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at
average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.

Other service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance,
training, data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the services
are rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts the
transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.

Concession  Sharing  Arrangements We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  and
services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessions
incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements,
which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.

Unbilled Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenue
for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the

67

Table of Contents

contract  with  the  customer.  Advances  and  progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  arise  when  the  Company  receives  payments  from  customers  in
advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract.

Financial Services Revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases and loans in Sales
of  services  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations.  For  sales-type  leases,  we  recognize  revenue  if  collection  of  the  lease  payments  is
probable.  For  sales-type  and  finance  leases,  we  record  customer  financing  receivables  at  lease  inception.  A  customer  financing  receivable  is
recorded  at  the  aggregate  of  future  minimum  lease  payments,  estimated  residual  value  of  the  leased  equipment,  and  any  deferred  incremental
direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. For
notes  receivable,  notes  are  recorded  as  customer  financing  receivables  net  of  any  unamortized  discounts  and  deferred  incremental  direct  costs.
Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.

Income  recognition  is  generally  suspended  for  customer  financing  receivables  that  are  uncollectible.  We  determine  that  a  customer  financing
receivable is uncollectible when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to
the  original  contractual  terms.  We  determine  a  customer  financing  receivable  is  past  due  when  cash  has  not  been  received  upon  the  due  date
specified in the contract.

We evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. If a customer financing receivable is
determined  to  be  uncollectible,  the  customer  is  categorized  as  non-accrual  status.  When  a  customer  is  in  non-accrual  status  at  commencement,
sales-type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. If we have a
direct finance lease and/or a note receivable with a customer that is in non-accrual status, or a sales-type lease with a customer that changes to
non-accrual  status  after  commencement,  we  recognize  contractual  interest  income  as  payments  are  received  to  the  extent  there  is  sufficient
collateral and payments exceed past due principal payments.

Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of
the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-
than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.

For  operating  leases,  revenue  on  leased  aircraft  and  equipment  is  recorded  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  lease.  Operating  lease
assets, included in Customer financing, net, are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight-line method over
the  period  that  we  project  we  will  hold  the  asset.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  by
prospectively adjusting depreciation expense.

Reinsurance  Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  The
member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $126,
$129  and  $151  during  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  Reinsurance  costs  related  to  premiums  and  claims  paid  to  the  reinsurance  pool  were
$129,  $136  and  $150  during  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  Revenues  and  costs  are  presented  net  in  Cost  of  sales  in  the  Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Fleet Support

We  provide  assistance  and  support  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.
Collectively known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering
support, and

68

Table of Contents

technical  data  and  documents.  Fleet  support  activity  begins  prior  to  aircraft  delivery  as  the  customer  receives  training,  manuals,  and  technical
consulting  support.  This  activity  continues  throughout  the  aircraft’s  operational  life.  Services  provided  after  delivery  include  field  service  support,
consulting on maintenance, repair and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and
the  issuance  of  service  bulletins  that  impact  the  entire  model’s  fleet.  Field  service  support  involves  our  personnel  located  at  customer  facilities
providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.

Research and Development

Research  and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  to
government  products  and  services,  which  are  expensed  as  incurred  unless  the  costs  are  related  to  certain  contractual  arrangements  with
customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent
with our long-term contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts
research  and  development  accounting.  Accordingly,  the  amounts  funded  by  the  customer  are  recognized  as  an  offset  to  our  research  and
development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $213, $224 and
$214 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation

We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based
on  the  grant-date  fair  value  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  For  awards  settled  in  cash,  or  that  may  be  settled  in  cash,  we  measure  compensation
expense based on the fair value at each reporting  date  net of estimated  forfeitures.  The expense is recognized over the requisite  service period,
which is generally the vesting period of the award.

Income Taxes

Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Loss before income taxes based on current tax
law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax
assets  and  liabilities.  Such  provisions  differ  from  the  amounts  currently  receivable  or  payable  because  certain  items  of  income  and  expense  are
recognized in different  time periods for financial reporting  purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining
income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.

The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  We  record  a  liability  for  the  difference  between  the  benefit  recognized  and  measured  for
financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax
positions  changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  are
classified as a component of Income tax benefit.

We  also  assess  the  likelihood  that  we  will  be  able  to  recover  our  deferred  tax  assets  against  future  sources  of  taxable  income  and  reduce  the
carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of such assets will not be realized. Changes in our estimates  and judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets may result in an
increase or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensive income, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.

Postretirement Plans

Many  of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union
employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. We also provide postretirement
benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the
pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits
are  also  based  on  the  employee’s  annual  earnings.  The  net  periodic  cost  of  our  pension  and  other  postretirement  plans  is  determined  using  the
projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return
and  medical  trend  (rate  of  growth  for  medical  costs).  A  portion  of  the  service  cost  component  of  net  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirement
income  or  expense  is  not  recognized  in  net  earnings  in  the  year  incurred  because  it  is  allocated  to  production  as  product  costs  and  reflected  in
inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are
reflected in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we
amortize them over the average expected future lifetime of participants. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on
the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Postemployment Plans

We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,
and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.

Environmental Remediation

We  are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  and
remediation  of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,
obligations  and  commitments  for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recoveries  from  other
responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental
remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is
based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred.
Estimated  remediation  costs  are not discounted  to present value as the timing of payments  cannot be reasonably  estimated.  We may be able to
recover  a  portion  of  the  remediation  costs  from  insurers  or  other  third  parties.  Such  recoveries  are  recorded  when  realization  of  the  claim  for
recovery is deemed probable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  highly  liquid  instruments,  such  as  commercial  paper,  time  deposits,  and  other  money  market  instruments,
which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and
reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable
were $47 and $74 at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Inventories

Inventoried  costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-
recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe

70

Table of Contents

benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent
a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they
are  expensed  in  the  current  period  rather  than  inventoried.  Inventoried  costs  include  amounts  relating  to  programs  and  contracts  with  long-term
production  cycles,  a  portion  of  which  is  not  expected  to  be  realized  within  one  year.  Included  in  inventory  for  federal  government  contracts  is  an
allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.

Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs
incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs
are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor
and  other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  these
deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is
below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from
suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process.

The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete
all  contract  requirements.  When  actual  contract  costs  and  the  estimate  to  complete  exceed  total  estimated  contract  revenues,  a  loss  provision  is
recorded.  The  determination  of  net  realizable  value  of  commercial  aircraft  program  costs  is  based  upon  quarterly  program  reviews  that  estimate
revenue  and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  program
revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.

Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.
See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost
or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess
or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired
inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.

Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that
are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the
aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the
ability  to  recover  amounts  paid.  However,  to  the  extent  early  issue  sales  consideration  exceeds  advances  and  is  not  considered  to  be  otherwise
recoverable, it would be written off in the current period.

Precontract Costs

We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery
from  future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalized
precontract  costs  are  included  in  Inventories  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Should  future  orders  not
materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.

71

Table of Contents

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  are
depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and
equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and
machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years’ digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight
line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over the term of
the hosting arrangement, which is typically no greater than 10 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives
assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Long-lived  assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  an
impairment  assessment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  If  the  carrying
value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between
the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Leases We  determine  if  an  arrangement  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  at  the  inception  date.  Operating  leases  are  included  in  Other  assets,  with  the
related  liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under  finance  leases,  which  primarily  represent  computer
equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term
debt and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease
payments  arising  from  the  lease.  Operating  lease  assets  and liabilities  are  recognized  at  the  lease  commencement  date  based  on the  estimated
present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease
payments.  Variable  components  of  the  lease  payments  such  as  fair  market  value  adjustments,  utilities  and  maintenance  costs  are  expensed  as
incurred and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably
certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We have real property lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,
asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.

We  also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  be
performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.
Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in
the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’s
fair  value.  In  addition,  there  may  be  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations  that  we  have  not  yet  discovered  (e.g.  asbestos  may  exist  in  certain
buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of

72

Table of Contents

business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles

Goodwill  and  other  acquired  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  lives  are  not  amortized,  but  are  tested  for  impairment  annually  and  when  an  event
occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.

We  test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  quantitative  test.  If  we  choose  to  perform  a  qualitative
assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the
quantitative  test  is  then  performed;  otherwise,  no  further  testing  is  required.  For  operations  where  the  quantitative  test  is  used,  we  compare  the
carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the
shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.

Indefinite-lived  intangibles  consist  of  a  brand  and  trade  name  and  in-process  research  and  development  (IPR&D)  acquired  in  business
combinations. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. IPR&D
is  reclassified  to  finite-lived  acquired  intangible  assets  when  a  project  is  completed  and  then  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  asset’s
estimated  useful life. We test these intangibles for impairment  by comparing the carrying values to current projections  of related discounted cash
flows. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.

Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,
from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from
1 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of
the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Investments

Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.

Available-for-sale  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  U.S.  government  agency  securities  and  corporate  debt  securities.  Available-for-sale
debt  securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded,  net  of  tax,  as  a  component  of  accumulated  other
comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method.
Available-for-sale debt securities are assessed for impairment quarterly.

The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,
over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between
20% and 50%. The cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.

Other  Equity  investments  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recorded  through  net  earnings.  Equity  investments  without  readily
determinable  fair  value  are  measured  at  cost,  less  impairments,  plus  or  minus  observable  price  changes.  Equity  investments  without  readily
determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.

Table of Contents

We  classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-
operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including
our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on
the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-
strategic  purposes.  Earnings  from  non-operating  investments,  including  interest  and  dividends  on  marketable  securities,  and  any  impairments  or
gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net.

Derivatives

All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.
We  use  derivative  instruments  to  principally  manage  a  variety  of  market  risks.  For  our  cash  flow  hedges,  the  derivative’s  gain  or  loss  is  initially
reported  in  comprehensive  income  and  is  subsequently  reclassified  into  earnings  in  the  same  period(s)  during  which  the  hedged  forecasted
transaction affects earnings. We have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and non-U.S.
business requirements. These agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We also
hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For these aluminum agreements
and  for  other  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment,  the  changes  in  their  fair  value  are  recorded  in  earnings
immediately.

Allowances for Losses on Certain Financial Assets

We establish allowances for credit losses on accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, customer  financing receivables and certain other financial
assets. The adequacy of these allowances is assessed quarterly through consideration of factors such as customer credit ratings, bankruptcy filings,
published or estimated credit default rates, age of the receivable, expected loss rates and collateral exposures. We determine the creditworthiness
of our customers by assigning internal credit ratings based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from the customers.
Our rating categories are comparable to those used by major credit rating agencies.

Aircraft Valuation

Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for
the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used
aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain
customers  wherein  we  agree  to  repurchase  the  Sale  Aircraft  at  a  specified  price,  generally  10  to  15  years  after  delivery  of  the  Sale  Aircraft.  Our
repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an
agreement  for  the  sale  of  additional  new  aircraft,  and  if  the  customer  exercises  its  right  to  sell  the  Sale  Aircraft  to  us,  a  contingent  repurchase
commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-
in commitments.

74

Table of Contents

Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:

(1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the
fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or

(2) charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitive
agreement  for  Sale  Aircraft  but  prior  to  the  purchase  of  the  used  trade-in  aircraft.  Estimates  based  on  current  aircraft  values  would  be
included in Accrued liabilities.

The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft
and  similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  most
instances begins years before the return  of the aircraft.  There are several possible markets  in which we continually pursue opportunities to place
used  aircraft.  These  markets  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  resale  market,  which  could  potentially  include  the  cost  of  long-term  storage;  the
leasing  market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraft
valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation
analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party  aircraft valuations
based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.

Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent
to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets
are included in Customer financing.

Customer financing Customer  financing  includes operating  lease equipment,  notes  receivable  and sales-type/finance  leases.  Sales-type/finance
leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary. Customer financing is collateralized by security in the
related asset.

We assess the fair value of equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables to determine if
their fair values are less than the related customer financing assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-
type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on
receivables.

We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the
aircraft  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  aircraft.  Under  certain  circumstances,  we  apply  judgment  based  on  the  attributes  of  the  specific  aircraft  or
equipment,  usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outside
publications.

Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or
assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be
less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how
long  we  will  hold  an  asset  subject  to  operating  lease  before  it  is  sold,  the  expected  future  lease  rates,  lease  terms,  residual  value  of  the  asset,
periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining

75

Table of Contents

economic life of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over
the fair value of the asset.

Allowance  for  losses  on  customer  financing  receivables We  record  the  estimated  allowance  for  potential  losses  on  customer  financing
receivables in a valuation account. The four primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are
collateral values, internal customer credit ratings, default rates and expected loss rate.

We  review  the  adequacy  of  the  allowance  for  losses  by  assessing  the  collateral  exposure,  the  applicable  default  rate  and  expected  loss  rate.
Collateral  exposure  for  a  particular  receivable  is  the  excess  of  the  carrying  value  of  the  receivable  over  the  fair  value  of  the  related  collateral.  A
receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable default rate is
determined using two components: internal customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. We assign internal credit ratings
for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly
from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. We apply an expected loss rate, based
on publicly available information, to the applicable default rate.

We have entered  into agreements  with certain  customers  that  would entitle  us to look beyond the specific  collateral underlying  the receivable  for
purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting
from  a  default  condition  be  insufficient  to  cover  the  carrying  value  of  our  receivable  (creating  a  shortfall  condition),  these  agreements  would,  for
example,  permit  us  to  take  the  actions  necessary  to  sell  or  retain  certain  other  assets  in  which  the  customer  has  an  equity  interest  and  use  the
proceeds to cover the shortfall.

Each  quarter  we  review  the  assigned  internal  customer  credit  ratings,  published  historical  credit  default  rates  for  different  rating  categories  and
multiple  third-party  aircraft  value  publications  as  a  basis  to  validate  the  reasonableness  of  the  allowance  for  losses  on  customer  financing
receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not
result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables.

Warranties

In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our BCA segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year standard
warranty  for  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and  software  manufactured  by  us  or  manufactured  to  certain  standards  under  our
authorization.  These  warranties  are  included  in  the  programs’  estimate  at  completion.  On  occasion  we  have  made  commitments  beyond  the
standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties
issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft  and weapons systems.  These sales are generally accompanied by a six
month  to  two-year  warranty  period  and  cover  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts  and  software  manufactured  by  us  to  certain  contractual
specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warranty
liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times
the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for

76

Table of Contents

certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the
initial liability estimate.

We  provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraft
performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known
and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,
and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of
the  related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  supplied
equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a
reduction  in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  the
programs’ estimate at completion.

Supplier Penalties

We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is
reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.

Guarantees

We  record  a  liability  in  Accrued  liabilities  for  the  fair  value  of  guarantees.  For  credit  guarantees,  the  liability  is  equal  to  the  present  value  of  the
expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor’s default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery,
if applicable. At inception of a guarantee, and adjusted each quarter, we also recognize a liability for the expected contingent loss.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings
per  share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participating
securities as if all earnings had been distributed  during the period. Participating  securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed
earnings.

Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weighted
average common shares outstanding.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities,  divided by the diluted weighted
average common shares outstanding.

    On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted, which includes a five year net operating loss (NOL) carryback provision which enabled us to
benefit from the 2020 U.S. federal tax NOL at the former federal tax rate of 35%. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded tax expense of $3 and tax
benefits of $1,175 related to the NOL carryback provision.

    In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $6, $82 and $180, respectively.
    In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $587 related to the settlement of the 2015-2017 federal tax audit. In the fourth quarter

The Company’s deferred income tax assets of $11,258 can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. The
Company’s deferred income tax liabilities of $8,976 will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years
and  increase  income  taxes  payable.  Tax  law  determines  whether  future  reversals  of  temporary  differences  will  result  in  taxable  and  deductible
amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally
are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities
relate primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions. From a U.S. federal tax perspective, the Company generated a tax NOL in 2020 that was
carried back to prior years when the tax rate was 35% due to the CARES Act benefit as described above. The Company generated tax NOL and
interest  carryovers  in  2021  that  can  be  carried  forward  indefinitely  and  federal  research  and  development  credits  that  can  be  carried  forward  20
years.

In the fourth quarter of 2020 and throughout 2021, the Company was in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. We also normalized earnings
and  other  comprehensive  income  (OCI)  for  certain  non-recurring  items  and  reached  a  normalized  three-year  cumulative  loss  position  in  2021.
Adjustments  to  normalize  earnings  included  non-recurring  items  for  certain  737  MAX  expenses,  an  agreement  with  the  Department  of  Justice,
severance costs and remeasurement gains and losses from the annual

82

Table of Contents

remeasurement  of  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations.  For  purposes  of  assessing  the  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets,  the
Company determined that it could not include future projected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has recorded valuation allowances of $2,423 and $3,094 primarily for certain federal deferred tax
assets, as well as for certain federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. To measure the valuation allowance, the Company
estimated in what year each of its deferred tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to estimate the reversal
patterns. Based on these methods, deferred tax liabilities are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next 5 to 10 years while
deferred tax assets related to pension and other postretirement  benefit obligations are assumed to reverse and generate tax deductions over the
next 15 to 20 years. The valuation allowance primarily results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversals in the appropriate
future periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets.

During 2021, the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $671. This reflects a tax benefit of $1,206 included in OCI primarily due to the net
actuarial  gains  that  resulted  from  the  annual  remeasurement  of  pension  assets  and  liabilities.  This  was  partially  offset  by  tax  expense  of  $512
recorded in continuing operations and an increase of $23 related to the associated federal benefit of state impacts.

Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse
impacts on earnings and/or OCI.

The  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (TCJA)  one-time  repatriation  tax  and  Global  Intangible  Low  Tax  Income  liabilities  effectively  taxed  the  undistributed
earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain
non-U.S.  subsidiaries  because  such  earnings  are  considered  to  be  indefinitely  reinvested.  If  such  earnings  were  to  be  distributed,  any  deferred
income taxes would not be significant.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated
Statements  of  Financial  Position  were  not  significant.  The  amounts  of  interest  included  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  were  not
significant for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2021, these amounts are primarily associated with the amount of research tax credits
claimed and various other matters.

Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2018. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began the 2018-2019 federal tax audit in
the  first  quarter  of  2021  and  recently  added  tax  year  2020  to  the  audit.  We  are  also  subject  to  examination  in  major  state  and  international
jurisdictions for the 2008-2020 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all
open years.

$733 at December 31, 2020 primarily related to KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew. See Note 13.

Commercial Aircraft Programs

The decrease in commercial aircraft programs inventory during 2021 reflects lower 737 MAX inventory due to resumption of deliveries and a reach-
forward loss on the 787 program. These decreases were partially offset by a continued buildup of 787 aircraft, as well as growth in 777X inventory.
Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes approximately 335 737 MAX aircraft and 110 787 aircraft at December 31, 2021 as compared with
425 737 MAX aircraft and 80 787 aircraft at December 31, 2020.

A  number  of  customers  have  requested  to  defer  deliveries  or  to  cancel  orders.  We  are  currently  remarketing  certain  aircraft  and  may  have  to
remarket additional aircraft in future periods. If we are unable to successfully remarket the aircraft, determine further production rate reductions are
necessary, and/or contract the program accounting quantities, future earnings may be reduced and/or additional reach-forward losses may have to
be recorded.

At  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  the  following  amounts  related  to  the  737  program:  deferred
production costs of $1,296 and $2,159 and unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs of $617 and $480. At December 31, 2021, $1,906 of
737 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program
accounting quantity that have firm orders, and $7 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent
expected future orders.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 777X program: $3,363 and
$1,727 of work in process and $3,521 and $3,295 of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X program plus costs already included in 777X inventory
exceed estimated revenues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $6,493 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs.
As  a  result,  777X  deferred  production  costs  were  immaterial  at  December  31,  2020  and  remain  immaterial  at  December  31,  2021.  The  level  of
profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-
19  on  our  production  system  as  well  as  impacts  on  our  supply  chain  and  customers,  further  production  rate  adjustments  for  the  777X  or  other
commercial aircraft programs, any contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of
aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.

During the fourth  quarter  of 2021, we determined  that estimated  costs  to complete  the 787 program  plus costs already included in 787 inventory
exceed estimated revenues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $3,460 was recorded as a reduction to deferred production costs.

December  31,  2021  and  2020,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  the  following  amounts  related  to  the  787  program:  deferred
production costs of $11,693 and $14,976, $1,907 and $1,865 of supplier advances, and $1,815 and $1,863 of unamortized tooling and other non-
recurring costs. At December 31, 2021, $9,024 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to
be  recovered  from  units  included  in  the  program  accounting  quantity  that  have  firm  orders,  and  $4,484  is  expected  to  be  recovered  from  units
included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders.

Commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  amounts  credited  in  cash  or  other  consideration  (early  issue  sales  consideration)  to  airline
customers totaling $3,290 and $2,992 at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Note 8 – Contracts with Customers

Unbilled receivables increased from $7,995 at December 31, 2020 to $8,620 at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by revenue recognized at BDS
and BGS in excess of billings.

Advances and progress billings increased from $50,488 at December 31, 2020 to $52,980 at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by advances on
orders received at BDS, BCA and BGS, partially offset by revenue recognized and the return of customer advances at BCA.

Revenues recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 from amounts recorded as Advances and progress billings at the beginning
of each year were $11,336 and $10,360.

In  2019,  following  two  fatal  737  MAX  accidents,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities  issued  orders
suspending commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft. Deliveries of the 737 MAX were suspended following these orders. Deliveries in the U.S.
resumed in late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding order. In addition, several other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities, including the
Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency, Transport Canada, and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency have subsequently approved return of
operations, allowing us to resume deliveries in those jurisdictions. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an airworthiness directive in the
fourth quarter of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to China to resume in 2022, subject
to final regulatory approvals, although risk remains around the timing and rate of those deliveries. Over 185 countries have approved the resumption
of 737 MAX operations. The 737 MAX remains grounded in a small number of non-U.S. jurisdictions.

We have gradually increased production rates in 2020 and 2021 and continue to expect to increase the production rate to 31 per month by early
2022, as well as implement further gradual production rate increases in subsequent periods based on market demand and supply chain capacity.

We produced at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021 and expensed abnormal production costs of $1,887 and $2,567 during the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We do not expect the remaining abnormal costs related to the 737 MAX to be significant and expect most of
the remainder to be incurred in early 2022.

In 2021, we delivered 245 aircraft. We have approximately 335 airplanes in inventory as of December 31, 2021 and we anticipate delivering most of
these  aircraft  by  the  end  of  2023.  We  continue  to  work  with  customers  who  have  requested  to  defer  deliveries  or  to  cancel  orders  for  737  MAX
aircraft, and we are remarketing and/or delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. In the event that we are unable to resume
aircraft  deliveries  in  China  and/or  ramp  up  deliveries  consistent  with  our  assumptions,  our  expectation  of  delivery  timing  and  our  expectation
regarding future gradual production rate increases could be impacted.

We have also recorded additional expenses of $175, $416, and $328 due to the 737 MAX grounding during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The

The  liabilities  recorded  represent  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  costs  expected  to  be  incurred  to  remediate
sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these
recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the
discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that
includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our
experience  and  existing  laws  and  regulations.  There  are  some  potential  remediation  obligations  where  the  costs  of  remediation  cannot  be
reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our
recorded liabilities by $1,094 and 1,095.

The increase in the product warranty reserve during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily driven by charges related to “pickle forks” on
737NG  aircraft.  During  2019,  we  detected  cracks  in  the  "pickle  forks",  a  frame  fitting  component  of  the  structure  connecting  the  wings  to  the
fuselages  of  737NG  aircraft.  We  notified  the  FAA,  which  issued  a  directive  requiring  that  certain  737NG  airplanes  be  inspected.  In  2019,  we
estimated  the  number  of  aircraft  that  would  have  to  be  repaired  in  the  future  and  provisioned  for  the  estimated  costs  of  completing  the  repairs.
During  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  recognized  charges  of  $336  based  on  revised  engineering  and  fleet  utilization  estimates  as  well  as  updated
repair cost estimates. We cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, in excess of amounts recognized due to the ongoing nature
of the inspections and repairs and pending the completion of investigations into the cause of the condition.

Commercial Aircraft Commitments

In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain
customers  that  give  them  the  right  to  trade  in  used  aircraft  at  a  specified  price  upon  the  purchase  of  Sale  Aircraft.  The  probability  that  trade-in
commitments  will  be exercised  is determined  by  using  both  quantitative  information  from  valuation  sources  and qualitative  information  from  other
sources.  The  probability  of  exercise  is  assessed  quarterly,  or  as  events  trigger  a  change,  and  takes  into  consideration  the  current  economic  and
airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during
the period specified in the agreement and require advance notice by the customer.

Trade-in  commitment  agreements  at  December  31,  2021  have  expiration  dates  from  2022  through  2028.  At  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  total
contractual  trade-in  commitments  were  $612  and  $950.  As  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  we  estimated  that  it  was  probable  we  would  be
obligated  to  perform  on  certain  of  these  commitments  with  net  amounts  payable  to  customers  totaling  $283  and  $599,  and  the  fair  value  of  the
related trade-in aircraft was $283 and $580.

Financing Commitments

Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft,
totaled  $12,905  and  $11,512  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020.  The  estimated  earliest  potential  funding  dates  for  these  commitments  as  of
December 31, 2021 are as follows:

$12,905

As  of  December  31,  2021,  all  of  these  financing  commitments  relate  to  customers  we  believe  have  less  than  investment-grade  credit.  We  have
concluded that  no reserve  for  future  potential  losses  is required  for  these  financing  commitments  based upon the terms,  such as collateralization
and interest rates, under which funding would be provided.

Funding Commitments

We have commitments to make additional capital contributions of $248 to joint ventures over the next six years.

Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds

We  have  entered  into  standby  letters  of  credit  and  surety  bonds  with  financial  institutions  primarily  relating  to  the  guarantee  of  our  future
performance  on  certain  contracts.  Contingent  liabilities  on  outstanding  letters  of  credit  agreements  and  surety  bonds  aggregated  approximately
$3,634 and $4,238 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Company Owned Life Insurance

McDonnell Douglas Corporation  insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance  (COLI),  which are life insurance policies with a cash
surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this
time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the
cash  surrender  value  was  $374  and  $395  and  the  total  loans  were  $360  and  $382.  As  we  have  the  right  to  offset  the  loans  against  the  cash
surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31,
2021 and 2020.

BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts

We  have  recorded  earnings  charges  for  losses  on  a  number  of  fixed-price  development  contracts.  Fixed-price  development  work  is  inherently
uncertain  and  subject  to  significant  variability  in  estimates  of  the  cost  and  time  required  to  complete  the  work.  The  operational  and  technical
complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger additional earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations or
other financially significant exposure.

KC-46A Tanker

In  2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next  generation  aerial
refueling  tankers.  This  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and  Development  (EMD)  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  and  involves  highly
complex designs and systems integration. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized seven low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 94 aircraft.
The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots are valued at approximately $19 billion as of December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $243 of capitalized precontract costs and $409 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers.

Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts

Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands
related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve
for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily  resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide
refunds to the U.S. government.

Severance

During 2020, the Company recorded severance costs for approximately 26,000 employees expected to leave the Company through a combination
of voluntary and involuntary terminations. The severance packages are consistent with the Company’s ongoing compensation and benefits plans.
During the first quarter of 2021, we reduced the estimated number of employees expected to leave the Company through voluntary and involuntary
terminations to approximately 23,000. During the second quarter of 2021, we further reduced the estimated number of employees expected to leave
the  company  through  voluntary  and  involuntary  terminations  to  approximately  19,000.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  our  severance  liability  primarily
relates to remaining severance payments to terminated employees.

Note 14 – Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees.

The  following  table  provides  quantitative  data  regarding  our  third  party  guarantees.  The  maximum  potential  payments  represent  a  “worst-case
scenario” and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated

Contingent  Repurchase  Commitments The  commercial  aircraft  repurchase  price  specified  in  contingent  repurchase  commitments  is  generally
lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the
lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.

Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original
lessee  or  debtor  does  not  make  payments  or  perform  certain  specified  services.  Generally,  these  guarantees  have  been  extended  on  behalf  of
guaranteed  parties  with  less  than  investment-grade  credit  and  are  collateralized  by  certain  assets.  Current  outstanding  credit  guarantees  expire
through 2036.

Industrial Revenue Bonds Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of
real  and  personal  property  at  our  St.  Louis  site.  Tax  benefits  associated  with  IRBs  include  a  twelve-year  property  tax  abatement  and  sales  tax
exemption from St. Louis County. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have also purchased the
IRBs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB
assets are equal and are reported  net in the Consolidated Statements  of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assets and
liabilities associated with the IRBs were $271.

Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our
BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating
to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted
under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments
under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are
probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 13.

Note 15 – Debt

In the first quarter of 2021, we issued $9,825 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $1,325 due February 4, 2023 that bear an annual interest rate of
1.167%, $3,000 due February 4, 2024 that bear an annual interest rate of 1.433%, and $5,500 due February 4, 2026 that bear an annual interest
rate  of  2.196%.  The  notes  are  unsecured  senior  obligations  and  rank  equally  in  right  of  payment  with  our  existing  and  future  unsecured  and
unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $9,780, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering
expenses.  We  used  the  net  proceeds  of  these  note  issuances  to  repay  $9,825  outstanding  under  our  two-year  delayed  draw  term  loan  credit
agreement in the first quarter of 2021, and we repaid the remaining $4,000 in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Interest  incurred,  including  amounts  capitalized,  was  $2,790,  $2,280  and  $867  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,
respectively.  Interest  expense  recorded  by  BCC  is  reflected  as  Boeing  Capital  interest  expense  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations.
Total Company interest payments were $2,583, $1,925 and $973 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

In  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a  $5,280  two-year  revolving  credit  agreement.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  $14,740  currently
available  under  credit  line  agreements,  of  which  $3,060  is  a  364-day  revolving  credit  facility  expiring  in  October  2022,  $3,200  expires  in  October
2022, $5,280 expires in March 2023 and $3,200 expires in October 2024. The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us
to  extend  the  maturity  of  any  borrowings  one  year  beyond  the  aforementioned  expiration  date.  We  continue  to  be  in  full  compliance  with  all
covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements.

Many  of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union
employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.

We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants and are structured
to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future
benefit payments.

We  also  have  other  postretirement  benefits  (OPB)  other  than  pensions  which  consist  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  and
qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for
approximately three-fourths of those participants who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered
by most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the

99

Table of Contents

difference  between the plan assets  at fair value and the projected  benefit obligation  (PBO).  We have recognized  the aggregate  of all overfunded
plans in Other  assets and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree  health care or Accrued pension plan liability,  net. The
portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next
12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities.

The following assumptions, which are the weighted average for all plans, are used to calculate the benefit obligation at December 31 of each year
and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year.

The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality
bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields
developed  from  bonds  at  various  maturity  points.  Bonds  with  the  ten  percent  highest  and  the  ten  percent  lowest  yields  are  omitted.  The  present
value of each plan’s benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.

The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and
anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to historical returns, the assumption represents a
long-term,  prospective  return.  The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  component  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  cost  for  the  upcoming  plan  year  is
determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the
accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31,
2021, the MRVA was approximately $4,773 less than the fair market value of assets.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension
plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for
our  long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  total
investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class
are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.

We periodically  update our long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations.  We use various  analytics  to determine  the optimal  asset  mix  and consider  plan
liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of our
strategy is to de-risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2021, as the funded status of the plans increased, certain assets
were  reallocated  to  fixed  income.  The  changes  in  the  asset  allocation  are  reflected  in  the  asset  allocation  table  below.  We  identify  investment
benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.
Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length
of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and
exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and
rebalanced frequently. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:

Fixed  income  securities  are invested  primarily  in a diversified  portfolio  of long duration  instruments  as well as Emerging  Market,  Structured,  High
Yield and Private Debt. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and
market capitalizations.

Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital,
growth and special situation strategies. Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through investments in a
limited partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real
estate). Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not
limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure.

Hedge  fund  investments  seek  to  capitalize  on  inefficiencies  identified  across  and  within  different  asset  classes  or  markets.  Hedge  fund  strategy
types include, but are not limited to, directional, event driven, relative value and long-short.

Investment  managers  are  retained  for  explicit  investment  roles  specified  by  contractual  investment  guidelines.  Certain  investment  managers  are
authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the
desired  market  exposure  of  a  security  or  an  index,  transfer  value-added  performance  between  asset  classes,  achieve  the  desired  currency
exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.

As  a  percentage  of  total  pension  assets,  derivative  net  notional  amounts  were  33.4%  and  8.3%  for  fixed  income,  including  to-be-announced
mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and (5.4%) and 0.4% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

In November 2020, the Company contributed $3,000 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage
and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. Plan assets included $1,883 and $3,298 of our common stock as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Risk Management In managing the pension assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk,
counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach
and  are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  by
investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored
regularly  through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counter
derivatives.  Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuation
processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation and periodic, security-specific valuation testing.

Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The fair
value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on
quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets.  Level  2  refers  to  fair  values  estimated  using  significant  other  observable  inputs  and  Level  3
includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Fixed  income  securities  are  primarily  valued  upon  a  market  approach,  using  matrix  pricing  and  considering  a  security’s  relationship  to  other
securities  for which quoted prices in an active market  may be available, or an income approach, converting  future  cash flows to a single present
value amount.

105

Table of Contents

Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields and base spreads.

Common/collective/pooled  funds  are  typically  common  or  collective  trusts  valued  at  their  net  asset  values  (NAVs)  that  are  calculated  by  the
investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are
primarily  valued  using  an  income  approach  with  inputs  that  include  benchmark  yields,  swap  curves,  cash  flow  analysis,  rating  agency  data  and
interdealer  broker  rates.  Exchange-traded  derivative  positions  are  reported  in  accordance  with  changes  in  daily  variation  margin  which  is  settled
daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.

Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled
fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily
using  a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  for
instruments  with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equity
securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.

Private  equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,
operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis
(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.

Real  estate  and  real  asset  NAVs  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,  discounted  future
cash flows,  independent appraisals and market  based comparable  data. For those investments  reported  on a one-quarter  lagged basis (primarily
LPs),  NAVs  are  adjusted  for  subsequent  cash  flows  and  significant  events.  Publicly  traded  REITs  and  infrastructure  stocks  are  valued  using  a
market  approach  based  on  quoted  market  prices  of  identical  instruments.  Exchange-traded  commodities  futures  positions  are  reported  in
accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.

Hedge  fund  NAVs  are  generally  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments.  This  is  primarily  done  by  applying  a  market  or  income
valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held.

Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner,
fund  manager  or  third  party  administrator.  Additionally,  some  investments  in  fixed  income  and  equity  are  made  via  commingled  vehicles  and  are
valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as the
practical expedient for the valuations.

OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and
40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a

107

Table of Contents

market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The expected rate of return on these assets does not have a
material effect on the net periodic benefit cost.

Cash Flows

Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as well as rules governing funding of
our non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3,000 in common stock to
the pension fund. We do not expect to make discretionary contributions to our pension plans in 2022.

Estimated  Future  Benefit  Payments The  table  below  reflects  the  total  pension  benefits  expected  to  be  paid  from  the  plans  or  from  our  assets,
including  both  our  share  of  the  benefit  cost  and  the  participants’  share  of  the  cost,  which  is  funded  by  participant  contributions.  OPB  payments
reflect our portion only.

Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors
and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required
by  ERISA,  and  then  any  surplus  will  be  used  to  fund  a  trust  to  continue  present  and  future  payments  under  the  postretirement  medical  and  life
insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs.

Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will be
entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.

Defined Contribution Plans

We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense
for these defined contribution plans was $1,268, $1,351 and $1,533 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Note 17 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements

Share-Based Compensation

Our  2003 Incentive  Stock  Plan, as  amended  and restated,  permits  awards  of incentive  and non-qualified  stock  options,  stock  appreciation  rights,
restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to
our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance
under the plan is 87,000,000.

Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent
there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy
these issuances during 2022.

On February 17, 2021, we granted 342,986 premium-priced stock options to our executive officers as part of our long-term incentive program. These
stock options have an exercise price equal to 120% of the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The stock options are scheduled to
vest  and  become  exercisable  three  years  after  the  grant  date  and  expire  ten  years  after  the  grant  date.  If  an  executive  terminates  employment
because of retirement, layoff, disability or death, the executive (or beneficiary) may receive some or all of their stock options depending on certain
age  and  service  conditions.  The  fair  value  of  the  stock  options  granted  was  $74.63  per  unit  and  was  estimated  using  a  Monte-Carlo  simulation
model  using  the  following  assumptions:  expected  life  6.6  years,  expected  volatility  37.8%,  risk  free  interest  rate  1.3%  and  no  expected  dividend
yield. During 2021, we also granted 148,322 stock options to certain executives to encourage retention or to award various achievements, of which
40,322 had an exercise price equal to 120% of the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant, and the remaining 108,000 had an exercise
price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. These stock options are scheduled to vest and become exercisable three years after the
grant date and expire ten years after the grant date. The grant date fair market value of these awards was not significant.

Options granted through January 2014 had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire 10 years
after the date of grant. These stock options vested over a period of three years and were fully vested as of December 31, 2017.

Restricted Stock Units

In February 2021, 2020 and 2019, we granted to our executives 980,077, 325,108 and 233,582 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-
term  incentive  program  with  grant  date  fair  values  of  $215.70,  $319.04  and  $428.22  per  unit,  respectively.  During  2021,  we  also  granted  47,430
RSUs as part of this long-term incentive program. The RSUs granted under this program will generally vest and settle in common stock (on a one-
for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability or death, the
employee (or beneficiary) may receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period or all of their stock
units depending on certain age and service conditions. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. These
RSUs are labeled executive long-term incentive program in the table below.

In December 2020, we granted to our employees (excluding executives and certain union-represented employees), a one-time grant of 5,163,425
RSUs with a grant date fair value of $233.00 per unit. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one
basis)  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date.  If  an  employee  terminates  employment  because  of  retirement,  layoff,  disability  or  death,  the
employee (or beneficiary) may receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases,
the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. These RSUs are labeled employee long-term incentive program in the table
below.

In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive programs, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention
or to reward various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below.

The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

Performance-Based  Restricted  Stock  Units  (PBRSUs)  are  stock  units  that  pay  out  based  on  the  Company’s  total  shareholder  return  (TSR)  as
compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant. The
PBRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of
the  grant  date.  If  an  executive  terminates  employment  because  of  retirement,  layoff,  disability  or  death,  the  employee  (or  beneficiary)  remains
eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service
period. In all other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.

In February 2020 and 2019, we granted to our executives 290,202 and 214,651 PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program. Compensation
expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair values were
estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield as the units
earn dividend equivalents.

Performance Awards

During 2020 and 2019, we granted Performance Awards to our executives, which are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term
financial  goals  at  the  end  of  a  three-year  period.  Each  unit  has  an  initial  value  of  $100 dollars.  The  amount  payable  at  the  end  of  the  three-year
performance  period  may  be  anywhere  from  $0  to  $200  dollars  per  unit  for  the  2019  Performance  Awards  and  $0  to  $150  dollars  for  2020
Performance  Awards,  depending  on  the  Company’s  performance  against  plan  for  a  three-year  period.  The  Compensation  Committee  has  the
discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on
the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.

The minimum payout amount is $0, and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2020 and 2019 Performance Awards is $253
and $323.

The  Company  has  deferred  compensation  plans  which  permit  certain  employees  and  executives  to  defer  a  portion  of  their  salary,  bonus,  certain
other incentive awards and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these amounts among 23 investment funds including a Boeing stock
unit account.

Total  expense  related  to  deferred  compensation  was  $126,  $93  and  $174  in  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2021  and
2020, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,703 and $1,718.

Note 18 – Shareholders’ Equity

On  December  17,  2018,  the  Board  approved  a  repurchase  plan  for  up  to  $20,000  of  common  stock.  In  March  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors
terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares under this plan.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No

Note 19 – Derivative Financial Instruments

Cash Flow Hedges

Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency
forward  contracts  to  manage  currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreign
currencies.  Our  foreign  currency  contracts  hedge  forecasted  transactions  through  2031.  We  use  commodity  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-price
purchase  commitments  and  swaps  to  hedge  against  potentially  unfavorable  price  changes  for  commodities  used  in  production.  Our  commodity
contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2029.

Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment

We  have  entered  into  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  and  non-U.S.  business
requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments

113

Table of Contents

for  accounting  purposes.  The  quantities  of  aluminum  in  these  agreements  offset  and are  priced  at  prevailing  market  prices.  We  also  hold certain
foreign currency forward contracts and commodity swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Notional Amounts and Fair Values

The  notional  amounts  and  fair  values  of  derivative  instruments  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position  as  of  December  31  were  as

Based  on  our  portfolio  of  cash  flow  hedges,  we  expect  to  reclassify  gains  of  $22  (pre-tax)  out  of  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  into
earnings during the next 12 months.

We  have derivative  instruments  with  credit-risk-related  contingent features.  For  foreign  exchange contracts  with  original maturities  of  at  least  five
years,  our  derivative  counterparties  could  require  settlement  if  we  default  on  our  five-year  credit  facility.  For  certain  commodity  contracts,  our
counterparties  could  require  collateral  posted  in  an  amount  determined  by  our  credit  ratings.  The  fair  value  of  foreign  exchange  and  commodity
contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2021 was $7. At December 31, 2021,
there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.

Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and
Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured
at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

Money  market  funds,  available-for-sale  debt  investments  and  equity  securities  are  valued  using  a  market  approach  based  on  the  quoted  market
prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments.

Derivatives include foreign currency and commodity contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based
on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income
approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.

Certain  assets  have  been  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  using  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3).  The  following  table
presents  the  nonrecurring  losses  recognized  for  the  years  ended  December  31  due  to  long-lived  asset  impairment,  and  the  fair  value  and  asset

Investments, Property, plant and equipment, Other assets and Acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on
the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired customer financing assets includes operating lease
equipment and investments in sales type-leases/finance leases and is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of
third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades
and  other  market  factors.  Management  reviews  the  publications  quarterly  to  assess  the  continued  appropriateness  and  consistency  with  market
trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the
features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net
sales price for the aircraft.

For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2021, the following table presents
the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets.

The range represents  the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft  subject to fair value measurement,  according to the third party

The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration
of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments.

The fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms
to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current
market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing
cost  derived  from  dealer  quotes  or  discounted  cash  flows.  The  fair  values  of  our  debt  classified  as  Level  3  are  based  on  discounted  cash  flow
models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to
estimate  the  fair  value  of  our  indemnifications  and  financing  commitments  because  the  amount  and  timing  of  those  arrangements  are  uncertain.
Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds,
Accounts receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as
reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The fair value of assets
and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).

Note 21 – Legal Proceedings

Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.

In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  various  U.S.  government  inquiries  and  investigations  from  which  civil,  criminal  or  administrative  proceedings  could
result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble
damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also
be  suspended  or  debarred  from  government  contracts,  or  lose  its  export  privileges,  based  on  the  results  of  investigations.  Except  as  described
below, we believe,

117

Table of Contents

based  upon  current  information,  that  the  outcome  of  any  such  legal  proceeding,  claim,  or  government  dispute  and  investigation  will  not  have  a
material effect  on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of
recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in
excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.

Multiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accident
of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we entered into a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative
lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237,
before attorneys’ fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental
and regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX. Among these is an ongoing investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the outcome of which may be material. Other than with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department
of  Justice  entered  in  2021,  we  cannot  reasonably  estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the
current status of the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.

On  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that  resolves  the  Department  of
Justice’s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under
the  terms  of  the  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement,  we  agreed  to  the  filing  of  a  criminal  information  charging  the  Company  with  one  count  of
conspiracy  to  defraud  the  United  States,  based  on  the  conduct  of  two  former  737  MAX  program  technical  pilots;  the  criminal  information  will  be
dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that
we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or
beneficiaries  of  those  who  died  in  the  Lion  Air  Flight  610  and  Ethiopian  Airlines  Flight  302  accidents;  and  (c)  $1,770  to  the  Company’s  airline
customers  for  harm  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  grounding  of  the  737  MAX,  offset  in  part  by  payments  already  made  and  the  remainder  satisfied
through  payments  to  be  made  prior  to  the  termination  of  the  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement.  The  agreement  also  requires  that  we  review  our
compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal
controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms
of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established
to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries  of the victims  of the 737 MAX accidents.  In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company’s airline
customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.

During 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and services
operations of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and
develop  new  markets  for  the  C-390  Millennium.  In  2020,  we  exercised  our  contractual  right  to  terminate  these  agreements  based  on  Embraer’s
failure  to  meet  certain  required  closing  conditions.  Embraer  has  disputed  our  right  to  terminate  the  agreements,  and  the  dispute  is  currently  in
arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.

Note 22 – Segment and Revenue Information

Our  primary  profitability  measurements  to  review  a  segment’s  operating  results  are  Earnings/(loss)  from  operations  and  operating  margins.  We
operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.

118

Table of Contents

All  other  activities  fall  within  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other.  See  page  63 for  the  Summary  of  Business  Segment  Data,  which  is  an
integral part of this note.

BCA  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  principally  to  the  commercial  airline  industry  worldwide.  Revenue  on  commercial
aircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer.

BDS  engages  in  the  research,  development,  production  and  modification  of  the  following  products  and  related  services:  manned  and  unmanned
military  aircraft  and  weapons  systems,  surveillance  and  engagement,  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  satellite  systems  and  space
exploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.

BGS  provides  parts,  maintenance,  modifications,  logistics  support,  training,  data  analytics  and  information-based  services  to  commercial  and
government customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue on
commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts is
generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.

BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our customers.

While our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors  are located in Europe and
Japan. Revenues, including foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and consisted of the following:

represented  49%,  51%  and  39%  of  consolidated  revenues  for  2021,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  Approximately  4%  of  operating  assets  were
located outside the United States as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The following tables present BCA, BDS and BGS revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated in a number of ways, such as geographic
location, contract type and the method of revenue recognition. We believe these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our
revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Earnings in Equity Method Investments

Our share of income or loss from equity method investments was $40, $86 and $90, primarily in our BDS segment, for the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Backlog

Our total backlog includes contracts that we and our customers are committed to perform. The value in backlog represents the estimated transaction
prices on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed. Backlog is converted into revenue, primarily based on
the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable revenue recognition model.

Our backlog at December 31, 2021 was $377,499. We expect approximately 17% to be converted to revenue through 2022 and approximately 74%
through 2025, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue due to
787 production issues and associated rework, timing of 737 MAX delivery resumption in China, timing of entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7
and/or 737 MAX 10, and COVID-19 impacts.

Pension costs, comprising GAAP service and prior service costs, are allocated to BCA and the commercial operations at BGS. Pension costs are
allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers using U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ
different  actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. These costs are allocable to government contracts.  Other postretirement
benefit  costs  are  allocated  to  business  segments  based  on  CAS,  which  is  generally  based  on  benefits  paid.  FAS/CAS  service  cost  adjustment
represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and
costs  allocated  to  the  business  segments.  Non-operating  pension  and  postretirement  expenses  represent  the  components  of  net  periodic  benefit
costs other than service cost. These expenses are included in Other income, net.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results
of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2021,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2021,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated
Framework (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  January  31,  2022,
expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's
financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  PCAOB  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion  on  the  financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts – Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

As  more  fully  described  in  Notes  1  and  13  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  over  time  for  long-term
contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue
is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involves
estimating  the costs  to complete  production  of goods or rendering of services  and comparing  those costs  to the estimated  final revenue  amount.
Fixed-price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts
are  subject  to  significant  variability.  Due  to  the  technical  performance  requirements  in  many  of  these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  and  revenue
estimates could occur, resulting in lower margins or material reach-forward losses.

Given the complexity of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United
States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments
necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and
required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential
Aircraft fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:

• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its estimates.

• We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key cost and schedule
estimates, including the range and probability of reasonable outcomes, and the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates.

• We performed inquiries of the Company’s project managers and others directly involved with the contracts to evaluate management’s ability
to achieve the key cost and schedule estimates, as well as evaluate project status and project challenges which may affect total estimated
costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project.

• We  tested  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  key  data  used  in  developing  estimates.  We  developed  independent  expectations  of

reasonable outcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared our expectations to management’s estimates.

• We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  review  of  judgments  made  and  significant  assumptions  used  to  develop  key  estimates,

including controls over the key data used in developing the estimates and the mathematical extrapolation of such data.

• We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial statement impact,
including the appropriateness of the timing of changes to key estimates, when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management’s
estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.

Program Accounting Estimates for the 777X Program – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risk associated with meeting development, certification and production schedules. The
Company uses program accounting in order to compute cost of sales and margin for each commercial airplane sold. The use of program accounting
requires  estimating  and  demonstrating  customer  demand  for  the  number  of  units  included  in  the  program  (program  accounting  quantity)  and
estimating the sales and costs over the expected life of each program. In particular, estimating the initial program accounting quantity and revenue
for unsold units within the program accounting quantity involves measurement uncertainty resulting in a range of reasonable outcomes. Additionally,
the level of effort to meet regulatory requirements and achieve certification may be challenging to predict, resulting in delays in the timing of entry
into  service  and  corresponding  increases  in  estimated  costs.  Changes  to  the  program  accounting  quantity  or  revenue  and  cost  estimates  could
occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reach-forward  losses.  Auditing  the  estimated  revenues  and  costs  for  the  777X  program  involved
extensive  audit  effort  and  required  audit  professionals  with  specialized  industry  experience  given  the  high  degree  of  complexity  and  subjectivity
related to management’s estimates.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures over the estimated revenues and costs for the anticipated 777X program accounting quantity included the following, among
others:

• We inquired of the Company’s management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current sales

campaigns, short and long-term market demand, and status of negotiations with individual customers.

• We compared management’s estimate of market demand to external industry sources of expected demand.

• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions used in developing its estimates

related to the initial program accounting quantity and revenue for unsold units.

• We  evaluated  management’s  ability  to  estimate  program  revenue  by  comparison  to  historical  estimates  and  actual  results  on  similar

programs.

• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its cost estimates.

• We performed inquiries of those directly involved with the certification of the aircraft to evaluate project status and challenges which may

affect total estimated costs to achieve certification of the aircraft.

• We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical extrapolation

of such data, and management’s judgment regarding the range of reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.

Program Accounting Revenue Estimates for the 787 Program — Refer to Notes 1, 7, and 22 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

Production  quality  issues  for  the  787  Program  have  resulted  in  increased  risk  associated  with  forecasted  revenue  estimates  primarily  due  to  the
difficulty in assessing the timeline for restarting 787 deliveries. The Company uses program accounting in order to compute cost of sales and margin
for  each  commercial  airplane  sold.  The  use  of  program  accounting  requires  estimating  the  revenue  expected  to  be  earned  upon  delivery  of  the
aircraft included in the program’s accounting quantity. The timing of the Federal Aviation Administration's (“FAA”) approval to resume deliveries, the
impact to the delivery schedule from delayed deliveries, and the value of the consideration expected to be provided to customers for delivery delays
are  key  factors  that  affect  estimated  revenue.  There  is  increased  estimation  uncertainty  related  to  the  revenue  forecasts  of  aircraft  which  have
reached  or  are  expected  to  reach  a  delivery  delay  period  that  provides  the  customer  with  a  contractual  termination  right.  Due  to  continued
uncertainty in the expected FAA approval date to resume 787 aircraft deliveries, there is significant judgment in determining which aircraft will reach
these  contractual  termination  rights.  Changes  to  the  expected  delivery  resumption  date  could  have  a  flowthrough  impact  and  result  in  additional
consideration to customers. This could result in lower margins or further material reach-forward losses. Auditing the estimated revenues for the 787
program  involved  extensive  audit  effort  and  required  professionals  with  specialized  industry  experience  given  the  high  degree  of  complexity  and
subjectivity related to management’s estimates.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures over the estimated revenues for the 787 program included the following, among others:

• We inquired of the Company’s management, including individuals responsible for engineering and production operations, to assess whether
the  estimated  FAA  approval  and  delivery  resumption  date  represent  management’s  best  estimates  based  on  the  status  of  the  rework
activity.

• We  inquired  of  the  Company’s  management,  including  the  individuals  communicating  with  the  FAA,  to  assess  if  there  is  contradictory
information  to  that  assumed  by  management  related  to  the  estimated  timeline  for  rework  completion  or  getting  FAA  approval  to  resume
deliveries.

• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s method for developing the deliveries schedule assumptions.

• We  inquired  of  the  Company’s  management,  including  individuals  responsible  for  sales  and  pricing,  to  evaluate  the  status  of  current

contracts with customers and expected consideration to be provided to customers.

• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions used in developing its estimates

related to forecasted revenue for aircraft which have or are expected to have delivery delays.

• We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical extrapolation

of such data, and management’s judgment regarding the range of reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.

Liabilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding – Refer to Note 13 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

In 2019, following two fatal 737 MAX accidents, the FAA and non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued orders suspending commercial operations of
737 MAX aircraft (the “737 MAX Grounding”). Deliveries resumed in the U.S. in late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding order.

During 2019, the Company recorded an initial liability in connection with estimated payments, concessions and other in-kind consideration it intends
to  provide  to  customers  for  disruptions  related  to  the  737  MAX  Grounding  and  associated  delivery  delays.  This  liability  totaled  $2.9  billion  at
December 31, 2021 and is reflected in the financial statements in Accrued liabilities. Of the $2.9 billion, $2.2 billion has been contractually agreed to
with customers. The liability represents the Company’s best estimate of future concessions and other consideration to its customers. To the extent
not contractually agreed upon, the estimate is based on individual negotiations with customers and the substance of such negotiations.

The subjectivity of the estimate of approximately $0.7 billion relating to consideration that has not yet been contractually agreed to with customers
involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures associated with liabilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding included the following, among others:

• We inquired of management to understand developments with the 737 MAX Grounding, including the status of consideration negotiations

with individual customers.

• We  obtained  written  representations  from  management  concerning  its  intent  to  provide  consideration  to  customers  and the  extent  of  that

consideration.

• We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management to estimate the liability for customer consideration, and, where possible, we

corroborated the significant assumptions with management outside of the accounting and finance organizations.

• We reviewed the terms of customer contracts and correspondence with customers concerning potential consideration as a result of the 737

MAX Grounding.

• We evaluated the terms of settlement agreements with customers for the allocation of value provided between consideration as a result of

the 737 MAX Grounding and for consideration related to the impact of current economic conditions resulting from COVID-19.

• We evaluated delivery documents for 737 MAX deliveries for incremental value provided at delivery as potential consideration as a result of

the 737 MAX Grounding.

• We read minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees for evidence of unrecorded loss contingencies.

• We evaluated the Company’s disclosures for consistency with our knowledge of matters related to the 737 MAX Grounding.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021,
based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  — Integrated  Framework  (2013 )  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the
Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
consolidated  financial  statements  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  of  the  Company,  and  our  report  dated  January  31,  2022
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the
effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all material  respects.  Our  audit  included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A
company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the
company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

130

Table of Contents

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Introduction

Plan Overview

The Boeing Company Executive Supplemental Savings Plan provides four separate components:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

Extra Deferrals, the purpose of which is to provide a means by which eligible employees may defer payment of their
base salaries and awards made under eligible incentive compensation plans (a traditional deferred compensation
benefit);

the Restoration Benefit, the purpose of which is to restore the benefits of eligible employees under The Boeing
Company 401(k) Retirement Plan (“Boeing 401(k),” previously named The Boeing Company Voluntary Investment
Plan), to the extent that these qualified plan benefits are limited by Code sections 415 and 401(a)(17);

Executive Benefit, which includes Company Non-Elective Contributions, DC SERP Contributions, and historic
Executive SSP+ Company Contributions; and

DCP Accounts, which are the recordkeeping accounts established for Participants who participated in the Deferred
Compensation Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company, which was frozen December 31, 2018 and merged into
this Plan effective January 1, 2022.

Plan History

The Plan (originally named, the Supplemental Benefit Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company) (the “Plan”) was originally
established effective January 1, 1978, by The Boeing Company.

The Plan has been amended and restated from time to time since its original effective date, including on January 1, 2008, to comply
with section 409A of the Code.

As of January 1, 2022, the Plan is amended and restated to (A) reflect the merger of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees
of The Boeing Company with and into the Plan, (B) eliminate Restoration SSP+ Company Contributions and Executive SSP+
Company Contributions, (C) add a new Restoration True-Up Contribution, Incentive Matching Contribution and Company Non-
Elective Contribution, (D) simplify the mid-year enrollment provisions in the Participant Deferral component of the Plan, and (E)
make certain other changes.

Plan Status

The Plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Code section 409A. It is also intended that the Plan shall be, in
part, an excess benefit plan as defined in section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(ERISA), to the extent benefits are paid in excess of the limits imposed by Code section 415. To the extent any part of the Plan is not
an excess benefit plan, it is intended that the Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily

1

for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees under
sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

represented by a union with a collective bargaining agreement covering such Employee that does not provide for

payable from the Boeing 401(k) upon the death of the Participant. If no effective designation is on file under this Plan or the

the Boeing 401(k) will apply to determine the Beneficiary under the Plan. A Beneficiary may disclaim his or her benefit in

designation will apply.

Annual Participation and Deferrals – Eligibility

ARTICLE III

Participant Deferrals

The Plan provides Eligible Employees with two ways to defer Compensation on a pre-tax basis– the Extra Deferral
component and the Restoration Deferral component. Only Eligible Employees will be permitted to participate.

Elections to take effect with respect to a full Plan Year will generally be made during the annual Election Period.

(A)

Extra Deferral Component

An individual is an Eligible Employee for purposes of making an Extra Deferral Election for a Plan Year if he or she is an
Employee paid on a U.S. dollar-based payroll as of the Eligibility Determination Date.

In any Extra Deferral Election, an Eligible Employee may defer up to a maximum of: (i) in the case of Base Pay Deferrals,
50% of his or her Base Pay payable in the Plan Year to which the Deferral Election applies, (ii) in the case of Cash Incentive
Deferrals, 100% of his or her Cash Incentive earned in the Plan Year to which the Deferral Election applies (even if payable
in a subsequent Plan Year), and/or (iii) in the case of Vested Performance Award Deferrals, 100% of his or her Performance
Awards granted in the Plan Year to which the Deferral Election applies, which grant generally covers the next three (3) Plan
Years (even if payable in a subsequent Plan Year). For clarity, Extra Deferrals will be made without regard to the Code
section 401(a)(17) and 415(c) limitations.

Extra Deferrals will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the Compensation would otherwise be payable, or as
soon thereafter as administratively feasible.

(B)

Restoration Deferral Component

In any Restoration Deferral Election, an Eligible Employee may elect a deferral percentage up to the maximum percentage of
his or her Base Pay that the Employee can elect to contribute on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth basis under the Boeing
401(k). Restoration Deferrals will be made from the Eligible Employee’s Base Pay only after either: (1) Base Pay for the
applicable Plan Year reaches the limitation under Code section 401(a)(17), as indexed, for such Plan Year or (2) the
Participant’s annual additions under the Boeing 401(k) for the applicable Plan Year reach the dollar limitation of Code
section 415(c), as indexed.

Restoration Deferrals will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the Compensation would otherwise be payable,
or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.

11

3.2 Mid-Year Participation– Eligibility

To the extent permitted by and in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Administrator, an Employee who is Newly
Eligible during a Plan Year may elect (A) Extra Deferrals up to a maximum of 50% of the Base Pay earned and payable in
each full regular pay period commencing after the end of the Election Period (or such other date determined by the
Administrator in accordance with Code Section 409A) for the remainder of the applicable Plan Year, (B) Restoration
Deferrals (if the Eligible Employee satisfies the criteria of this Section) and (C) the form and time of distribution of the
Account with respect to such Plan Year, as permitted by Section 6.1. Such mid-year elections will be made during the mid-
year Election Period. Different mid-year election rules applied with respect to Plan Years prior to January 1, 2022. Mid-year
elections cannot be made for Cash Incentive Deferrals or Vested Performance Award Deferrals.

In any mid-year Restoration Deferral election, an Eligible Employee will be permitted to make a Restoration Deferral
election with respect to Base Pay earned and payable in each full regular pay period commencing after the end of the
Election Period for the remainder of such Plan Year up to the maximum percentage of his or her Base Pay that the Employee
can elect to contribute on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth basis under the Boeing 401(k) for such period. Restoration
Deferrals will be made from the Eligible Employee’s Base Pay only after either: (1) Base Pay for the applicable Plan Year
reaches the limitation under Code section 401(a)(17), as indexed, for such Plan Year or (2) the Participant’s annual additions
under the Boeing 401(k) for the applicable Plan Year reach the dollar limitation of Code section 415(c), as indexed.

3.3

Deferral Elections

An Eligible Employee may elect to defer a percentage of his or her eligible Compensation for a Plan Year (or portion of a
Plan Year in the case of a mid-year enrollment) on a pre-tax basis by executing and delivering one or more timely Deferral
Election(s) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3. The type and amount of eligible Compensation that may be
deferred is described in Section 3.1 (for annual deferrals) and Section 3.2 (for mid-year deferrals).

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent any Eligible Employee had in effect an active (A) Restoration
Deferral Election under this Plan immediately prior to its amendment and restatement as of January 1, 2019 and does not
timely change such Restoration Deferral Election with respect to the Plan Year beginning on January 1, 2019, such Eligible
Employee shall be deemed to have continued such active Restoration Deferral Election with respect to the Plan Year
beginning on January 1, 2019 and (except as otherwise provided below for Employees who cease to be Eligible Employees)
future Plan Years on an “evergreen basis” unless and until such Eligible Employee changes such Restoration Deferral
Election in accordance with this Section 3.3; or (B) election to defer compensation under the DCP immediately prior to that
plan’s amendment and restatement as of January 1, 2019 and fails either to make a timely Extra Deferral Election or to
indicate affirmatively that he or she does not wish to make an Extra Deferral Election with respect to the Plan Year beginning
on January 1, 2019, such Eligible Employee shall be deemed to have made an Extra Deferral Election identical to such
election to defer compensation under the DCP with respect to the Plan Year beginning on January 1, 2019 and (except as
otherwise provided below for Employees who cease to be Eligible Employees) future Plan Years on an “evergreen basis”
unless and until such Eligible Employee changes such Extra Deferral Election in accordance with this Section 3.3.

12

(A)

Deferral Elections

An Eligible Employee’s Deferral Election(s) must be made in accordance with rules established by the Administrator.
An Eligible Employee may make separate Extra Deferral Elections with respect to Base Pay, Cash Incentive and
Performance Awards and/or a separate Restoration Deferral Election with respect to Base Pay, each to the extent
described in Section 3.1 or 3.2, as applicable.

Eligible Employees may make new Deferral Elections for each succeeding Plan Year. An Eligible Employee’s
Deferral Election will be “evergreen” – it will carry-over from Plan Year to Plan Year (or from a partial Plan Year to
the subsequent Plan Year in the case of a mid-year enrollment) unless it is changed or cancelled in accordance with
rules established by the Administrator or as otherwise provided in this Plan.

In the case of an Employee who ceases to be an Eligible Employee during the Plan Year (e.g., due to a reclassification
as other than E-Series Payroll or Separation from Service) the Employee’s Deferral Election(s) shall remain in effect
with respect to the Plan Year in which the Employee ceases to be an Eligible Employee, but will automatically be
cancelled with respect to future Deferrals (i.e., Deferrals with respect to subsequent Plan Years).

(B)

Distribution Elections

Deferral Elections will include an option to elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to the Participant
Deferrals, as described in Article VI, as applicable.

Any election made as to the form and timing of distribution with respect to Restoration Deferrals will apply to the
Participant’s entire Restoration Account.

(C)

Timing and Irrevocability of Elections

In general, the Deferral Election must be filed during the applicable Election Period.

Deferral Elections with respect to a full Plan Year will generally become irrevocable as of the end of the Election
Period. Deferral Elections with respect to a mid-year participation will become irrevocable as of the last day of the
mid-year Election Period.

Once Deferral Elections become irrevocable they generally may not be modified with respect to the Plan Year, and
the Compensation, to which they apply. Likewise, an Employee who makes a Restoration Deferral Election will be
subject to restrictions on mid-year contribution election changes under the Boeing 401(k), in accordance with the
terms of the Boeing 401(k).

See Section 3.4 for a limited exception to the general rule on the irrevocability of Deferral Elections, in the event of
Unforeseeable Emergency.

13

(D)

No Mid-Year Elections

Except as provided in this Article III, an Employee who becomes Newly Eligible during a Plan Year (including as a
result of a salary increase) will not be eligible to make Participant Deferrals during such Plan Year.

3.4

Cancellation of Deferral Election Due to Unforeseeable Emergency

Notwithstanding the irrevocability rule described in Section 3.3, a Participant will be permitted to cancel an existing Deferral
Election with regard to a Plan Year during that Plan Year, if the Participant incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency, as
determined by the Administrator.

If a Participant has elected and received a distribution due to an Unforeseeable Emergency under Section 6.1(I), the
Participant will be deemed to have elected to cancel his or her Deferral Election(s) that relate to Base Pay for the remainder
of the applicable Plan Year.

3.5

Crediting of Deferrals to Account

In all cases, Participant Deferrals will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the Compensation would otherwise
have been payable, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.

14

4.1

Restoration Matching Contributions

ARTICLE IV

Company Contributions

A Participant who defers Base Pay pursuant to a Restoration Deferral Election under Section 3.3 will be credited with a
Restoration Matching Contribution from the Company related to such Restoration Deferrals. This Restoration Matching
Contribution will equal a percentage (determined based on the matching contribution formula applicable to the Participant
under the Boeing 401(k) for the Plan Year) of the Participant’s Restoration Deferrals for the Plan Year.

Restoration Matching Contributions under this Plan apply only to Participant Deferrals of Base Pay made pursuant to a
Restoration Deferral Election. Restoration Matching Contributions will not be made with respect to Participant Deferrals of
Base Pay made pursuant to an Extra Deferral Election.

An Eligible Employee must make a timely Restoration Deferral Election, as described in Section 3.3, to become eligible to
participate in the Restoration Matching Contribution component of the Plan. Distribution elections are discussed in Article
VI.

Restoration Matching Contributions will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date that the underlying Restoration
Deferrals are credited to the Participant’s Account.

4.2

Restoration True-Up Contributions

The Company may choose to make a Restoration True-Up Contribution to this Plan on behalf of certain Eligible Employees.
The Restoration True-Up Contribution, if any, will be equal to the portion of the matching contribution true-up that would
have been made to the Boeing 401(k) for the Eligible Employee but for the limitations imposed by Code section 415(c), as
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided that no Company Non-Elective Contribution will be made if the
Employee terminates from employment prior to the last business day of the Plan Year for any reason other than retirement
(for this purpose, after attaining age 55 with 10 years of service or after attaining age 62 with 1 year of service), disability
(for this purpose, meaning the Eligible Employee is determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration), layoff,
or death.

An Eligible Employee for purposes of this Section 4.2 need not make (or be eligible to make) a timely Restoration Deferral
Election for a Plan Year in order to receive an allocation of Restoration True-Up Contributions for such Plan Year. Available
distribution elections are discussed in Article VI.

The Restoration True-Up Contribution, if any, will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date that true-up
contributions are made to the Boeing 401(k), or as soon as thereafter administratively feasible.

15

4.3

Incentive Matching Contributions

Subject to the conditions of this Section 4.3, a Participant who makes Cash Incentive Deferrals under Section 3.3 will be
credited with an Incentive Matching Contribution from the Company related to such Cash Incentive Deferrals. This Incentive
Matching Contribution will equal a percentage (determined based on the matching contribution formula applicable to the
Participant under the Boeing 401(k) for the Plan Year) of the Participant’s Cash Incentive Deferrals for the Plan Year.

An Eligible Employee must make a timely Cash Incentive Deferral Election, as described in Section 3.3, to become eligible
for the related Incentive Matching Contributions. Distribution elections are discussed in Article VI.

Incentive Matching Contributions will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date that the underlying Cash Incentive
Deferrals are credited to the Participant’s Account.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incentive Matching Contribution will be made with respect to any Cash Incentive
Deferrals that are paid (or, but for the Participant’s Cash Incentive Deferral election, would be paid) after the date the
Participant terminates from employment.

4.4

Company Non-Elective Contributions (Component of the Executive Benefit)

The Company may make a Company Non-Elective Contribution to this Plan with respect to a Plan Year on behalf of certain
Eligible Employees; provided that no Company Non-Elective Contribution will be made if the Employee terminates from
employment prior to the last business day of the Plan Year for any reason other than retirement (for this purpose, after
attaining age 55 with 10 years of service or after attaining age 62 with 1 year of service), disability (for this purpose, meaning
the Eligible Employee is determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration), layoff, or death.

The Company Non-Elective Contribution for a Plan Year will equal a percentage of the eligible Participant’s Compensation
paid by the Company during the applicable pay periods within such Plan Year. This percentage will be equal to the Company
discretionary non-elective contribution percentage for which the Participant is eligible for such pay period under the Boeing
401(k).

An Eligible Employee for purposes of this Section 4.4 need not make (or be eligible to make) deferrals to the Plan in order to
receive an allocation of Company Non-Elective Contributions for such Plan Year. Available distribution elections are
discussed in Article VI.

A Company Non-Elective Contribution will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the related Company 401(k)
Non-Elective Contribution is made to the Boeing 401(k), or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.

16

4.5

DC SERP Contributions (Component of the Executive Benefit)

(A)

Eligibility

An Employee is eligible to receive DC SERP Contributions with respect to a Plan Year for so long as he or she satisfies the
conditions in either (i) or (ii) below. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no DC SERP Contributions will be
made for: (i) any elected officer on or after January 1, 2020, or (ii) any Employee who is hired or promoted onto the E-Series
Payroll on or after January 1, 2020.

(i)

Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019

An Employee satisfies the conditions in this subsection (i) if:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

The Employee was hired on or after January 1, 2009, but before January 1, 2020,

The Employee is on the E-Series Payroll in level E-1, E-2, or E-3, and was on the E-Series Payroll (in
any level E-1 through E-5) as of December 31, 2019,

The Employee is not an elected officer of the Company, and

The Employee is ineligible to accrue benefits under any defined benefit plan maintained by the
Controlled Group.

(ii)

Hired Before January 1, 2009

An Employee satisfies the conditions in this subsection (ii) if:

(a)

(b)

The Employee was hired before January 1, 2009,

The Employee was on the E-series Payroll (in any level E-1 through E-5) as of December 31, 2019,
and

(c)

The Employee is not an elected officer of the Company.

For purposes of determining eligibility for the DC SERP, the term “hired” generally refers to an Employee’s most recent date
of hire or rehire with the Company, except as provided below, regardless of the date on which the Employee joins the E-
Series Payroll.

For this purpose:

(a)

Approved Leaves of Absence. A return to the Controlled Group directly from an approved leave of
absence, without incurring a termination of employment, is not considered a rehire.

For this purpose, an Employee’s period of employment with ULA or USA will be considered an
approved leave of absence, to the extent that the Employee first transferred directly from the
Controlled Group to ULA or USA and subsequently transferred directly from ULA or USA back to the
Controlled Group.

17

(b)

(c)

Transfers. A transfer of employment among members of the Controlled Group, without interruption, is
not considered a rehire and, accordingly, the most recent date of hire or rehire for purposes of
determining such a transferred Employee’s eligibility would be the Employee’s most recent date of
hire or rehire with the Company’s controlled group member from which the Employee transferred.

Layoffs. A rehire to the Controlled Group following a termination of employment due to layoff
generally will not be treated as a rehire, if rehire occurs within six years of the layoff event. However,
a laid off Employee who commences a retirement benefit during this six year period will be treated as
a rehire if he or she later rehires to the Controlled Group.

An individual who became a “group-acquired employee” after September 30, 2008 and before January
1, 2009 will be deemed to have been hired on or after January 1, 2009, for purposes of determining
eligibility to receive a contribution for periods on and after January 1, 2009. No contribution will be
paid prior to January 1, 2009. For this purpose, a “group-acquired employee” refers to an employee of
the Company who became such as an immediate or ultimate result of a merger to which the Company
was a party, or of the acquisition by the Company of all or part of the assets, businesses or capital
stock of another corporation or firm.

(B)

DC SERP Participation

An Eligible Employee will be a Participant in the DC SERP for the period(s), if any, that the Employee satisfies the
eligibility conditions in Section 4.5(A).

(C)

DC SERP Contributions

Each Participant eligible for DC SERP Contributions shall be entitled to contributions under this Plan as described below.

(i)

Payroll Contributions

Contributions will be credited to the Participant’s Account on the date the Base Pay and Cash Incentive otherwise
would be payable, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.

(a)

Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019

A Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(i) (Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019) will
receive a DC SERP contribution equal to a Contribution Credit times the sum of the Participant’s Base Pay
and Cash Incentive, for each applicable pay period. The Contribution Credit for a pay period is determined by
the Participant’s level as of such pay period as follows:

(1) 2%, for a Participant at level E-2 through E-3.

18

(2) 4%, for a Participant at level E-1.

If a Participant changes levels during a pay period, the Participant’s level as in effect on the last day of the pay
period will apply. For purposes of calculating the DC SERP contribution, a Participant’s Base Pay and Cash
Incentive will be counted solely to the extent that (1) the Participant is on the E-Series Payroll during the
applicable pay period or (2) such Cash Incentive is paid after a Participant’s termination of employment from
the Controlled Group but on or before such Participant receives his or her final regular paycheck.

(b)

Hired Before January 1, 2009

A Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(ii) (Hired Before January 1, 2009) will receive a DC SERP
contribution equal to a Contribution Credit times the sum of the Participant’s Base Pay and Cash Incentive,
for each applicable pay period. For purposes of calculating the DC SERP contribution, a Participant’s Base
Pay and Cash Incentive will be counted solely to the extent that (1) the Participant is on the E-Series Payroll
during the applicable pay period or (2) such Cash Incentive is paid after a Participant’s termination of
employment from the Controlled Group but on or before such Participant receives his or her final regular
paycheck.

The Contribution Credit will equal the sum of (i) and, if applicable, (ii):

(1) 5%

(2) For a Participant who has attained age 55 (or will attain age 55 by the end of a Plan Year), 0.5% times

the Participant’s whole years of Benefit Service (as defined under the PVP and/or BSS Plan, as
applicable, and determined as of January 1, 2016), subject to the limitation herein. The supplemental
percentage credited under this subsection (ii) will be contributed for a period not to exceed seven
years. This seven-year period will commence on January 1, 2016 (or on January 1 of the year in which
the Participant attains age 55, or on the date of promotion to the E-Series Payroll, whichever is latest)
and will be measured in the aggregate over a Participant’s lifetime (i.e., regardless of whether the
Participant has multiple periods of employment with the Controlled Group).

19

(ii)

One-Time Contribution

An Employee who satisfies the requirements described in Section 4.5(A)(i) (Hired Between January 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2019), and who is first promoted to a level of E-1 through E-3 (from a position at a level of E-4 or E-5)
during the Plan Year, will receive a one-time additional contribution equal to the product of (a), (b) and (c) below.

(a)

(b)

(c)

2%

The sum of:

(1) the Participant’s Base Pay Rate in effect immediately following the promotion, and

(2) his or her Cash Incentive target percentage multiplied by the Base Pay Rate, both as in effect

immediately following the promotion.

The Participant’s whole years of Service as of the date of first promotion to a level of E-1 through E-3
(from a position at a level of E-4 or E-5); provided that, for such purpose, a Participant’s years of
Service will be limited to Service earned since his or her most recent hire date.

This amount will be credited to the Participant’s Account as of the date of first promotion to a level of E-1 through E-
3, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible.

A Participant who has received a one-time contribution under this Section upon promotion to a level of E-1 through
E-3 will be ineligible for any further contributions under this subsection (C)(ii).

The Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, that a Participant will forfeit any part or all of the portion of his or
her legacy Executive SSP+ Company Contribution Account that is attributable to Executive SSP+ Company Contributions
made on and after January 1, 2017, if any of the following circumstances occur while employed by the Controlled Group or
within five (5) years after termination of such employment:

(A)

(B)

The Participant is convicted of a felony involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the
Controlled Group or against the Controlled Group’s interests. For purposes of this Plan, “other similar unlawful acts
against the Controlled Group or against the Controlled Group’s interests” shall include any other unlawful act
(i) committed against the Controlled Group, or the interests of the Controlled Group, including, but not limited to, a
governmental agency or instrumentality which conducts business with the Controlled Group, or a customer of the
Controlled Group, or (ii) affecting the Controlled Group or the interests of the Controlled Group, in such a manner that
is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the Controlled Group or the interests of the
Controlled Group, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

The Participant, directly or indirectly, engages in any activity, whether individually or as an employee, consultant or
otherwise, which the Administrator determines, in its sole discretion, to be an activity in which the Participant is
“engaging in competition” with any significant aspect of Controlled Group business. For purposes of this Plan,
“engaging in competition” shall include but is not limited to representing, providing services to, or being an employee
of or associated in a business capacity with, any person or entity that is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition
with any Controlled Group business or that takes a position adverse

21

to any Controlled Group business, regardless of the position or duties the Participant takes, in such a manner that is
determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Controlled Group, all as
determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

The Participant, without the advance approval of The Boeing Company’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources
(or successor position thereto), induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Controlled Group’s
employees, representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Controlled Group,
or to breach any contract with the Controlled Group, in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the
Participant or any third party.

The Participant disparages or otherwise makes any statements about the Controlled Group, its products, or its
employees that could be in any way viewed as negative or critical. Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally
protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in
administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.

The Participant uses or discloses proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to trade secrets, of
the Controlled Group. Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government
agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.

(C)

(D)

(E)

To the extent the Participant has already received or commenced payment of such portion of his or her Executive SSP+
Company Contribution Account, the Administrator will be entitled to pursue any and all legal and equitable relief against the
Participant to enforce the forfeiture of and recover the amount distributed from such Executive SSP+ Company Contribution
Account. The forfeiture provisions will continue to apply unless and to the extent modified by a court of competent
jurisdiction. However, if any portion of these forfeiture provisions is held by such a court to be unenforceable, these
provisions shall be deemed amended to limit their scope to the broadest scope that such authority determines is enforceable,
and as so amended shall continue in effect.

In addition, the Administrator will, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of any Executive SSP+ Company
Contribution Account attributable to Executive SSP+ Company Contributions made on and after January 1, 2017, which are
attributable to an incentive award that the Controlled Group seeks to recover under the clawback provision of any plan
providing Cash Incentive.

22

5.6

DC SERP Vesting

No payments shall be made from a Participant’s DC SERP Account except to the extent such Participant is vested in his or
her DC SERP Account.

(A)

General DC SERP Vesting Rule for Participants Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019

A Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(i) (Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019) will vest 100%
in his or her DC SERP Account component(s) covered under this subsection (A) on the date the Participant satisfies
the conditions in any of (i), (ii) or (iii) below.

(i)

The Participant has been on the E-Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3 for a period of 36 consecutive
months. (For Participants with prior periods of employment, a period of consecutive months before January 1,
2009 on the E-Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3 will be counted for purposes of determining
whether this 36 consecutive month requirement has been satisfied.)

(ii)

The Participant dies while an Employee.

(iii)

The Participant is laid off from a position at level E-1 through E-3 and is eligible for benefits under The
Boeing Company Executive Layoff Benefits Plan.

See subsection  (C) below for additional vesting rules for these Participants based on age and Service.

(B)

General DC SERP Vesting Rule for Participants Hired Before January 1, 2009

A Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(ii) (Hired Before January 1, 2009) will vest 100% in his or her DC SERP
Account component covered under this subsection (B) on the date the Participant satisfies the conditions in any of (i),
(ii) or (iii) below.

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

The Participant has been on the E-Series Payroll for a period of 36 consecutive months. For a Participant on
the E-Series Payroll as of January 1, 2016, a period of consecutive months before January 1, 2016 on the E-
Series Payroll will be counted for purposes of determining whether this 36 consecutive month requirement has
been satisfied.

The Participant is fully vested under the PVP and/or BSS Plan, as applicable, and dies while an Employee
before his or her DC SERP Account commences payment under this Plan.

The Participant is laid off from an E-Series position and is eligible for benefits under The Boeing Company
Executive Layoff Benefits Plan.

23

(C)

Special Vesting Rules for Participants Hired Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 with 55/10 or 62/1

Special vesting rules apply for a Participant described in Section 4.5(A)(i) (Hired Between January 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2019) who has attained either (i) or (ii) while employed by the Controlled Group.

(i)

(ii)

Age 55 with 10 years of Service, or

Age 62 with one year of Service.

This Participant will be 100% vested in the portion of his or her DC SERP Account described in Section 4.5(C)(i)
(Payroll Contributions) after he or she has been on the E-Series Payroll for a period of 36 consecutive months.

This Participant will vest ratably in the portion of his or her DC SERP Account described in Section 4.5(C)(ii) (One-
Time Contribution), if any, at the rate of 1/36 for each consecutive month that the Participant is on the E-Series
Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3, starting with the date on which the Participant was first promoted to the E-
Series Payroll at a level of E-1 through E-3. This pro rata vesting rule is not intended to preclude the acceleration of
vesting under subsections (A)(ii) (death) or (iii) (layoff) above, if applicable.

(D)

Authorized Period of Absence

For purposes of this Section, an Authorized Period of Absence from the E-Series Payroll will count as a period on the
E-Series Payroll, and an Authorized Period of Absence from a position at level E-1 through E-3 will count as a period
at these levels.

If an Employee ceases to be at the applicable level for any reason other than an Authorized Period of Absence, and
the Employee later returns to a position at the applicable level, these non-consecutive periods of service will not be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the 36-consecutive month requirement has been met.

(E)

Transfers to and from ULA and USA

For purposes of computing vesting for a Participant who transfers employment directly from the Controlled Group to
ULA or USA, uninterrupted service at ULA or USA as an executive in a position at a comparable level will be
credited toward the 36 consecutive months requirements described herein, provided that the Participant transfers
directly from the E-Series Payroll (or a position at level E-1 through E-3 if applicable) at the Controlled Group to
comparable executive status at ULA or USA, as applicable. ULA and USA service will not be credited toward vesting
under this Plan for any period following the Participant’s removal from this executive status. For purposes of
computing vesting for a participant who transfers employment directly from ULA or USA to the Controlled Group,
uninterrupted service at ULA or USA as an executive at a position comparable to the E-Series Payroll (or a position at
level E-1 through E-3, if applicable) will be credited toward the 36 consecutive months requirements described
herein, provided that the Participant transfers directly from this executive status at ULA or USA to a position at a
comparable level at the Controlled Group. ULA and USA service will not be credited toward vesting under this Plan
for any period

24

prior to the Participant’s attainment of this executive status at ULA or USA, as applicable.

(F)

Impact of Separation from Service/Transfer

(i)

(ii)

Payroll Contributions. If a Participant Separates from Service (other than due to an Authorized Period of
Absence) or transfers off of the E-Series Payroll (or a position at level E-1 through E-3, if applicable) before
becoming 100% vested in the payroll contribution portion of his or her DC SERP Account described in
Section 4.5(C)(i)(A) and/or (i)(B), as applicable, the Participant will forfeit all rights to the nonvested portion
of his or her DC SERP Account attributable to the period prior to his or her Separation from Service or
transfer. To the extent any benefit under this Plan becomes vested during an Authorized Period of Absence
that continues after a deemed Separation from Service, it will remain subject to the payment timing rules
under Section 6.1.

One-Time Contributions. If a Participant stops accruing service toward satisfaction of applicable vesting
requirements (such as due to a Separation from Service) after becoming partially vested in the one-time
contribution portion of the DC SERP Account, under subsection (C) above, and the Participant subsequently
resumes accruing service toward satisfaction of applicable vesting requirements, the DC SERP Account
accrued after such resumption will not be vested until the Participant satisfies the requirements of
subsection (A) or (C) above following such resumption.

(iii) Multiple DC SERP Account Components. Separate vesting requirements apply to each component of a

Participant’s DC SERP Account described in Sections 4.4(C)(i)(a), (i)(b), and (ii). This means that a
Participant who has accrued more than one DC SERP Account component (such as, due to a Separation from
Service and subsequent rehire) must satisfy the vesting requirements applicable to each such component. If a
Participant Separates from Service after becoming 100% vested in a particular DC SERP Account component,
the Participant will be fully vested in any additional accruals under the same DC SERP Account component
following rehire or return (even if the Participant fails to be at the applicable pay level for 36 consecutive
months following rehire or return). The Participant will not, however, be fully vested in any amounts accrued
under a different DC SERP Account component unless and until the corresponding applicable vesting
requirements under this Section 5.5 otherwise have been satisfied.

See Section 7.4 regarding missing participants and improper credits, Section 10.2 regarding anti-assignment, and
Section 10.3 regarding the unfunded nature of this Plan. Any amounts forfeited hereunder will not later be reinstated.

25

5.7

DC SERP Forfeiture Rules

The Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, that a Participant will forfeit any part or all of his or her DC SERP
Account if any of the following circumstances occur while employed by the Controlled Group or within five (5) years after
termination of such employment:

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

The Participant is convicted of a felony involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against
the Controlled Group or against the Controlled Group’s interests. For purposes of this Plan, “other similar unlawful
acts against the Controlled Group or against the Controlled Group’s interests” shall include any other unlawful act
(i) committed against the Controlled Group, or the interests of the Controlled Group, including, but not limited to, a
governmental agency or instrumentality which conducts business with the Controlled Group, or a customer of the
Controlled Group, or (ii) affecting the Controlled Group or the interests of the Controlled Group, in such a manner
that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in conflict with the Controlled Group or the interests of the
Controlled Group, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

The Participant, directly or indirectly, engages in any activity, whether individually or as an employee, consultant or
otherwise, which the Administrator determines, in its sole discretion, to be an activity in which the Participant is
“engaging in competition” with any significant aspect of Controlled Group business. For purposes of this Plan,
“engaging in competition” shall include but is not limited to representing, providing services to, or being an employee
of or associated in a business capacity with, any person or entity that is engaged, directly or indirectly, in competition
with any Controlled Group business or that takes a position adverse to any Controlled Group business, regardless of
the position or duties the Participant takes, in such a manner that is determined to be detrimental to, prejudicial to or in
conflict with the interests of the Controlled Group, all as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

The Participant, without the advance approval of The Boeing Company’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources
(or equivalent but for title), induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Controlled Group’s
employees, representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Controlled Group,
or to breach any contract with the Controlled Group, in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the
Participant or any third party.

The Participant disparages or otherwise makes any statements about the Controlled Group, its products, or its
employees that could be in any way viewed as negative or critical. Nothing in this paragraph will apply to legally
protected communications to government agencies or statements made in the course of sworn testimony in
administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.

(E) With respect to contributions made to the Plan on and after January 1, 2017, the Participant uses or discloses

proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to trade secrets, of the Controlled Group. Nothing in
this paragraph will apply to legally protected communications to government agencies or

26

statements made in the course of sworn testimony in administrative, judicial, or arbitral proceedings.

To the extent the Participant has already received or commenced payment of his or her DC SERP Account, the Administrator
will be entitled to pursue any and all legal and equitable relief against the Participant to enforce the forfeiture of and recover
such benefit. The forfeiture provisions will continue to apply unless and to the extent modified by a court of competent
jurisdiction. However, if any portion of these forfeiture provisions is held by such a court to be unenforceable, these
provisions shall be deemed amended to limit their scope to the broadest scope that such authority determines is enforceable,
and as so amended shall continue in effect.

In addition, the Administrator will, in all appropriate circumstances, require forfeiture or reimbursement of any portion of a
DC SERP Account attributable to an incentive award that the Controlled Group seeks to recover under the clawback
provision of any plan providing Cash Incentive.

27

6.1

Form and Timing of Distribution

(A)

Extra Deferral Account

ARTICLE VI
Distributions

A Participant may elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to his or her Extra Deferral Account as
described below, subject to the cash-out rule in subsection (E) below. This distribution election must be made at the
same time the Participant makes his or her first Extra Deferral Election.

If a Participant fails to make a timely election with regard to the timing of payment of his or her Extra Deferral
Account, then the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive payment in January of the first Plan Year
following the Participant’s Separation from Service (subject to subsection (H)). If a Participant fails to make a timely
election with regard to the form of payment of his or her Extra Deferral Account, then the Participant will be deemed
to have elected to receive payment in a lump sum.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent the Participant had in effect a distribution election
under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company immediately prior to January 1, 2019
and fails to make a timely election with regard to the timing or form of payment of his or her Extra Deferral Account,
such distribution election shall apply automatically to any future deferrals of the same type credited under this Plan
and such Participant will only be permitted to change such deemed election in accordance with subsection (F) below.

A Participant may change a distribution election (or deemed distribution election) with respect to his or her entire
Extra Deferral Account after the initial Extra Deferral Election is made (or deemed made), to the extent permitted and
in accordance with the conditions stated under subsection (F) below.

(B)

Restoration Account

A Participant may elect the form and timing of distribution with regard to his or her Restoration Account as described
below, subject to the cash-out rule in subsection (E) below. This distribution election must be made at the same time
the Participant makes his or her first Restoration Deferral Election or, if earlier, during the enrollment period
immediately preceding the first year with respect to which the Participant receives a Company contribution to his or
her Restoration Account. Any election made as to the form and timing of distribution will apply to the Participant’s
entire Restoration Account, including the Restoration True-Up Contributions and the Restoration SSP+ Company
Contributions made for Plan Years prior to January 1, 2022, if any.

If a Participant fails to make a timely election with regard to the timing of payment of his or her Restoration Account,
then the Participant will be deemed to have elected to receive payment in January of the first Plan Year following the
Participant’s Separation from Service (subject to subsection (H)). If a Participant fails to make a timely election with
regard to the form of payment of his or her Restoration Account, then the Participant will be deemed to have elected
to receive payment in a lump sum.

28

A Participant may change a distribution election (or deemed distribution election) with respect to his or her entire
Restoration Account after the initial Restoration Deferral Election is made (or deemed made), to the extent permitted
and in accordance with the conditions stated under subsection (F) below.

(C)

Executive Benefit Account

No initial distribution elections are permitted or required with regard to a Participant’s Executive Benefit Account, to
which is credited Company Non-Elective Contributions, Executive SSP+ Company Contributions and DC SERP
Contributions. Rather, a Participant is deemed to have elected to receive his or her Executive Benefit Account in a
lump sum, payable in January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service (subject to subsection (H)).

A Participant may change his or her deemed distribution election with respect to his or her Executive Benefit Account
to the extent permitted and in accordance with the conditions stated under subsection (F) below.

(D)

Timing and Form of Distribution

(i)

Lump Sum Distribution

The lump sum distribution option is a single lump sum payment that will be made in the later of: (i) January of
the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first Plan Year following the
Participant’s attainment of a specified age (subject to subsection (E) below), as elected by the Participant
under this Section 6.1 (in each case subject to subsection (H) below). Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (H) below, the amount of such distribution will equal the value of the Participant’s Account as of
the first business day of January of the Plan Year of payment (or such other distribution valuation date as is
specified by the Administrator), and no additional interest or earnings will be credited thereafter.

(ii)    Installment Payment

The installment payment option is a series of annual installment payments for a period between 2 and 15
years, as elected by the Participant under this Section 6.1. Annual installment payments, if elected, will begin
in the later of: (i) January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service, or (ii) January of the first
Plan Year following the Participant’s attainment of a specified age (subject to (E) below), as elected by the
Participant under this Section 6.1 (in each case subject to subsection (H) below). Payments will continue to be
made each January thereafter until the full amount of the benefit has been paid.

The amount payable to the Participant each year shall be computed by dividing the balance in the Account (or
the applicable portion of the Account) as of the first business day of January of the Plan Year in which
payment is to be made (or such other distribution valuation date as is specified by the Administrator) by the
number of years remaining in the distribution period. No additional earnings or interest will be credited to a
Participant’s account with respect to an installment payment after the valuation date used to determine the
amount of such payment. See

29

Section 6.1(E) below for application of the cash-out rule to installment payments.

(E)

Cash-outs

Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the six-month delay in payment for Specified Employees under
subsection (H), if a Participant has elected to receive installments and his or her remaining Account balance is
$10,000 or less upon any scheduled payment date (excluding the balance of the DCP Account), the entire remaining
balance will be paid as one final installment payment at that time.

(F)

Changes to Distribution Election or Deemed Election

A Participant may change a distribution election (or deemed election) after the initial distribution election becomes
effective (or deemed effective) only once with regard to each of the following subaccounts: the Participant’s
Restoration Account, Executive Benefit Account, Extra Deferral Account, and DCP Account (Deferrals) and DCP
Account (Match).

Such election must change the time of payment (consistent with the requirement of clause (iii) below) and may
change the form of payment (from lump sum to installments, or vice versa). Subject to the following paragraph, such
election may be made at any time and need not be made during an annual enrollment period. If an election change is
made by an Eligible Employee during the annual enrollment period, it can be changed during such period and the last
change on file (if any) as of the end of the annual enrollment period will be irrevocable. If the election change is made
by an Eligible Employee outside of the annual enrollment period or at any time by a Participant who is not an Eligible
Employee, such election change will be irrevocable when made.

To the extent any such changes would defer commencement of any portion of the Participant’s Restoration Account,
Executive Benefit Account, Extra Deferral Account or DCP Account beyond both age 70½ and Separation from
Service, the changes will not be effective.

(i)

A new distribution election must be submitted in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Administrator at
least 12 months before the existing scheduled distribution date under the applicable subaccount.

(ii)

The revised distribution election must not take effect for at least 12 months after it is made.

(iii)

The new distribution election must provide for an additional deferral period of at least 5 years beyond the
original distribution date.

In no event can installment payments be changed or revoked once they have begun. In all cases, payments will be
made in January (subject to subsection (H)).

(G)

Distributions At Age 70½

Payment of benefits under this Plan will begin no later than the first January following the calendar year in which the
Participant both attains (or would have attained) age 70½ and is Separated from Service. Payment of benefits for
Participants actively employed beyond age 70½ will begin no later than the first

30

January following the calendar year in which the Participant Separates from Service. Subject to subsection (D), any
election made by a Participant to the contrary will not be effective.

(H)

Specified Employees

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under this Article VI, a Specified Employee will not receive any
distribution under this Plan during the six-month period immediately following his or her Separation from Service.

Subject to subsection (F) above, the Account of a Specified Employee will be distributed in the form elected (or
deemed elected) under subsection (A), (B), or (C) above, as applicable. This distribution will be made or commence
as of the latest of:

(1)

(2)

(3)

the time elected (or deemed elected) under subsection (A), (B), or (C), as applicable,

the month following completion of the six-month waiting period (for Specified Employees who Separate from
Service between July 1 and December 31), and

January of the first Plan Year following Separation from Service (for Specified Employees who Separate from
Service between January 1 and June 30).

If a Participant has elected installments, subsequent installment payments will be made in January of each successive
year until the Account is exhausted.

For payments occurring other than in January, the amount of the distribution will be determined based on the value of
the Participant’s Account as of the first business day of the month that payment will be made (or such other
distribution valuation date as is specified by the Administrator). No additional earnings or interest will be credited to
a Participant’s account with respect to a payment after the valuation date used to determine the amount of such
payment.

In the event of a Specified Employee’s death during the six-month waiting period, the waiting period will cease to
apply. The Specified Employee’s benefits will be distributed in accordance with Section 6.2 (Death Benefits) below.

(I)

Distribution Due to Unforeseeable Emergency

A Participant or Beneficiary may elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of his or her Extra Deferral
Account, DCP Account, Restoration Account, and his or her Executive SSP+ Company Contribution Account
immediately, regardless of whether benefit payments have commenced, to the extent that the Participant or
Beneficiary incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency. A Participant or Beneficiary may not receive a distribution of his or
her DC SERP Account solely in the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, even if fully vested.

The amount of the distribution will be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need,
including any taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution, as determined by the
Administrator.

31

6.2

Death Benefits

If a Participant dies before his or her entire Account has been distributed, the remaining balance will be distributed to his or
her Beneficiary in accordance with the Participant’s election or deemed election as to form and timing filed with the
Administrator with regard to such Account(s). Distributions to the Beneficiary will be made at the same time (or as soon as
practicable following the Company’s receipt of a notice of the Participant’s death) and in the same form as the payment that
otherwise would have been made to the Participant.

If a Beneficiary dies after the Participant, but before receiving the payment of all amounts due hereunder, then the unpaid
amounts will be paid to the individual(s) designated (in accordance with the rules established by the Administrator) by the
Beneficiary as his or her beneficiary(ies), or if no such designation has been made (or if such individual(s) do(es) not survive
to receive payment), then such unpaid amounts will be paid to the Beneficiary’s estate, in a single lump sum, as soon as
practicable after the Beneficiary’s death.

32

6.3

Rehires and Authorized Periods of Absence/Reduced Level of Services

This Section 6.3 addresses the form and timing of payment for a Participant who is rehired by the Company following a
Separation from Service, or who remains employed after a Separation from Service has occurred (for example, due to an
extended Authorized Period of Absence or due to reduced level of services).

In the event that a Participant forfeits a nonvested DC SERP Account upon a Separation from Service, this benefit will not be
restored upon rehire. This rule applies regardless of whether the Participant satisfies the vesting criteria under Section 5.5
following rehire.

(A)

After Commencing Benefits

This subsection (A) applies to a Participant who has received or begun receiving benefits under the Plan because he
or she has experienced a Separation from Service and has attained the specified age (if applicable).

(i)

Rehires. Installment payments that commenced prior to the Participant’s rehire with respect to Participant
Deferrals made and Company Contributions received before the Participant’s Separation from Service (“Old
Account”) will not be suspended by reason of the Participant’s rehire. This Old Account will continue to be
paid until exhausted, without regard to the period of rehire.

Participant Deferrals made and Company Contributions received attributable to periods after the date of rehire
(“New Account”) will remain subject to the Participant’s earlier distribution election or deemed election as to
the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(D) (subject to the change rules in Section 6.1(F)), without
regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire. As a result, the New Account will be
distributed in January following the Participant’s Separation from Service after rehire (subject to any 6-month
delay for Specified Employees), in the form selected under the original distribution election or deemed
election. This is because the Participant already has attained the specified age under Section 6.1(D) but has not
yet experienced a Separation from Service attributable to the New Account.

(ii)

Authorized Period of Absence/Reduced Level of Services. To the extent a Participant made additional
Participant Deferrals or received additional Company Contributions while on an Authorized Period of
Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services that constituted a Separation from Service under
Code section 409A, such Participant Deferrals made and Company Contributions received (to the extent
vested) will be distributed in January of the first Plan Year following the year in which they are made, in
accordance with the Participant’s earlier distribution election or deemed election. This is because the
Participant has already satisfied the conditions for payment under Section 6.1(D); namely, he or she has
attained the specified age and has experienced a Separation from Service attributable to such Participant
Deferrals made and contributions received.

33

(B)

Before Commencing Benefits

This subsection (B) applies to a Participant who has not begun receiving benefits under the Plan.

(i)

(ii)

Rehires. The rehired Participant’s Old Account, to the extent vested, will be distributed in accordance with the
Participant’s earlier distribution election or deemed election as to the timing and form of payment under
Section 6.1(D) (subject to the change rules in Section 6.1(F)). This means that, for example, if the
Participant’s original distribution election selected benefits in the form of a lump sum (or installments)
payable in January following attainment of a specified age under Section 6.1(D), then the Participant’s Old
Account (to the extent vested) will be payable as a lump sum (or installments, if so elected) in January
following the year in which he or she attains the specified age, even if the Participant has not had a subsequent
Separation from Service after rehire. This result will not change in the event that the Participant attains the
specified age after the initial Separation from Service, but is rehired before benefits actually begin.

The Participant’s New Account will remain subject to the Participant’s earlier distribution election or deemed
election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(D) (subject to the change rules in
Section 6.1(F)), without regard to any Separation from Service that occurred prior to rehire, as described in
Section 6.3(A) above. As a result, the New Account will be distributed either (i) in January following the
Participant’s Separation from Service after rehire, or (ii) in January following both the Participant’s
Separation from Service after rehire and after attainment of the specified age, in accordance with the original
distribution election or deemed election. This is because the Participant has not yet experienced a Separation
from Service attributable to the New Account.

Authorized Period of Absence/Reduced Level of Services. Any Participant Deferrals made or Company
Contributions received during an Authorized Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services (to
the extent vested) will be distributed in accordance with the Participant’s earlier distribution election or
deemed election as to the timing and form of payment under Section 6.1(D) (subject to the change rules in
Section 6.1(F)). This means that, for example, if the Participant’s original distribution election selected
benefits in the form of a lump sum (or installments) payable in January following attainment of a specified age
under Section 6.1(D), then any Participant Deferrals made and contributions received during an Authorized
Period of Absence or a period of a reduced level of services will be payable as a lump sum (or installments, if
so elected) in January following the year in which he or she attains the specified age.

34

This result will not change in the event that the Participant attains the specified age while on an Authorized
Period of Absence or during a period of a reduced level of services, but resumes (or increases his or her level
of) services before benefits actually begin.

35

7.1

Participant Accounts

ARTICLE VII

Accounts

The Administrator will establish and maintain an Account for each Participant, for each period of employment. Solely for
this purpose, a period of employment will be treated as commencing upon a Participant’s eligibility for the Plan (following
hire or rehire as applicable) and ending with his or her Separation from Service.

Each Account will be credited with Participant Deferrals and Company Contributions for the relevant period of employment,
as well as Earnings Credits described in Section 7.2 below. Each Account will be reduced as payments are made.

In connection with the January 1, 2019 amendment and restatement of the Plan, there was a one-time transfer of certain
Restoration Benefit sub-accounts of certain participants from the Plan to The Boeing Company Supplemental Savings Plan
(the “SSP”) such that the opening account balances of such participants in the SSP on January 1, 2019 was equal to the
closing balance of such participants’ Restoration Accounts in the Plan on December 31, 2018. The affected participants were:
(A) each Employee (as defined in the SSP) who was an Eligible Employee (as defined in the SSP) on January 1, 2019, and
was a participant in the Restoration Benefit of the Plan prior to 2019 and (B) each other current or former Employee (as
defined in the SSP) who was not as of January 1, 2019 and had never been on the E-Series Payroll (as such term is defined in
the Plan).

7.2

Earnings Credits

A Participant’s Account(s) will be credited, at the Participant’s (or, if applicable, Beneficiary’s) election, with earnings under
one or more of the following, as the individual elects and subject to any rules or limitations as may be imposed by the
Administrator: (i) the Interest Fund method, (ii) the Boeing Stock Fund method, or (iii) the Other Investment Funds method,
each as described below. In the absence of an election the Interest Fund method will be used.

(A)

Interest Fund Method

Under this method, a Participant’s Interest Fund method sub-account shall be adjusted daily in accordance with
changes in the unit value of the sub-account to reflect interest, based on the Participant’s sub-account balance.

Interest will be calculated for each Plan Year as the mean between the high and low (during the first eleven months of
the preceding Plan Year) of yields on AA-rated industrial bonds as reported by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.,
rounded to the nearest ¼th of one percent. Participants will be notified annually of the established interest rate.

(B)

Boeing Stock Fund Method

Under this method, a Participant’s Boeing Stock Fund sub-account shall be credited with the number of shares of the
common stock of The Boeing Company that could be purchased with the amount credited to such sub-account, based
on the Fair Market Value of the common stock of The Boeing Company on the day the sub-account is so credited (or
on the next business day on which the New York Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) is open, if the Exchange is closed
on the

36

day the sub-account is credited) excluding commissions, taxes, and other charges. Such number shall be recorded as
stock units in the Participant’s sub-account, for bookkeeping purposes only. For purposes of the Plan, “Fair Market
Value” means the closing price for the common stock of The Boeing Company as reported for the “New York Stock
Exchange - Composite Transactions” for a single trading day. The number of stock units in a sub-account shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, and other like adjustments in the common stock of The
Boeing Company.

Each Participant’s Boeing Stock Fund sub-account periodically shall be credited with the number of shares of the
common stock of The Boeing Company that could be purchased, as set forth in the preceding paragraph, with an
amount equal to the cash dividends that would be payable on the number of shares of the common stock of The
Boeing Company that equals the number of stock units in a Participant’s sub-account. The timing and methodology
will mirror the Boeing 401(k) dividend process. Participants will be notified annually of the number of stock units,
and the dividend equivalents, credited to their sub-account.

(C)

Other Investment Funds Method

Under this method, a Participant may choose to diversify his or her Other Investment Funds sub-account by electing
that it be credited (or charged) with the expenses, income, gains and losses on investment funds similar to those
offered under the Boeing 401(k) (excluding the Boeing Stock Fund and Stable Value Fund offered thereunder) as
designated by the Administrator from time to time, pursuant to an election by the Participant to have the Participant’s
sub-account credited as though the Participant had elected to invest in such funds in such increments as the
Participant will direct in accordance with rules established by the Administrator or its delegates; provided that the
Administrator may disregard such elections in its discretion.

Earnings credits to a Participant’s Account(s) may be subject to valuation adjustments in accordance with the procedures
established by the Administrator; provided, in no event will the portion of a Participant’s Account(s) that has been distributed
as of the time a valuation adjustment is made be subject to such valuation adjustment.

37

7.3

Investment Election Changes and Restrictions

A Participant may change how future additions to his or her Account(s) are deemed invested anytime during the Plan Year
subject to the Administrator’s rules and restrictions. The Participant may also transfer any portion of his or her sub-accounts
from one investment fund to another on a daily basis, provided that a Participant may not transfer funds from one investment
fund to another and back on the same day.

In addition, transfers cannot be made into the Boeing Stock Fund for 30 calendar days after transferring funds out of the
Boeing Stock Fund. This restriction applies regardless of the number of units or the dollar value of the transfer. However, the
Participant may continue to direct future additions into the Boeing Stock Fund and make transfers out of this investment fund
at any time, subject to insider trading rules.

7.4 Missing Participants and Improper Credits

A Participant’s Account may be forfeited or reduced upon the occurrence of one of the following events, even if 100%
vested:

(A)

The Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary to distribute amounts from his or her Account (a
“missing participant”).

(B)

The Administrator recaptures amounts improperly credited to a Participant’s Account.

See also Section 10.2 regarding anti-assignment and Section 10.3 regarding the unfunded nature of this Plan.

38

8.1

Plan Administration

ARTICLE VIII

Administration

The Plan shall be administered by the Administrator. The Administrator shall make such rules, interpretations,
determinations of fact and computations as it may deem appropriate, including (without limitation) requiring the use of an
electronic or telephonic system for purposes of Participant elections and designations. Any decision of the Administrator
with respect to the Plan, including (without limitation) any determination of eligibility to participate in the Plan and any
calculation of Plan benefits, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. The Administrator shall submit to the
Compensation Committee periodic reports covering the operation of the Plan.

8.2

Claims Procedure

The procedures for making claims for benefits under the Plan and for having the denial of a benefits claim reviewed shall be
the same as those procedures set forth in the Boeing 401(k), provided that the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors shall be substituted for the Administrator thereunder for purposes of the review of claims and appeals with respect
to benefits under the Plan for elected officers of the Company (other than determinations related to potential forfeiture or
reimbursement of benefits under Sections 5.5 or 5.7 of the Plan, which such determinations shall be made by the
Administrator).

See Section 10.8 regarding limitations on subsequent legal action.

39

ARTICLE IX

Amendment and Termination

The Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee, the Administrator, and their respective delegate or delegates shall each have
the authority to amend the Plan at any time, including, but not limited to, the authority to adopt amendments to combine or transfer
all or part of the Plan with or to other plans maintained by the Controlled Group (including a termination of the Plan for that
purpose) or to change the timing of eligibility for participation in the Plan; provided, however, that the Compensation Committee
shall have the exclusive authority to adopt any amendments or make any other changes to the Plan that change the rate or amount of
Company-provided benefits for employees on the E-Series Payroll. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to terminate the
Plan at any time.

In the event of Plan amendment or termination, a Participant’s benefits under the Plan shall not be less than the Plan benefits to
which the Participant would be entitled if the Participant had terminated employment immediately prior to such amendment or
termination of the Plan, increased or decreased by any Earnings Credits attributable to periods on or after the effective date of such
amendment or termination.

In general, upon the termination of the Plan with respect to any Participant, the affected Participants will not be entitled to receive a
distribution until the time specified in Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, The Boeing Company may, in its discretion,
terminate the entire Plan and pay each Participant a single lump-sum distribution of his or her entire accrued benefit to the extent
permitted under conditions set forth in Code section 409A and any IRS or Treasury guidance thereunder.

40

10.1 No Employment Rights

ARTICLE X

Miscellaneous

Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any person any right to remain in the employ of the Company or other member
of the Controlled Group, as applicable, or affect any right of the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as
applicable, to terminate a person’s employment with or without cause.

10.2 Anti-Assignment

No benefit under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, charge, execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other legal process. Any attempt to take such action shall
be void and shall authorize the Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, to forfeit all further right and interest in any
benefit under this Plan. In addition, a Participant’s Account may be reduced by the amount of any tax obligation paid by the
Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable, on behalf of a Participant, Beneficiary, or any other
person, if such individual fails to reimburse the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable, for such
obligation.

10.3 Unfunded Status of Plan

No funds shall be segregated or earmarked for or in the Account of any current or former Participant, Beneficiary or other
person under the Plan. However, the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable, may establish one or
more trusts to assist in meeting its obligations under the Plan, the assets of which shall be subject to the claims of the general
creditors of the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable. No current or former Participant,
Beneficiary or other person, individually or as a member of a group, shall have any right, title or interest in any account,
fund, grantor trust, or any asset that may be acquired by the Company or other member of the Controlled Group, as
applicable, in respect of its obligations under the Plan (other than as a general creditor of the Company or other member of
the Controlled Group, as applicable, with an unsecured claim against its general assets).

10.4 Delays or Acceleration in Payment

Payment of benefits under this Plan may be delayed or accelerated to the extent permitted by Code section 409A, as
determined by the Administrator.

10.5

Involuntary Inclusion in Income

If a determination is made that the Account of any Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) is subject to current income taxation
under Code section 409A, then the taxable portion of such Account will be immediately distributed to the Participant (or his
or her Beneficiary), notwithstanding the general timing rules otherwise described herein.

41

10.6 Compliance with Code Section 409A

It is intended that amounts deferred under this Plan will not be taxable under Code section 409A with respect to any
individual. All provisions of this Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with this intent.

10.7 Construction

The validity of the Plan or any of its provisions will be determined under and will be construed according to federal law and,
to the extent permissible, according to the internal laws of the state of Illinois. If any provision of the Plan is held illegal or
invalid for any reason, such determination will not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan and the Plan will be construed
and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included.

10.8 Legal Action

No legal action may be brought in court on a claim for benefits under the Plan after 180 days following the decision on
appeal (or 180 days following the expiration of the time to make an appeal decision if no appeal is made). The Plan, all
benefits awarded thereunder, and all determinations and other actions with respect thereto, shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Illinois without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, except to the extent preempted by the laws of the
United States.  Participants irrevocably consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts
located in the State of Illinois, Cook County.

10.9 Tax Withholding

The Company, or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable, has the right to deduct any federal, state, local or
foreign taxes that are required to be withheld from any payments made hereunder. In addition, if prior to the date of payment
of any amount hereunder, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Code Sections 3101, 3121(a)
and 3121(v)(2), where applicable, becomes due, then the Company, or other member of the Controlled Group, as applicable,
shall have the right to deduct such tax from any other payments made to the Participant or direct that the Participant’s
Account be reduced by the amount needed to pay the Participant’s portion of such tax, plus an amount equal to the
withholding taxes due under federal, state or local law resulting from the payment of such FICA tax, and an additional
amount to pay the additional income tax at source on wages attributable to the pyramiding of the Code section 3401 wages
and taxes, but no greater than the aggregate of the FICA tax amount and the income tax withholding related to such FICA tax
amount. Each Participant shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any benefits under the
Plan that exceed the amounts withheld.

10.10 Liability for Benefit Payments

The obligation to pay or provide for payment of a benefit hereunder to any Participant or Beneficiary shall be the sole and
exclusive liability and responsibility of the employer which employed the Participant during the period which contributions
were made, unless another entity has specifically assumed such liability. No other affiliate or subsidiary of such employer
shall be liable or responsible for such payment, and nothing in the Plan shall be construed as creating or imposing any joint
or shared liability for any such payment. The fact that a company other than the employer actually makes one or more
payments to a Participant or Beneficiary shall not be deemed a waiver of this provision;

42

rather, any such payment shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of and for the account of the employer.

10.11 Recovery of Plan Overpayments

The Plan shall have the right to offset from any future benefit payments due hereunder to (or with respect to) such individual
the amount of such excess in such manner as the Administrator determines in its sole discretion or, if such offset is not
possible, the Administrator may undertake such actions as it deems reasonable to recover the excess.

10.12 Notice

Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or
sent by registered or certified mail, to (a) The Boeing Company’s headquarters, with attention to the Secretary of the
Company, if the notice or filing is to be made to the Administrator or the Company or (b) the Participant’s or Beneficiary’s
address on file with the Company, if the notice or filing is to be made to such individual. Such notice shall be deemed given
as of the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration
or certification.

43

APPENDIX A
List of Excluded Entities

[Reserved.]

This Appendix A may be updated by the Administrator from time to time without the need for a formal amendment to the Plan.

A-1

APPENDIX B
Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company

The provisions of this Appendix B apply to DCP Accounts and individuals who were participants in the DCP as of December 31,
2021. In the event of a conflict between this Appendix B and the other provisions of the Plan, the provisions in this Appendix B shall
control.

No DCP Deferrals were made to the DCP with respect to Base Pay earned and paid on and after January 1, 2019, Annual Incentive
Awards with performance periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, or Performance Awards with grant dates on or after
January 1, 2019.

Effective with respect to amounts deferred on or after January 1, 2006 (including amounts for which Deferral Elections were made
prior to January 1, 2006) the Company no longer provided any DCP Matching Contributions on any DCP Deferrals into a Boeing
Stock Fund account; provided that in the case of DCP Deferrals that were the subject of a deferral election into a Boeing Stock Fund
account made prior to January 1, 2005, the Company continued to match such DCP Deferrals of Boeing Stock Units and
Performance Share Awards that are not yet vested (upon vesting) and such DCP Deferrals of 2005 Annual Incentive Awards that
were paid in 2006. To the extent that the Company previously a DCP Matching Contribution with respect to all or part of any
amounts previously deferred under the DCP, each such DCP Matching Contribution was deferred together with the Deferral to
which it relates, and is subject to all of the Participant elections (including default elections) with respect to such Deferral.

Forfeiture and Reinstatement of Matching Contributions

(A)

(B)

Any DCP Matching Contribution shall be canceled and forfeited if the Participant Separates from Service for any
reason other than retirement under a retirement plan sponsored by the Company, disability as determined by the
Company, layoff, or death. The forfeited DCP Matching Contribution (and any Earnings Credits that would have
accrued but for the forfeiture) will be reinstated upon rehire, only where (i) the Participant’s Separation from Service
occurred while the Participant was on an Authorized Period of Absence or due to a reasonably anticipated permanent
reduction in the level of services performed by the Participant to less than 50 percent of the average level of services
performed by the Participant during the immediately preceding 36-month period, and (ii) the Participant’s Separation
from Service was deemed a Separation from Service under Code section 409A or the terms of this Plan (i.e., the
Participant did not incur a termination of employment with the Controlled Group).

Reinstatement of the Participant’s forfeited benefits will occur upon (i) return to active employment with the
Company within the Authorized Period of Absence, (ii) termination of the Authorized Period of Absence or period of
a reduced level of services due to retirement under a plan sponsored by the Company, disability as determined by the
Company, layoff or death, or (iii) the Participant’s return to active employment at a level of services that is 50 percent
or more of the average level of services performed by the Participant prior to his or her prior deemed Separation from
Service due to a reduction in services. Such reinstated benefits will remain subject to the forfeiture provisions of the
first sentence of section 1(A) the payment timing rules under Section 3(A) hereof.

defined  under  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  listing  standards  and  a  “nonemployee  director”  as  defined  in  Rule  16b-3  promulgated  under  the
Exchange  Act.  However,  the  fact  that  a  Committee  member  shall  fail  to  qualify  under  the  foregoing  requirements  shall  not  invalidate  any  Award
made by the Committee which is otherwise validly made under the Plan.

3.2 Delegation by Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee may delegate responsibility for administering the Plan
with  respect  to  designated  classes  of  eligible  persons  to  different  committees  consisting  of  one  or  more  members  of  the  Board,  subject  to  such
limitations  as  the  Board  or  the  Compensation  Committee  deems  appropriate,  except  with  respect  to  benefits  to  nonemployee  directors  and  to
officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Members of any committee shall serve for such term as the Board may determine, subject to
removal by the Board at any time. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Board or the Committee may authorize one or more officers of
the  Company  to  grant  Awards  to  designated  classes  of  eligible  persons,  within  limits  specifically  prescribed  by  the  Board  or  the  Committee;
provided, however, that no such officer shall have or obtain authority to grant Awards to himself or herself or to any officer subject to Section 16 of
the Exchange Act. All references in the Plan to the “Committee” shall be, as applicable, to the Compensation Committee, the Governance & Public
Policy Committee or any other committee or any officer to whom the Board or the Compensation Committee has delegated authority to administer
the Plan.

3.3 Administration and Interpretation by Committee. Except for the terms and conditions explicitly set forth in the Plan, the Committee shall have
full power and exclusive authority, subject to such orders or resolutions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as may from time to time be
adopted by the Board, to (a) select the eligible persons as set forth in Section 5 to whom Awards may from time to time be granted under the Plan;
(b) determine the type or types of Award to be granted under the Plan; (c) determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each
Award granted under the Plan; (d) determine the terms and conditions of any Award granted under the Plan; (e) approve the forms of agreements
for  use  under the Plan;  (f)  determine  whether,  to  what extent  and under  what circumstances  Awards  may  be settled  in cash,  shares  of  Common
Stock or other property or canceled or suspended; (g) determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances cash, shares of Common
Stock, other property and other amounts payable with respect to an Award shall be deferred either automatically or at the election of the Participant,
subject  to  Section  409A  and  in  accordance  with  Section  6.3;  (h)  interpret  and  administer  the  Plan  and  any  instrument  or  agreement  entered  into
under the Plan; (i) establish such rules and regulations  and appoint such agents as it shall deem appropriate  for the proper administration  of the
Plan; (j) delegate ministerial duties to such of the Company’s officers as it so determines; (k) amend Section 16.1 in order to comply with Section
10D of the Exchange Act (as determined by the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission); and (l) make any other determination and take any other action that the Committee deems necessary or desirable for
administration of the Plan. Decisions of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, any Participant,
any shareholder and any eligible person. A majority of the members of the Committee may determine its actions and fix the time and place of its
meetings.

Section 5. Eligibility

Section 6. Awards

6.1 Form and Grant of Awards. The Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to determine the type or types of Awards to be
granted under the Plan. Such Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to or in tandem with any other type of Award.

6.2 Evidence  of  Awards.  Awards  granted  under  the  Plan  shall  be  evidenced  by  a  written  instrument  that  shall  contain  such  terms,  conditions,
limitations and restrictions as the Committee shall deem advisable and that are not inconsistent with the Plan.

6.3 Deferrals. The Committee may permit a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of any Award. If any such deferral election is permitted, the
Committee, in its sole discretion, shall establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals, which may include the grant of additional Awards
or provisions for the payment or crediting of interest or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits to deferred stock unit equivalents. The
value of the payment so deferred may be allocated to a deferred account established for a Participant under any deferred compensation plan of the
Company  designated  by  the  Committee.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  deferral  made  under  this  Section  6.3  will  be  made  under  a  deferred
compensation plan of the Company or pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement, either of which satisfies the requirements for exemption
from or complies with Section 409A.

6.4 Dividends and Distributions. Participants holding Awards may, if the Committee so determines, be credited with dividends paid with respect to
the underlying  shares  or dividend  equivalents  while the  Awards  are so  held in  a manner  determined  by the Committee  in its  sole  discretion.  The
Committee may apply any restrictions to the dividends or dividend equivalents that the Committee deems appropriate. The Committee, in its sole
discretion, may determine the form of payment of dividends or dividend equivalents, including cash, shares of Common Stock, Restricted Stock or
Stock Units. Dividends and dividend equivalents that may be paid under any awards outstanding under the Old Plan as of the Shareholder Approval
Effective Date shall be granted pursuant to Section 11 below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the right to any dividends or dividend equivalents
declared and paid on the number of shares underlying an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right may not be contingent, directly or indirectly on the
exercise of the Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, and an Award providing a right to dividends or dividend equivalents declared and paid on the
number of shares underlying an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, the payment of which is not contingent upon, or otherwise payable on, the
exercise of the Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, must comply with or qualify for an exemption under Section 409A and (b) dividend equivalents
credited in connection with an Award that vests based on the achievement of Performance Goals shall be subject to restrictions and risk of forfeiture
to the same extent as the Award with respect to which such dividend equivalents have been credited.

7.1 Grant of Options. The Committee may grant Options designated as Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options.

7.2  Option  Exercise  Price;  Repricing  Prohibition.  The  exercise  price  for  shares  purchased  under  an  Option  shall  be  as  determined  by  the
Committee,  but  shall  not  be  less  than  100%  of  the  Fair  Market  Value  of  the  Common  Stock  for  the  Grant  Date,  except  in  the  case  of  Substitute
Awards.  In  no  event  shall  the  Committee,  without  the  prior  approval  of  the  Company’s  shareholders,  (a)  cancel  any  outstanding  Option  for  the
purpose of reissuing the Option to the Participant  at a lower exercise price, (b) exchange any outstanding Option for cash, another Award, or an
Option or Stock Appreciation Right with an exercise or

Section 7. Options

5

grant price that is less than the exercise price of the cancelled Option, (c) reduce the exercise price of an outstanding Option, or (d) take any other
action that would be a “repricing” of the Option.

7.3  Term  of  Options.  Subject  to  earlier  termination  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Plan  and  the  instrument  evidencing  the  Option,  the
maximum term of an Option shall be ten years from the Grant Date.

7.4  Exercise  of  Options.  The  Committee  shall  establish  and  set  forth  in  each  instrument  that  evidences  an  Option  the  time  at  which,  or  the
installments in which, the Option shall vest and become exercisable, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any
time.

To  the  extent  an  Option  has  vested  and  become  exercisable,  the  Option  may  be  exercised  in  whole  or  from  time  to  time  in  part  by  delivery  as
directed by the Company to the Company or a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company of a written stock option exercise agreement
or notice, in a form and in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, setting forth the number of shares with respect to which the
Option is being exercised, the restrictions imposed on the shares purchased under such exercise agreement, if any, and such representations and
agreements as may be required by the Committee, accompanied by payment in full as described in Section 7.5. An Option may be exercised only
for whole shares and may not be exercised for less than a reasonable number of shares at any one time, as determined by the Committee.

7.5 Payment of Exercise Price. The exercise price for shares purchased under an Option shall be paid in full as directed by the Company to the
Company or a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company by delivery of consideration equal to the product of the Option exercise price
and the number of shares purchased. Such consideration must be paid before the Company will issue the shares being purchased and must be in a
form or a combination of forms acceptable to the Committee for that purchase, which forms may include: (a) check; (b) wire transfer; (c) tendering by
attestation shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant that on the day prior to the exercise date have a Fair Market Value equal to
the aggregate exercise price of the shares being purchased under the Option; (d) to the extent permitted by applicable law, delivery of a properly
executed exercise notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company to deliver promptly to
the Company the aggregate amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the Option exercise price and any tax withholding obligations that may arise in
connection with the exercise, all in accordance with the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board; or (e) such other consideration as the Committee
may permit in its sole discretion.

7.6 Post-Termination Exercise. The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option whether the Option shall
continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, after a Termination of Service, any of which provisions may be waived or
modified by the Committee  at any time, provided that any such waiver or modification  shall satisfy  the requirements  for exemption under Section
409A.

7.7 Incentive Stock Options. The terms of any Incentive Stock Options shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code,
or any successor provision, and any regulations promulgated thereunder. Individuals who are not employees of the Company or one of its parent or
subsidiary corporations (as such terms are defined for purposes of Section 422 of the Code) may not be granted Incentive Stock Options. To the
extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a
Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000 or, if different, the maximum limitation in effect at the time of grant under the Code (the Fair
Market  Value  being  determined  as  of  the  Grant  Date  for  the  Option),  such  portion  in  excess  of  $100,000  shall  be  treated  as  Nonqualified  Stock
Options. No Incentive Stock Options may be granted more than ten years after the adoption in February 2014 of this amended and restated Plan by
the Board.

Section 8. Stock Appreciation Rights

8.1 Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights; SAR Grant Price. The Committee  may grant stock appreciation rights (“Stock  Appreciation Rights” or
“SARs”). A SAR may be granted in tandem with an Option or alone (“freestanding”). The grant price of a tandem SAR shall be equal to the exercise
price of the related Option, and the grant price of a freestanding SAR shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the Grant
Date, except for Substitute Awards. A SAR may be exercised upon such terms and conditions and for the term as the Committee determines in its
sole discretion; provided, however, that, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the instrument evidencing the
SAR, the term of a freestanding SAR shall be a term not to exceed ten years from the Grant Date as established for that SAR by the Committee or,
if not so established, shall be ten years, and in the case of a tandem SAR, (a) the term shall not exceed the term of the related Option and (b) the
tandem SAR may be exercised for all or part of the shares subject to the related Option upon the

6

surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option, except that the tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the
shares for which its related Option is then exercisable.

8.2 Payment  of  SAR Amount.  Upon  the  exercise  of  a  SAR,  a  Participant  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  payment  from  the  Company  in  an  amount
determined by multiplying (a) the difference between the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock for the date of exercise over the grant price by (b)
the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon exercise of a SAR may be
in cash, in shares of equivalent value, in some combination thereof or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion.

8.3 Post-Termination Exercise. The  Committee  shall  establish  and  set  forth  in  each  instrument  that  evidences  a  freestanding  SAR  whether  the
SAR shall continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, after a Termination of Service, any of which provisions may be
waived or modified by the Committee at any time, provided that any such waiver or modification shall satisfy the requirements for exemption under
Section 409A.

8.4 Repricing Prohibition. In no event shall the Committee, without the prior approval of the Company’s shareholders, (a) cancel any outstanding
SAR for the purpose of reissuing the SAR to the Participant at a lower grant price, (b) exchange any outstanding SAR for cash, another Award, or
an Option or Stock Appreciation Right with an exercise or grant price that is less than the grant price of the cancelled SAR, (c) reduce the grant price
of an outstanding SAR, or (d) take any other action that would be a “repricing” of the SAR.

Section 9. Restricted Stock and Stock Units

9.1 Grant of Restricted Stock and Stock Units. The Committee may grant Restricted Stock and Stock Units on such terms and conditions and
subject  to  such  forfeiture  restrictions,  if  any  (which  may  be  based  on  continuous  service  with  the  Company  or  a  Related  Company  or  the
achievement of any Performance Goals), as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion, which terms, conditions and restrictions shall be
set forth in the instrument evidencing the Award.

9.2 Issuance of Shares. Upon the satisfaction of any terms, conditions and restrictions prescribed with respect to Restricted Stock or Stock Units,
or upon a Participant’s release from any terms, conditions and restrictions of Restricted Stock or Stock Units, as determined by the Committee, (a)
the shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Award of Restricted Stock shall become freely transferable by the Participant, and (b) Stock Units
shall be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock as the Committee shall determine in its sole
discretion.

9.3 Waiver of Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may waive the repurchase or
forfeiture period and any other terms, conditions or restrictions on any Restricted Stock or Stock Unit under such circumstances and subject to such
terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.

Section 10. Performance Shares, Performance Restricted Stock
or Units, and Performance Units

10.1 Grant  of  Performance  Shares  and  Performance  Restricted  Stock  or  Units.  The  Committee  may  grant  Awards  of  performance  shares,
performance  restricted  stock  and  performance  restricted  stock  units  (“Performance  Shares,  “Performance  Restricted  Stock”  or  “Performance
Restricted Stock Units”, as the case may be) and designate the Participants to whom Performance Shares or Performance Restricted Stock or Units
are  to  be  awarded  and  determine  the  number  of  Performance  Shares  or  Performance  Restricted  Stock  or  Units,  the  length  of  the  Performance
Period and the other terms and conditions of each such Award. Each Award of Performance Shares or Performance Restricted Stock or Units shall
entitle  the  Participant  to  a  payment  in  the  form  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  upon  the  achievement  of  Performance  Goals  and  other  terms  and
conditions specified by the Committee. Notwithstanding the achievement of any Performance Goals, the number of shares issued under an Award
of Performance Shares or Performance Restricted Stock or Units may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall
determine in its sole discretion.  The Committee, in its sole discretion,  may make a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock otherwise required to be issued to a Participant pursuant to an Award of Performance Shares or Performance Restricted Stock or Units.

10.2 Grant of Performance Units. The Committee may grant Awards of performance units (“Performance Units”) and designate the Participants to
whom Performance Units are to be awarded and determine the number of Performance Units, the length of the Performance Period and the other
terms and conditions of each such Award. Each Award of Performance Units shall entitle the Participant to a payment in cash upon the achievement
of Performance Goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee. Notwithstanding the achievement of any Performance Goals, the
amount to be paid

7

under  an  Award  of  Performance  Units  may  be  adjusted  on  the  basis  of  such  further  consideration  as  the  Committee  shall  determine  in  its  sole
discretion. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may substitute shares of Common Stock for the cash payment otherwise required to be made to a
Participant pursuant to a Performance Unit.

In  addition  to  the  Awards  described  in  Sections  7  through  10,  and  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Plan,  the  Committee  may  grant  other  incentives
payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock under the Plan as it determines to be in the best interests of the Company and subject to such other
terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, including dividends and dividend equivalents that may be paid under any awards outstanding under
the Old Plan as of the Shareholder Approval Effective Date.

Section 11. Other Stock or Cash-Based Awards

Section 12. Withholding

The Company may require a Participant to pay to the Company the amount of (a) any tax withholding obligations and (b) any amounts due from the
Participant to the Company or to any Related Company (“other obligations”). The Company shall not be required to issue any shares of Common
Stock under the Plan until such tax withholding obligations and other obligations are satisfied.

The Committee may permit or require a Participant to satisfy all or part of his or her tax withholding obligations and other obligations by (a) paying
cash to the Company, (b) having the Company withhold an amount from any cash amounts otherwise due or to become due from the Company to
the  Participant,  (c)  having  the  Company  withhold  a  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  that  would  otherwise  be  issued  to  the  Participant  (or
become vested in the case of Restricted Stock or Performance Restricted Stock) having a Fair Market Value equal to the tax withholding obligations
and  other  obligations,  or  (d)  surrendering  a  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  the  Participant  already  owns  having  a  value  equal  to  the  tax
withholding obligations and other obligations.

Section 13. Assignability

No Award or Award agreement, and no rights or interests herein or therein, shall or may be assigned, transferred, sold, exchanged, encumbered,
pledged, or otherwise hypothecated or disposed of by a Participant or any beneficiary(ies) of any Participant, except (a) by testamentary disposition
by the Participant or the laws of intestate succession and (b) that to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its sole discretion, a Participant may
designate one or more beneficiaries on a Company-approved form who may receive payment under an Award after the Participant’s death. No such
interest shall be subject to execution, attachment or similar legal process, including, without limitation, seizure for the payment of the Participant’s
debts,  judgments,  alimony,  or  separate  maintenance.  Except  as  provided  in  this  Section  13,  during  the  lifetime  of  a  Participant,  Awards  are
exercisable only by the Participant or his or her legal representative in the case of physical or mental incapacitation of the Participant as evidenced
by legal order.

Section 14. Adjustments

14.1 No  Corporate  Action  Restriction.  The  existence  of  the  Plan,  any  Award  agreement  and/or  the  Awards  granted  hereunder  shall  not  limit,
affect  or  restrict  in  any  way  the  right  or  power  of  the  Board  or  the  shareholders  of  the  Company  to  make  or  authorize  (a)  any  adjustment,
recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company’s or any subsidiary’s capital structure or its business, (b) any merger, consolidation
or  change  in  the  ownership  of  the  Company  or  any  subsidiary,  (c)  any  issue  of  bonds,  debentures,  capital,  preferred  or  prior  preference  stocks
ahead of or affecting the Company’s or any subsidiary’s capital stock or the rights thereof, (d) any dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any
subsidiary,  (e)  any  sale  or  transfer  of  all  or  any  part  of  the  Company’s  or  any  subsidiary’s  assets  or  business,  or  (f)  any  other  corporate  act  or
proceeding  by  the  Company  or  any  subsidiary.  No  Participant,  beneficiary  or  any  other  person  shall  have  any  claim  against  any  member  of  the
Board or the Committee, the Company or any subsidiary, or any employees, officers, shareholders or agents of the Company or any subsidiary, as a
result of any such action.

14.2 Recapitalization Adjustments. In the event of a dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other securities, or
other  property)  other  than  regular  cash  dividends,  recapitalization,  stock  split,  reverse  stock  split,  reorganization,  merger,  consolidation,  split-up,
spin-off, combination, change in control or exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or other corporate transaction or event
affects the Common Stock such that an adjustment is necessary or appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential
benefits  intended  to  be  made  available  under  the  Plan,  the  Board  shall  equitably  adjust  (a)  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  other
securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or property) with respect

8

to  which  Awards  may  be  granted,  (b)  the  maximum  share  limitation  applicable  to  each  type  of  Award  that  may  be  granted  to  any  individual
Participant  in  any  calendar  year,  (c)  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  other  securities  of  the  Company  (or  number  and  kind  of  other
securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and (d) the exercise price with respect to any Option or the grant price with respect to any
Stock Appreciation Right.

14.3 Corporate  Transactions.  If  the  Company  enters  into  or  is  involved  in  any  Corporate  Transaction,  the  Board  may,  prior  to  such  Corporate
Transaction  and  effective  upon  such  Corporate  Transaction,  take  such  action  as  it  deems  appropriate,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  replacing
outstanding Awards with Substitute Awards in respect of the shares, other securities or other property of the surviving corporation or any affiliate of
the surviving corporation on such terms  and conditions, as to the number of shares, pricing and otherwise, which shall substantially preserve the
value,  rights  and  benefits  of  any  affected  Awards  granted  hereunder  as  of  the  date  of  the  consummation  of  the  Corporate  Transaction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if any Corporate Transaction occurs, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to cancel each Participant’s Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights and to pay to each affected Participant in connection with the cancellation of
such Participant’s Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Corporate Transaction Price (as defined
below),  as  determined  by  the  Board,  of  the  Common  Stock  underlying  any  unexercised  Options  or  Stock  Appreciation  Rights  (whether  then
exercisable  or  not)  over  the  aggregate  exercise  price  of  such  unexercised  Options  and/or  Stock  Appreciation  Rights,  and  make  additional
adjustments and/or settlements of other outstanding Awards as it determines to be fair and equitable to affected Participants. Upon receipt by any
affected Participant of any such Substitute Award (or payment) as a result of any such Corporate Transaction, such Participant’s affected Awards for
which  such  Substitute  Awards  (or  payment)  were  received  shall  be  thereupon  cancelled  without  the  need  for  obtaining  the  consent  of  any  such
affected Participant.

Subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  preceding  paragraph,  the  Board  shall  not  take  any  further  action  that  causes  any  Awards,  which  are  not  then
exercisable and vested, to automatically become vested and exercisable in connection with a Corporate Transaction under this Section 14.3.

For purposes of the Plan,

(a) “Corporate Transaction” means the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
of  the  Exchange  Act)  becomes  the  “beneficial  owner”  (as  defined  in  Rule  13d-3  of  the  Exchange  Act),  directly  or  indirectly,  of  securities  of  the
Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the Company’s then-outstanding voting securities; (ii) the
consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; (iii) the consummation of a merger or
consolidation  of  the  Company  with  any  other  corporation,  other  than  a  merger  or  consolidation  which  would  result  in  the  voting  securities  of  the
Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities
of the surviving entity or its parent) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such
surviving entity or its parent outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation or (iv) individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the
Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a
director  subsequent  to  the  date  hereof  whose  election,  or  nomination  for  election  by  the  Company’s  shareholders,  was  approved  by  a  vote  of  at
least  a  majority  of  the  directors  then  comprising  the  Incumbent  Board  shall  be  considered  as  though  such  individual  were  a  member  of  the
Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened
election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of
a person other than the Board.

(b) “Corporate Transaction Price” means the highest price per share of Common Stock paid in any transaction related to a Corporate Transaction.
To the extent that the consideration paid in any Corporate Transaction consists all or in part of securities or other non-cash consideration, the value
of such securities or other non-cash consideration shall be determined in the good-faith discretion of the Board consistent with provisions of Section
409A and/or other applicable law.

Section 15. Amendment and Termination

15.1 Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan. The Board or the Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any
portion of the Plan at any time and in such respects as it shall deem advisable; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law,
regulation or stock exchange rule, shareholder approval shall be required for any amendment to the Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an amendment that constitutes a “material revision,” as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange shall
be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval. In

9

addition,  any  revision  that  deletes  or  limits  the  scope  of  the  provisions  in  Sections  7.2  and  8.4  prohibiting  repricing  of  Options  or  SARs  without
shareholder approval and any revision that increases the number of shares stated in Section 4.1 as available for issuance under the Plan shall be
considered material revisions that require shareholder approval.

15.2 Term of the Plan. Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate ten years from the Shareholder Approval Effective
Date. After the Plan is terminated, no future Awards may be granted, but Awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with
their  applicable  terms  and  conditions  and  the  Plan’s  terms  and  conditions.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no  Incentive  Stock  Options  may  be
granted more than ten years after the adoption in February 2014 of this amended and restated Plan by the Board.

15.3 Consent  of  Participant.  The  amendment,  suspension  or  termination  of  the  Plan  or  a  portion  thereof  or  the  amendment  of  an  outstanding
Award  shall  not,  without  the  Participant’s  consent,  materially  adversely  affect  any  rights  under  any  Award  theretofore  granted  to  the  Participant
under the Plan. Any change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall not, without the consent of the Participant, be made in a
manner so as to constitute a “modification” that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to Section 14 shall not be subject to these restrictions.

Section 16. General

16.1 Clawbacks. Awards under the Plan shall be subject to the Clawback Policy as adopted by the Board and as amended from time to time. In
addition,  subject  to  applicable  local  law,  or  except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  pursuant  to  an  applicable  Award  agreement,  Awards  granted
under the Plan shall be subject to clawback and forfeiture (meaning that the Award must be promptly returned to the Company if already distributed,
or  that  a  Participant  will  lose  his  or  her  entitlement  to  an  Award  if  it  has  not  yet  been  distributed)  in  the  event  a  Participant  or  former  Participant
engages in any of the following conduct, as determined by the Company or its delegate in its sole discretion, prior to the second anniversary of the
later of the vesting or receipt of payment of the Award: the Participant (i) pleads or admits to, is convicted of, or is otherwise found guilty of a criminal
or indictable offense involving theft, fraud, embezzlement, or other similar unlawful acts against the Company or against the Company’s interests; (ii)
directly  or  indirectly  engages  in  competition  with  any  aspect  of  Company  business  with  which  the  Participant  was  involved  or  about  which  the
Participant gained Company proprietary or confidential information;  (iii) induces or attempts to induce, directly or indirectly, any of the Company’s
employees, representatives or consultants to terminate, discontinue or cease working with or for the Company, or to breach any contract with the
Company, in order to work with or for, or enter into a contract with, the Participant or any third party; (iv) disparages or defames the Company,its
products, or its current or former employees, provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit any individual from reporting, in good faith,
suspected  unlawful  conduct  in  the  workplace;  or  (v)  takes,  misappropriates,  uses,  or  discloses  Company  proprietary  or  confidential  information.
Clawback can, if applicable and where permitted by applicable local law, be made by deducting payments that will be due in the future (including
salary,  bonuses,  and  other  forms  of  compensation).  A  Participant’s  acceptance  of  an  Award  under  the  Plan  shall  constitute  such  Participant’s
acknowledgement  and  recognition  that  the  Participant’s  compliance  with  this  Section  is  a  condition  for  the  Participant’s  receipt  of  the  Award.  For
purposes of this Section, the Company shall include the Company and all Related Companies.

Nothing  in  this  Section  16.1  will  apply  to  legally  protected  communications  to  government  agencies  or  statements  made  in  the  course  of  sworn
testimony in administrative, judicial or arbitral proceedings.

16.2 No Individual Rights. No individual or Participant  shall have any claim  to be granted  any Award under the  Plan, and the Company  has no
obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.

Furthermore,  nothing  in  the  Plan  or  any  Award  granted  under  the  Plan  shall  be  deemed  to  constitute  an  employment  contract  or  confer  or  be
deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related
Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate a Participant’s employment or other relationship at any
time, with or without cause.

16.3 Issuance of Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of
Common  Stock  under  the  Plan  or  make  any  other  distribution  of  benefits  under  the  Plan  unless,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Company’s  counsel,  such
issuance,  delivery  or  distribution  would  comply  with  all  applicable  laws  (including,  without  limitation,  the  requirements  of  the  Securities  Act  or  the
laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction) and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.

10

The Company shall be under no obligation to any Participant to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, or
to register or qualify under the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued
under,  or  created  by,  the  Plan,  or  to  continue  in  effect  any  such  registrations  or  qualifications  if  made.  The  Company  may  issue  certificates  for
shares with such legends and subject to such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the Company deems necessary or
desirable  for  compliance  by  the  Company  with  federal,  state  and  foreign  securities  laws.  The  Company  may  also  require  such  other  action  or
agreement by the Participants as may from time to time be necessary to comply with applicable securities laws.

To  the  extent  the  Plan  or  any  instrument  evidencing  an  Award  provides  for  issuance  of  stock  certificates  to  reflect  the  issuance  of  shares  of
Common Stock, the issuance may be effected on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any
stock exchange.

16.4 Indemnification. Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of the
Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Section 3 shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from
any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim,
action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act
under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company’s approval, or paid by him or
her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she shall give the
Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend such claim, action, suit or proceeding before he or she undertakes to handle and
defend the same on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except as
expressly provided by statute.

The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the
Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or of any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or
hold them harmless.

16.5  No  Rights  as  a  Shareholder.  Unless  otherwise  provided  by  the  Committee  or  in  the  instrument  evidencing  the  Award  or  in  a  written
employment or services agreement, no Option or Award denominated in units shall entitle the Participant to any cash dividend, voting or other right
of a shareholder unless and until the date of issuance under the Plan of the shares that are the subject of such Award.

16.6 Compliance  With  Laws  and  Regulations.  Notwithstanding  anything  in  the  Plan  to  the  contrary,  the  Committee,  in  its  sole  discretion,  may
bifurcate  the  Plan  so  as  to  restrict,  limit  or  condition  the  use  of  any  provision  of  the  Plan  to  Participants  who  are  officers  or  directors  subject  to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other Participants. With respect to officers and
directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, transactions under the Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Additionally, in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be construed as an “incentive stock option” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision.

Additionally, notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, it is the Company’s intention that any and all Awards and compensation
payable  under the  Plan shall  satisfy  the  requirements  for  exemption  under  Section  409A and that  all terms  and provisions  shall  be interpreted  to
satisfy  such  requirements.  If  the  Committee  determines  that  an  Award,  payment,  distribution,  deferral  election,  transaction  or  any  other  action  or
arrangement  contemplated  by  the  provisions  of  the  Plan  would,  if  undertaken,  cause  a  Participant  to  become  subject  to  Section  409A,  the
Committee, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right , but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or
modify the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan so that the Award qualifies for exemption from or compliance with Section 409A. Awards not
deferred  under  Section  6.3  and  not  otherwise  exempt  from  the  requirements  of  Section  409A  are  intended  to  qualify  for  the  short-term  deferral
exemption to Section 409A, and payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the Award became vested, but in no event shall
such payment be made later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the Award became vested unless otherwise permitted
under the exemption provisions of Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Award made under the Plan that is determined
to be “deferred compensation” (within the meaning of Section 409A), (a) references to Termination of Service will mean the Participant’s “separation
from service” (within the meaning of Section 409A) with the Company or any applicable Related Company, and (b) any payment to be made with
respect to such Award in connection with the Participant’s Termination of Service that would be subject to the limitations in Section 409A(a)(2)(b) of
the Code shall be delayed until six months after

11

the Participant’s separation from service (or earlier death) in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A.

16.7 Participants in Other Countries. The Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may be
necessary  or  desirable  to  comply  with  provisions  of  the  laws  of  other  countries  in  which  the  Company  or  any  Related  Company  may  operate  to
ensure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants employed in such countries, to comply with applicable foreign laws and to
meet the objectives of the Plan.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7.2 and 8.1, where applicable foreign law requires that compensatory stock right be priced based upon a
specific  price  averaging  method  and  period,  a  stock  right  granted  in  accordance  with  such  applicable  foreign  law  will  be  treated  as  meeting  the
requirements of Sections 7.2 or 8.1, provided that the averaging period does not exceed 30 days.

16.8 No Trust or Fund. The Plan is intended to constitute an “unfunded” plan. Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregate
any monies or other property, or shares of Common Stock, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferred
amounts  payable  to  any  Participant,  and  no  Participant  shall  have  any  rights  that  are  greater  than  those  of  a  general  unsecured  creditor  of  the
Company.

16.9 Successors All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether
the  existence  of  such  successor  is  the  result  of  a  direct  or  indirect  purchase,  merger,  consolidation,  or  otherwise,  of  all  or  substantially  all  the
business and/or assets of the Company.

16.10 Severability.  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any
person, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed
amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the Committee’s determination, materially
altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan
and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.

16.11 Choice of Law. The Plan, all Awards granted thereunder and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto, to the extent not
otherwise  governed  by the laws of the  United  States,  shall be governed  by and construed  in accordance  with the laws of the State  of  Delaware,
without reference to the principles of conflict of laws thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided in an applicable Award agreement.

This amendment and restatement of the Plan shall be effective December 9, 2021.
