FIRST QUARTER 2023 SEGMENT COMMENTARY:

Adjusted operational sales* reflected below excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and
translational currency.

Consumer Health

Consumer Health worldwide adjusted operational sales increased 11.3%* largely driven by over-the-counter (OTC)

products.  Major contributors to growth in OTC were TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesics, upper respiratory products,

IMODIUM  in  digestive  health  products  and  international  smoking  cessation  products.    Additional  contributors  to

growth were NEUTROGENA and AVEENO in Skin Health/Beauty products and JOHNSON’s in Baby Care products.

Pharmaceutical

Pharmaceutical worldwide adjusted operational sales grew 7.2%*, driven by DARZALEX (daratumumab), a biologic

for the treatment of multiple myeloma, STELARA (ustekinumab), a biologic for the treatment of a number of immune-

mediated  inflammatory diseases, ERLEADA  (apalutamide), a  next-generation  androgen  receptor inhibitor for  the

treatment  of  patients  with  prostate  cancer,  CARVYKTI  (ciltacabtagene  autoleucel),  a  BCMA-directed  CAR-T

immunotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple  myeloma,  and  XARELTO

(rivaroxaban), a direct oral anticoagulant.  Also contributing to growth were sales of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine

(Ad26.COV2.S) for the prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus.  This growth was partially offset by declines in sales of

REMICADE (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases,

IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), an oral, once daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, a type

of  blood  or  lymph  node  cancer,  and  ZYTIGA  (abiraterone  acetate),  an  oral,  once  daily  medication  for  use  in

combination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

MedTech

MedTech  worldwide  adjusted  operational  sales  grew  6.4%*,  driven  primarily  by  electrophysiology  products  in

Interventional  Solutions,  contact  lenses  in  Vision,  wound  closure  products  in  General  Surgery,  and  knees  in

Orthopaedics.    MedTech  worldwide  operational  sales  grew  11.0%*,  with  the  acquisition  of  Abiomed  contributing

4.6%.

FULL-YEAR 2023 GUIDANCE:

Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the company

is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses,

acquisition-related expenses and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort.  These

items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in

accordance with GAAP.

earnings”,  “adjusted  diluted  earnings  per  share”  and  “adjusted  operational  diluted  earnings  per  share”  excluding

after-tax intangible amortization expense and special items, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be

considered replacements for, and should be read together with, the most comparable GAAP financial measures.

Except  for  guidance  measures,  reconciliations  of  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  to  the  most  directly

comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the accompanying financial schedules of the earnings release

and the Investors section of the company's website at quarterly results.

NOTE TO INVESTORS CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act

of 1995 regarding, among other things: future operating and financial performance, product development, market

position and business strategy, and the anticipated separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business.  The

reader  is  cautioned  not  to  rely  on  these  forward-looking  statements.    These  statements  are  based  on  current

expectations  of  future  events.    If  underlying  assumptions  prove  inaccurate  or  known  or  unknown  risks  or

uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of Johnson &

Johnson.  Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rate and currency

exchange rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by

competitors; challenges inherent in new product research and development, including uncertainty of clinical success

and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success for new and existing products; challenges to

patents; the impact of patent expirations; the ability of the company to successfully execute strategic plans, including

restructuring  plans;  the  impact  of  business  combinations  and  divestitures;  manufacturing  difficulties  or  delays,

internally or within the supply chain; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory

action; significant adverse litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; changes to

applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws and global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost

containment;  changes  in  behavior  and  spending  patterns  of  purchasers  of  health  care  products  and  services;

financial instability of international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; increased scrutiny of the health

care industry by government agencies; the Company’s ability to satisfy the necessary conditions to consummate the

separation  of  the  Company’s  Consumer  Health  business  on  a  timely  basis  or  at  all;  the  Company’s  ability  to

successfully  separate  the  Company’s  Consumer  Health  business  and  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the

separation; and the New Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company.

A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s

Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  January  1,  2023,  including  in  the  sections  captioned

“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and in Johnson & Johnson’s

subsequent  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q  and  other  filings  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.

Copies of these filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.jnj.com or on request from Johnson & Johnson.

Any forward-looking statement made in this release speaks only as of the date of this release. Johnson & Johnson

does  not  undertake  to  update  any  forward-looking  statement  as  a  result  of  new  information  or  future  events  or

developments.

Notes:
COVID-19 Vaccine related costs include remaining commitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit costs
and required clinical trial expenses, associated with the Company's completion of its COVID-19 vaccine contractual commitments.

In the first quarter of 2023, the company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment within the
Pharmaceutical segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of
certain programs including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, HIV and hepatitis.  The
restructuring expenses of $130 million in the quarter include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset
impairments.

European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company’s previously registered
products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of
currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the
adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations.  The Company has
excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss
used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.
