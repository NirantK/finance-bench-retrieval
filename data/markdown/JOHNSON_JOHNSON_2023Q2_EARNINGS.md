SECOND QUARTER 2023 SEGMENT COMMENTARY:

Adjusted operational sales* reflected below excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and
translational currency.

Pharmaceutical

Pharmaceutical  worldwide  adjusted  operational  sales  grew  3.9%*.  Excluding  the  COVID-19  Vaccine,  adjusted

operational sales grew 6.2%*. Growth was driven by DARZALEX (daratumumab), ERLEADA (apalutamide), and

CARVYKTI  (ciltacabtagene  autoleucel)  in  Oncology,  STELARA  (ustekinumab)  and  TREMFYA  (guselkumab)  in

Immunology,  UPTRAVI  (selexipag)  and  OPSUMIT  (macitentan)  in  Pulmonary  Hypertension,  and  SPRAVATO

(esketamine)  in  Neuroscience.  Growth  was  partially  offset  by  ZYTIGA  (abiraterone  acetate)  and  IMBRUVICA

(ibrutinib) in Oncology, COVID-19 Vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S) in Infectious Diseases, and REMICADE (infliximab) in

Immunology.

MedTech

MedTech  worldwide  adjusted  operational  sales  grew  9.9%*,  driven  primarily  by  electrophysiology  products  in

Interventional  Solutions,  trauma  in  Orthopaedics,  wound  closure  products  in  General  Surgery,  biosurgery  in

Advanced  Surgery,  and  contact  lenses  in  Vision.  MedTech  worldwide  operational  sales  grew  14.7%*,  with  the

acquisition of Abiomed contributing 4.8%.

Consumer Health

Consumer Health worldwide adjusted operational sales increased 7.7%* largely driven by over-the-counter (OTC)

products.  Major contributors to growth in OTC were TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesics, upper respiratory products,

international  smoking  cessation  products,  and  IMODIUM  in  digestive  health  products.  Additional  contributors  to

growth  were  NEUTROGENA  in  Skin  Health/Beauty  products  and  Women’s  Health  products  outside  the  United

States.

FULL-YEAR 2023 GUIDANCE:

Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the company

is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses,

acquisition-related expenses and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort.  These

items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in

accordance with GAAP.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES:

*  “Operational  sales  growth”  excluding  the  impact  of  translational  currency,  “adjusted  operational  sales  growth”

excluding  the  net  impact  of  acquisitions  and  divestitures  and  translational  currency,  as  well  as  “adjusted  net

earnings”,  “adjusted  diluted  earnings  per  share”  and  “adjusted  operational diluted  earnings  per  share”  excluding

after-tax intangible amortization expense and special items, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be

considered replacements for, and should be read together with, the most comparable GAAP financial measures.

Except  for  guidance  measures,  reconciliations  of  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  to  the  most  directly

comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the accompanying financial schedules of the earnings release

and the Investors section of the company's website at quarterly results.

Copies of the financial schedules accompanying this earnings release are available on the company’s website at

earnings,  reconciliations  of  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  and  sales  of  key  products/franchises.  Additional

information on Johnson & Johnson, including adjusted income before tax by segment, a pharmaceutical pipeline of

selected compounds in late stage development and a copy of today’s earnings call presentation can also be found

NOTE TO INVESTORS CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act

of 1995 regarding, among other things: future operating and financial performance, product development, market

position and business strategy, and the anticipated separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business.  The

reader  is  cautioned  not  to  rely  on  these  forward-looking  statements.    These  statements  are  based  on  current

expectations  of  future  events.    If  underlying  assumptions  prove  inaccurate  or  known  or  unknown  risks  or

uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of Johnson &

Johnson.  Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rate and currency

exchange rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by

competitors; challenges inherent in new product research and development, including uncertainty of clinical success

and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success for new and existing products; challenges to

patents; the impact of patent expirations; the ability of the company to successfully execute strategic plans, including

restructuring  plans;  the  impact  of  business  combinations  and  divestitures;  manufacturing  difficulties  or  delays,

internally or within the supply chain; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory

action; significant adverse litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; changes to

applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws and global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost

containment;  changes  in  behavior  and  spending  patterns  of  purchasers  of  health  care  products  and  services;

financial instability of international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; increased scrutiny of the health

care industry by government agencies; the Company’s ability to satisfy the necessary conditions to consummate the

separation  of  the  Company’s  Consumer  Health  business  on  a  timely  basis  or  at  all;  the  Company’s  ability  to

successfully  separate  the  Company’s  Consumer  Health  business  and  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the

separation; and the New Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company.

A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s

Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  January  1,  2023,  including  in  the  sections  captioned

“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and in Johnson & Johnson’s

subsequent  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q  and  other  filings  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.

Copies of these filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.jnj.com or on request from Johnson & Johnson.

Any forward-looking statement made in this release speaks only as of the date of this release. Johnson & Johnson

does  not  undertake  to  update  any  forward-looking  statement  as  a  result  of  new  information  or  future  events  or

developments.

Notes:
COVID-19 Vaccine related costs include remaining commitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit costs and required clinical trial expenses,
associated with the Company's completion of its COVID-19 vaccine contractual commitments.

In the first and second quarter of 2023, the company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment within the Pharmaceutical segment to focus
on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are
primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development.  The
restructuring expenses of $145 million in the quarter ($275 million Q2 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.

European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company’s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the
existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning
in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has
excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and
assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.

The tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted
earnings.
