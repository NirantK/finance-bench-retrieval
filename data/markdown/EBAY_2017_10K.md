ITEM 1: BUSINESS

Overview

eBay  Inc.  was  formed  as  a  sole  proprietorship  in  September  1995  and  was  incorporated  in  California  in  May  1996.  In  April  1998,  we
reincorporated in Delaware, and in September 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices are
located at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7400. Unless otherwise expressly stated or
the  context  otherwise  requires,  when  we  refer  to  “we,”  “our,”  “us”  or  “eBay”  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  mean  the  current  Delaware
corporation  (eBay  Inc.)  and  its  California  predecessor,  as  well  as  all  of  its  consolidated  subsidiaries.  When  we  refer  to  “eBay  Inc.”  we  mean  our
Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms.

eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, we connect millions
of  buyers  and  sellers  around  the  world.  The  technologies  and  services  that  power  our  platforms  are  designed  to  enable  sellers  worldwide  to
organize and offer their inventory for sale, and buyers to find and purchase it, virtually anytime and anywhere. Our Marketplace platforms include our
online marketplace  located at www.ebay.com,  its localized counterparts  and the eBay mobile apps. We believe that these are among the world’s
largest  and most  vibrant  marketplaces  for  discovering  great  value  and unique  selection.  Our  StubHub  platforms  include  our online ticket  platform
located  at  www.stubhub.com,  its  localized  counterparts  and  the  StubHub  mobile  apps.  These  platforms  connect  fans  with  their  favorite  sporting
events, shows and artists and enable them to buy and sell millions of tickets whenever and wherever they want. Our Classifieds platforms include a
collection  of  brands  such  as mobile.de,  Kijiji,  Gumtree,  Marktplaats,  eBay  Kleinanzeigen  and others.  Offering  online classifieds  around  the  world,
these platforms help people find whatever they are looking for in their local communities.

Our  platforms  are  accessible  through  a  traditional  online  experience  (e.g.,  desktop  and  laptop  computers),  from  mobile  devices  (e.g.,
smartphones and tablets) and via our application programming interfaces or APIs (platform access for third party software developers). Our multi-
screen approach offers downloadable, easy-to-use applications for iOS and Android mobile devices that allow access to ebay.com and some of our
other websites and vertical shopping experiences. In addition, our platform is increasingly based on open source technologies that provide industry-
standard ways for software developers and merchants to access our APIs, to develop software and solutions for commerce.

Our Strategy

Delivering the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform

Our strategy is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform for our buyers and sellers. We focus on

connecting buyers and sellers through simplified experiences to make it easier for users to list, find and buy items.

On our Marketplace  platform,  our strategy  is to  drive  the best  choice by attracting  and retaining  sellers  and brands  that bring differentiated
inventory to eBay and provide our consumers with great selection and value. This includes new, everyday items as well as rare and unique goods,
with  a  majority  of  items  available  with  free  shipping  and  delivery  in  three  business  days  or  less.  To  help  deliver  the  most  relevance,  we  are
innovating new shopping experiences tailored to each user’s interests, passions and shopping history. Leveraging the foundation of structured data -
our  initiative  to  better  understand,  organize  and  leverage  inventory  on  eBay  -  we  are  delivering  more  personalized,  discovery-based  user
experiences and making it easier for customers to find inventory both on and off eBay. We focus on offering the most powerful selling platform for
our business and consumer sellers by continuing to expand adoption of our Seller Hub product, while adding new capabilities to enable sellers to
build their businesses and drive profitable sales on eBay.

The eBay brand is one of our most important strategic assets.  In 2017, we activated a new, global brand platform – Fill Your Cart With Color
– intended to facilitate increased consideration of eBay to drive more traffic and new buyers to our platforms.  As part of this effort, we rolled out
local  campaigns  in North  America,  Europe and  Australia  using  multiple  channels,  including  television,  digital  and social.   This  is  the  first  time  the
company has adopted a truly global brand approach, and we view this as a long-term initiative that will require on-going investment as the brand
evolves.

As  one  of  the  world’s  largest  ticket  marketplaces,  StubHub  connects  people  through  inspiring  live  experiences.  Event-goers  can  find  more
than  10  million  live  sports,  music,  theater  and  other  events  in  more  than  40  countries  on  our  StubHub  platforms,  and  can  browse,  buy  and  sell
anytime, anywhere through desktop and mobile devices. We continue to extend StubHub’s reach by focusing on supply expansion, which includes
increasing consumer selling on our site, and broadening StubHub’s international footprint to provide consumers a global major events catalog.

A  world  leader  in  online  classifieds,  eBay  Classifieds  is  designed  to  help  people  list  their  products  and  services,  generally  for  free,  find
whatever they are looking for in their local communities and trade at a local level. eBay Classifieds Group’s brands offer both horizontal and vertical
experiences, such as motors, real estate and jobs. We offer a personalized classifieds experience and focus on expanding our value proposition by
leveraging data and analytics to improve customer relevance and growing the classifieds opportunity on mobile.

Business model and pricing

On  our  eBay  and  StubHub  platforms,  our  business  model  and  pricing  are  designed  so  that  our  business  is  successful  primarily  when  our
sellers are successful. We make money primarily through fees collected on successfully closed sales. On our Classifieds platform, we monetize our
business primarily through advertising.

The size and scale of our platforms are designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage our economies of scale and capital investment,

for example in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisition and customer service.

Our offerings for buyers and sellers

We provide a number of features for our buyers and sellers that are designed to build trust, make users more comfortable buying and selling

on our platforms and reward our top sellers for their loyalty.

For our buyers, we believe that eBay sellers offer some of the best value and deals available for a number of consumer products. This year
we introduced Price Match Guarantee, which allows buyers to feel comfortable knowing that they are getting the best price on the more than 80,000
items where we match the prices of our competitors in key regions worldwide. We also unveiled eBay Authenticate, in which sellers can have their
luxury items, such as high-end handbags, authenticated by eBay, enabling customers to shop for exclusive goods with confidence. Additionally, the
majority of our transactions in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany continue to include free shipping.

5

eBay  Money  Back  Guarantee  covers  most  items  purchased  on  the  eBay  platform  in  a  number  of  countries,  including  the  U.S.,  the  U.K.,
Germany and Australia, through a qualifying payment method and protects most buyers with respect to items that are not received or are received
but not as described in the listing. Some purchases, including some vehicles, are not covered. eBay Money Back Guarantee provides coverage for
the purchase price of the item, plus original shipping costs, for a limited period of time from the date of delivery and includes a streamlined interface
to help buyers and sellers navigate the process.

For our sellers,  eBay’s Top Rated Seller program  rewards  qualifying sellers with fee discounts and improved search standing for qualifying
listings if they are able to maintain excellent customer service ratings and meet specified criteria for shipping and returns. We believe that sellers
who fulfill these standards help promote our goal of maintaining an online marketplace that is safe and hassle-free.

We also help our sellers gain added visibility and velocity for their inventory. This year, we began to scale the eBay Promoted Listings product,
which  is  designed  to  enable  sellers  to  increase  the  visibility  of  item  listings  on  eBay  to  have  a  better  chance  of  selling.  We  also  removed  some
competing third-party product listing ads on the eBay platform in select locations.

eBay regularly evaluates pricing relative to alternatives in the market in order to remain competitive. In 2017, we implemented a number of
changes to our policies and pricing in an effort to better incent sellers to deliver better buyer experiences. At the same time, we continued to invest
in more tools and new programs to help grow the overall seller ecosystem.

We offer choice to buyers and sellers across a number of dimensions.

For sellers, this includes:
•

Sellers can choose to list their products and services through fixed price listings or an auction-style format on our platforms. The fixed
price format on eBay allows buyers and sellers to close transactions at a pre-determined price set by the seller. Sellers also are able to
signal that they would be willing to close the transaction  at a lower price through the Best Offer  feature.  Additionally, our auction-style
format allows a seller to select a minimum price for opening bids.
Sellers can list items that are new, refurbished and used, and common and rare on our Marketplace platforms.
Sellers can use Promoted Listings to improve the visibility of their item listings so that items have a better chance of standing out and
selling faster.
Sellers can list luxury items, such as high-end handbags, through eBay Authenticate, giving buyers greater confidence in the luxury item
they are purchasing.

For buyers, this includes:
•

Buyers can search for and purchase items that are new, refurbished and used, and common and rare on our Marketplace platforms, in
categories such a Parts and Accessories, Fashion and Electronics.
Buyers can filter searches for items by one-, two- and three-day delivery through eBay Guaranteed Delivery.
Buyers can have greater confidence in purchasing high-end handbags through eBay Authenticate.
Buyers  also  can  have  items  shipped  to  them  through  multiple  shipping  options  offered  by  sellers.  For  certain  items  purchased  from
certain retailers, buyers can pick up items they purchased online or through mobile devices in one of the retailer’s physical stores (which
we refer to as in-store pickup).

Our Impact and Responsibility

For  more  than  two  decades,  we  have  worked  to  create  a  marketplace  that  is  inclusive  and  fair,  fosters  global  trade  and  empowers  small
business  entrepreneurship.  By  connecting  buyers  and  sellers  online,  wherever  they  are  in  the  world,  we  aim  to  enable  everyone  to  find  their
personal version of perfect—and in the process, participate in the global economy and enrich their lives and livelihoods. Through eBay for Charity,
we also enable our community to give to the causes they care about. We strive to operate in the most environmentally and socially sustainable way,
creating a safe, trusted, diverse environment in which our employees, buyers, sellers, suppliers and partners can thrive.

Financial Information

We measure our footprint in our addressable market according to Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”). GMV consists of the total value of all
successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms during the applicable period, regardless of whether the
buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction.

At the end of 2017, our Marketplace and StubHub platforms had more than 170 million active buyers and over one billion live listings globally.
The term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyers who successfully closed a transaction on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms within
the previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one account.

We  generate  revenue  primarily  from  the  transactions  we  successfully  enable  and  through  marketing  services,  including  classifieds  and
advertising. The majority of our revenue comes from a take rate on the GMV of transactions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. We
define  “take  rate”  as  net  transaction  revenues  divided  by  GMV.  In  2017  ,  we  generated  $88  billion  in  GMV,  of  which  approximately  59%  was
generated outside the U.S.

For  additional  financial  information  as  well  as  the  geographic  areas  where  we  conduct  business,  please  see  “Note  6  -  Segments”  to  the
consolidated financial statements included in this report. Additionally, please see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Our
international  operations are subject to increased risks,  which could harm our business,”  which describes risks associated with eBay Inc.’s  foreign
operations.

Notable Business Transactions in 2017

We  regularly  review  and  manage  our  investments  to  ensure  that  they  support  eBay’s  strategic  direction  and  complement  our  disciplined
approach to value creation, profitability and capital allocation.  During the third quarter of 2017, we made a $500 million cash investment in and sold
our eBay India business to Flipkart. eBay and Flipkart also entered into an exclusive agreement in which they will jointly pursue cross-border trade
opportunities to make eBay’s global inventory accessible to more India consumers, while eBay’s millions of active buyers globally will have access to
Indian inventory provided by Flipkart.

Competition

We encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can find, buy, sell and pay for similar items through a
variety of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export
companies,  auctioneers,  catalog  and  mail-order  companies,  classifieds,  directories,  search  engines,  commerce  participants  (consumer-to-
consumer,  business-to-consumer and  business-to-business), shopping channels and  networks.  As  our  product offerings  continue to  broaden into
new  categories  of  items  and  new  commerce  formats,  we  expect  to  face  additional  competition  from  other  online,  mobile  and  offline  channels  for
those new offerings. We compete on the basis of price, product selection and services.

For more information  regarding these risks, see the information  in “Item  1A: Risk Factors”  under the captions “Substantial and increasingly
intense  competition  worldwide  in  ecommerce  may  harm  our  business”  and  “We  are  subject  to  regulatory  activity  and  antitrust  litigation  under
competition laws.”

To compete effectively, we will need to continue to expend significant resources in technology and marketing. These efforts require substantial
expenditures,  which  could  reduce  our  margins  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  position,  operating  results  and  cash
flows  and  reduce  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  and  outstanding  debt  securities.  Despite  our  efforts  to  preserve  and  expand  the  size,
diversity  and  transaction  activity  of  our  buyers  and  sellers  and  to  enhance  the  user  experience,  we  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  manage  our
operating expenses, to increase or maintain our revenue or to avoid a decline in our consolidated net income or a net loss.

Government Regulation

Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerce
industry in many countries where we operate. For more information regarding these risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the
caption “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight.”

7

Seasonality

We expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in

“Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Seasonality.”

Technology

eBay Inc.’s platforms utilize a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others.
We have developed intuitive user interfaces, buyer and seller tools and transaction processing, database and network applications that help enable
our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large
amounts  of  data,  eases  the  deployment  and  operation  of  large-scale  global  products  and  services  and  automates  much  of  the  administration  of
large-scale clusters of computers. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of
outages or catastrophic occurrences. We strive to continually improve our technology to enhance the buyer and seller experience and to increase
efficiency,  scalability  and  security.  Additionally,  we  recently  embarked  on  a  multi-year  evolution  of  our  shopping  platform  that  aims  to  deliver
relevant,  persistent  and  personalized  experiences  for  consumers.  For  information  regarding  technology-related  risks,  see  the  information  in  “Item
1A:  Risk  Factors”  under  the  caption  “Systems  failures  or  cyberattacks  and  resulting  interruptions  in  the  availability  of  or  degradation  in  the
performance of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business.”

Intellectual Property

We  regard  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  including  our  trademarks  (particularly  those  covering  the  eBay  name),  patents,
copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying
on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual
restrictions  to protect  our proprietary  rights in products  and services.  We routinely enter into confidentiality  and invention assignment  agreements
with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure of
our proprietary information.

We  pursue  the  registration  of  our  domain  names,  trademarks  and  service  marks  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally.  Additionally,  we  have  filed
U.S.  and  international  patent  applications  covering  certain  aspects  of  our  proprietary  technology.  Effective  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  domain
name, trade dress and trade secret protection is typically expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property
rights  and  other  proprietary  rights  in  an  increasing  number  of  jurisdictions,  a  process  that  is  expensive  and  time  consuming  and  may  not  be
successful.

We have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place
an active program  to continue to secure trademarks  and domain names that correspond  to our brands in markets  of interest.  If we are unable to
register or protect our trademarks or domain names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain names
are  not  registered  or  protected.  We  have  licensed  in  the  past,  and  expect  to  license  in  the  future,  certain  of  our  proprietary  rights,  such  as
trademarks or copyrighted material, to others.

From time to time, third parties have claimed - and others will likely claim in the future - that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.
We are typically involved in a number of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and in “Item
1A:  Risk  Factors”  under  the  captions  “We  are  subject  to  patent  litigation,”  “The  listing  or  sale  by  our  users  of  items  that  allegedly  infringe  the
intellectual property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeit items, may harm our business,” and “We may be unable to adequately
protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.”

Employees

As of December 31, 2017 , we employed approximately 14,100 people globally. Approximately 7,300 of our employees were located in the

U.S.

Item 1A: RISK FACTORS

You should carefully review the following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as
well  as  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  and  the  other  information  appearing  in  this  report,  for  important  information
regarding risks that affect us.

Risk Factors That May Affect our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Our operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition,

results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock and debt securities.

Our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a
result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source
of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating
results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. We do not have backlog, and substantially
all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues,
it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in
our  consolidated  financial  statements  may  be  significantly  different  from  historical  or  projected  rates.  Our  operating  results  in  one  or  more  future
quarters  may  fall  below  the  expectations  of  securities  analysts  and  investors.  The  trading  price  of  our  common  stock  and  debt  securities  could
decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described in this paragraph.

Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business.

The businesses and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of online
and offline companies providing goods and services to consumers and merchants. The Internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolving
and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods and services. We compete in two-sided markets, and must attract both buyers
and sellers to use our platforms. Consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through us have more and more alternatives, and merchants
have more channels to reach consumers. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Online and offline businesses increasingly are competing
with  each  other  and  our  competitors  include  a  number  of  online  and  offline  retailers  with  significant  resources,  large  user  communities  and  well-
established  brands.  Moreover,  the  barriers  to  entry  into  these  channels  can  be  low,  and  businesses  easily  can  launch  online  sites  or  mobile
platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful ecommerce
companies. As we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions or
acquisitions  that  may  be  controversial  with  and  lead  to  dissatisfaction  among  sellers,  which  could  reduce  activity  on  our  platform  and  harm  our
profitability.

We  face  increased  competitive  pressure  online  and  offline.  In  particular,  the  competitive  norm  for,  and  the  expected  level  of  service  from,
ecommerce  and  mobile  commerce  has  significantly  increased,  due  to,  among  other  factors,  improved  user  experience,  greater  ease  of  buying
goods, lower (or no) shipping costs, faster  shipping times  and more favorable  return policies. Also, certain platform  businesses, such as Alibaba,
Amazon,  Apple,  Facebook  and Google,  many  of  whom  are  larger  than  us  or have  greater  capitalization,  have a dominant  and secure  position  in
other industries or certain significant markets, and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. If we are unable
to  change  our  products,  offerings  and  services  in  ways  that  reflect  the  changing  demands  of  ecommerce  and  mobile  commerce  marketplaces,
particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed-price items and higher expected service levels (some of which depend on services provided by sellers
on our platforms), or compete effectively with and adapt to changes in larger platform businesses, our business will suffer.

Competitors  with  other  revenue  sources  may  also  be  able  to  devote  more  resources  to  marketing  and  promotional  campaigns,  adopt  more
aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to website, mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can. Other
competitors  may  offer  or  continue  to  offer  faster  and/or  free  shipping,  delivery  on  Sunday,  same-day  delivery,  favorable  return  policies  or  other
transaction-related services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match.
Competitors  may  be  able  to  innovate  faster  and  more  efficiently,  and  new  technologies  may  increase  the  competitive  pressures  by  enabling
competitors to offer more efficient or lower-cost services.

10

Some  of  our  competitors  control  other  products  and  services  that  are  important  to  our  success,  including  credit  card  interchange,  Internet
search, and mobile operating systems. Such competitors could manipulate pricing, availability, terms or operation of service related to their products
and services in a manner that impacts our competitive offerings. For example, Google, which operates a shopping platform service, has from time to
time made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to us from searches on Google. If we are unable to
use or adapt to operational changes in such services, we may face higher costs for such services, face integration or technological barriers or lose
customers, which could cause our business to suffer.

Consumers who might use our sites to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives, including traditional department, warehouse, boutique,
discount and general merchandise stores (as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), online retailers and their related
mobile  offerings,  online  and  offline  classified  services  and  other  shopping  channels,  such  as  offline  and  online  home  shopping  networks.  In  the
United  States,  these  include  Amazon.com,  Facebook,  Google,  Wal-Mart,  Target,  Macy’s,  JC  Penney,  Costco,  Office  Depot,  Staples,  OfficeMax,
Sam’s Club, Rakuten, MSN, QVC and Home Shopping Network, among others. In addition, consumers have a large number of online and offline
channels focused on one or more of the categories of products offered on our site.

Consumers also can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items from
sellers of all sizes, including social media, online aggregation and classifieds platforms, such as craigslist, Oodle.com and a number of international
websites  operated  by  Schibsted  ASA  or  Naspers  Limited.  Consumers  also  can  turn  to  shopping-comparison  sites,  such  as  Google  Shopping.  In
certain  markets,  our  fixed-price  listing  and  traditional  auction-style  listing  formats  increasingly  are  being  challenged  by  other  formats,  such  as
classifieds.

Our Classifieds platforms  offer classifieds listings in the United States and a variety of international markets.  In many markets  in which they
operate,  our  Classifieds  platforms  compete  for  customers  and  for  advertisers  against  more  established  online  and  offline  classifieds  platforms  or
other competing websites.

We use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites, but these services also have the potential to divert
users  to  other  online  shopping  destinations.  Consumers  may  choose  to  search  for  products  and  services  with  a  horizontal  search  engine  or
shopping  comparison  website,  and  such  sites  may  also  send  users  to  other  shopping  destinations.  In  addition,  sellers  are  increasingly  utilizing
multiple sales channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search-related advertisements on horizontal search engine sites,
such as Google, Naver and Baidu.

Consumers  and merchants  who might  use  our  sites  to  sell  goods  also  have  many  alternatives,  including  general  ecommerce  sites,  such  as
Amazon,  Alibaba  and  11Street,  and  more  specialized  sites,  such  as  Etsy.  Our  international  sites  also  compete  for  sellers  with  general  and
specialized  ecommerce  sites.  Sellers  may  also  choose  to  sell  their  goods  through  other  channels,  such  as  classifieds  platforms.  Consumers  and
merchants also can create and sell through their own sites, and may choose to purchase online advertising instead of using our services. In some
countries,  there  are  online  sites  that  have  larger  customer  bases  and  greater  brand  recognition,  as  well  as  competitors  that  may  have  a  better
understanding  of  local  culture  and  commerce.  We  increasingly  may  compete  with  local  competitors  in  developing  countries  that  have  unique
advantages, such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authorities.

In addition, certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels, such as our sites. Manufacturers
may attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goods
or services. Manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to prevent
distributors from selling on our platforms or on the Internet generally, or at prices that would make us less attractive relative to other alternatives.
The adoption by manufacturers of policies, or their use of laws or regulations, in each case discouraging or restricting the sales of goods or services
over the Internet, could force our users to stop selling certain products on our platforms, which could result in reduced operating margins, loss of
market share and diminished value of our brands.

11

The principal competitive factors for us include the following:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

ability to attract, retain and engage buyers and sellers;
volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;
trust in the seller and the transaction;
customer service;
brand recognition;
community cohesion, interaction and size;
website, mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;
system reliability and security;
reliability of delivery and payment, including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returns;
level of service fees; and
quality of search tools.

We  may  be  unable  to  compete  successfully  against  current  and  future  competitors.  Some  current  and  potential  competitors  have  longer

operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and Internet sectors than we do.

Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.

Our  operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on  global  and  regional  economic  conditions.  Adverse  economic  conditions  and  events
(including volatility or distress in the equity and/or debt or credit markets) have in the past negatively impacted regional and global financial markets
and will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future. These events and conditions, including uncertainties and instability in economic and
market conditions caused by the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union, could have a negative and adverse impact on companies and
customers with which we do business or cause us to write down our assets or investments. In addition, financial turmoil affecting the banking system
or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, new or
incremental  tightening  in  the  credit  markets,  low  liquidity,  and  extreme  volatility  in  fixed  income,  credit,  currency,  and  equity  markets.  Adverse
impacts to the companies and customers with which we do business, the banking system, or financial markets could have a material adverse effect
on our business, including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our commerce platforms.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Because we generate the majority of our revenues outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial results
are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or foreign exchange rates. The results of operations of many of our internationally
focused  platforms  are exposed to foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  as the  financial  results  of the applicable subsidiaries  are translated  from  the
local currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign
currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. Similarly, if the U.S. dollar
strengthens  against  foreign  currencies,  particularly  the  euro,  British  pound,  Korean  won  or  Australian  dollar,  our  translation  of  foreign  currency
denominated revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated net revenues and expenses. In addition to this translation effect, a
strengthening U.S. dollar will typically adversely affect the volume of goods being sold by U.S. sellers to Europe and Australia more than it positively
affects  the  volume  of  goods  being  sold  by  sellers  in  those  geographies  to  buyers  in  the  United  States,  thereby  further  negatively  impacting  our
financial results.

While from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or
eliminate  the  effects  of  this  exposure.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  could  significantly  impact  our  financial  results,  which  may  have  a
significant impact on the trading price of our common stock and debt securities.

12

Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.

Our international businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Korea, and cross-border business from greater China,
have  generated  a  majority  of  our  net  revenues  in  recent  years.  In  addition  to  uncertainty  about  our  ability  to  generate  revenues  from  our  foreign
operations and expand into international markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:

•
•

•

•
•

•
•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union;
uncertainty regarding how the United Kingdom’s access to the European Union Single Market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory and
labor  environments,  especially  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  European  Union,  will  be  impacted  by  the  United  Kingdom’s  vote  to  exit  the
European Union, including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients;
expenses  associated  with  localizing  our  products  and  services  and  customer  data,  including  offering  customers  the  ability  to  transact
business  in  the  local  currency  and  adapting  our  products  and  services  to  local  preferences  (e.g.,  payment  methods)  with  which  we  may
have limited or no experience;
trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;
difficulties  in  developing,  staffing,  and  simultaneously  managing  a  large  number  of  varying  foreign  operations  as  a  result  of  distance,
language, and cultural differences;
stringent local labor laws and regulations;
credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
profit  repatriation  restrictions,  foreign  currency  exchange  restrictions  or  extreme  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  for  a
particular currency;
political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;
geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;
import or export regulations;
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials,
as well as U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;
antitrust and competition regulations;
potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;
economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;
different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;
risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;
national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;
local licensing and reporting obligations; and
increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.

Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions,
or  sanctions  against  us,  our  officers,  or  our  employees;  prohibitions  on  the  conduct  of  our  business;  and  damage  to  our  reputation.  Although  we
have  implemented  policies  and  procedures  designed  to  promote  compliance  with  these  laws,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  employees,
contractors,  or  agents  will  not  violate  our  policies.  These  risks  inherent  in  our  international  operations  and expansion  increase  our  costs  of  doing
business internationally and could harm our business.

Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.

Cross-border  trade  is  an  important  source  of  both  revenue  and  profits  for  us.  Cross-border  trade  also  represents  our  primary  (or  in  some
cases, only) presence in certain important markets, such as Brazil/Latin America, China, and various other countries. In addition, our cross-border
trade is also subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

The interpretation and application of specific national or regional laws, such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products,
selective distribution networks, and sellers in other countries listing items on the Internet, and the potential interpretation and application of laws of
multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the buyer, the seller, and/or the location of the item being sold) are often extremely complicated in the
context of cross-border trade. The interpretation and/or application of such laws could impose restrictions on, or increase the costs of, purchasing,
selling, shipping, or returning goods across national borders.

13

The shipping of goods across national borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping. Customs and duty procedures
and  reviews,  including  duty-free  thresholds  in  various  key  markets,  the  interaction  of  national  postal  systems,  and  security  related  governmental
processes  at  international  borders,  may  increase  costs,  discourage  cross-border  purchases,  delay  transit  and  create  shipping  uncertainties.  Any
factors  that  increase  the  costs  of  cross-border  trade  or  restrict,  delay,  or  make  cross-border  trade  more  difficult  or  impractical  would  lower  our
revenues and profits and could harm our business.

Our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical events, natural disasters, seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users to

spend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and applications, including increased usage of other websites.

Our  users  may  spend  less  time  on  our  websites  and  our  applications  for  mobile  devices  as  a  result  of  a  variety  of  diversions,  including:
geopolitical  events,  such  as  war,  the  threat  of  war,  or  terrorist  activity;  natural  disasters;  power  shortages  or  outages,  major  public  health  issues,
including pandemics; social networking or other entertainment websites or mobile applications; significant local, national or global events capturing
the attention of a large part of the population; and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors. If any of these, or any other factors, divert our
users from using of our websites or mobile applications, our business could be materially adversely affected.

Our success depends to a large degree on our ability to successfully address the rapidly evolving market for transactions on mobile devices.

Mobile devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions. A significant and growing portion of our users access our platforms through
mobile devices. We may lose users if we are not able to continue to meet our users’ mobile and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety of
technical  and  other  configurations  across  different  mobile  devices  and  platforms  increases  the  challenges  associated  with  this  environment.  In
addition,  a  number  of  other  companies  with  significant  resources  and  a  number  of  innovative  startups  have  introduced  products  and  services
focusing on mobile markets.

Our  ability  to  successfully  address  the  challenges  posed  by  the  rapidly  evolving  market  for  mobile  transactions  is  crucial  to  our  continued

success, and any failure to continuously increase the volume of mobile transactions effected through our platforms could harm our business.

If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative programs, products and services, the use of our

products and our revenues could decline.

Rapid, significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate. We cannot predict the effect of technological
changes on our business. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the
development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will
continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products
and services. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and
ultimately  may  not  be  successful.  In  addition,  our  ability  to  adopt  new  services  and  develop  new  technologies  may  be  inhibited  by  industry-wide
standards, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from clients or merchants, or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Our success will
depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight.

We  are  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  affecting  our  domestic  and  international  operations  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  consumer
protection, data privacy requirements, intellectual property ownership and infringement, prohibited items and stolen goods, resale of event tickets,
tax, anti-competition, export requirements, anti-corruption, labor, advertising, digital content, real estate, billing, ecommerce, promotions, quality of
services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, environmental, and health and safety regulations, as well as laws and regulations
intended to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.

14

Compliance  with  these  laws,  regulations,  and  similar  requirements  may  be  onerous  and  expensive,  and  variances  and  inconsistencies  from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of
changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive
to our customers, delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices.
We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance
that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.

Regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business.

We  are  subject  to  laws  relating  to  the  collection,  use,  retention,  security,  and  transfer  of  personally  identifiable  information  about  our  users
around  the  world.  Much  of  the  personal  information  that  we  collect,  especially  financial  information,  is  regulated  by  multiple  laws.  User  data
protection  laws  may  be  interpreted  and  applied  inconsistently  from  country  to  country.  In  many  cases,  these  laws  apply  not  only  to  third-party
transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial
relations. These laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and that may harm our business.

Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. We are subject to a number
of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over
time, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. Some of these laws impose requirements that are inconsistent with one
another, yet regulators may claim that both apply. Complying with these varying national requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or
require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a  manner  adverse  to  our  business  and  violations  of  privacy-related  laws  can  result  in  significant
penalties. In addition, compliance with these laws may restrict our ability to provide services to our customers that they may find to be valuable. A
determination  that  there  have  been  violations  of  laws  relating  to  our  practices  under  communications-based  laws  could  expose  us  to  significant
damage  awards,  fines  and  other  penalties  that  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  materially  harm  our  business.  In  particular,  because  of  the
enormous number of texts, emails and other communications we send to our users, communications laws that provide a specified monetary damage
award or fine for each violation (such as those described below) could result in particularly large awards or fines.

For example, the Federal Communications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or
TCPA,  in  2012  and  2013  in  a  manner  that  could  increase  our  exposure  to  liability  for  certain  types  of  telephonic  communication  with  customers,
including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500
per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We are regularly subject to class-action
lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that our businesses violated the TCPA. These lawsuits, and other private lawsuits not
currently alleged as class actions, seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the enormous
number  of  communications  we  send  to  our  users,  a  determination  that  there  have  been  violations  of  the  TCPA  or  other  communications-based
statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.

We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived
failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy
or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class
action privacy litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs
and adversely affect our business. Data collection, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If Internet and mobile
users  were  to  reduce  their  use  of  our  websites,  mobile  platforms,  products,  and  services  as  a  result  of  these  concerns,  our  business  could  be
harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.

15

Other laws and regulations could harm our business.

It  is  not  always  clear  how  laws  and  regulations  governing  matters  relevant  to  our  business,  such  as  property  ownership,  copyrights,
trademarks,  and other intellectual property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, and obscenity apply to
our  businesses.  Many  of  these  laws  were  adopted  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  Internet,  mobile,  and  related  technologies  and,  as  a  result,  do  not
contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Many of these laws, including some of those that do reference
the Internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws
and  regulations  increases  the  risk  that  we  will  be  subject  to  private  claims  and  governmental  actions  alleging  violations  of  those  laws  and
regulations.

As our activities, the products and services we offer, and our geographical scope continue to expand, regulatory agencies or courts may claim
or  hold  that  we  or  our  users  are  subject  to  additional  requirements  (including  licensure)  or  prohibited  from  conducting  our  business  in  their
jurisdiction, either generally or with respect to certain actions. Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on large
companies,  and  regulatory  agencies  may  view  matters  or  interpret  laws  and  regulations  differently  than  they  have  in  the  past  and  in  a  manner
adverse  to  our  businesses.  Our  success  and  increased  visibility  have  driven  some  existing  businesses  that  perceive  us  to  be  a  threat  to  their
businesses  to  raise  concerns  about  our  business  models  to  policymakers  and  regulators.  These  businesses  and  their  trade  association  groups
employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations. They may
employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and
the  ability  of  users  to  use  our  products  and  services.  These  established  businesses  have  raised  concerns  relating  to  pricing,  parallel  imports,
professional  seller  obligations,  selective  distribution  networks,  stolen  goods,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  other  intellectual  property  rights  and  the
liability  of  the  provider  of  an  Internet  marketplace  for  the  conduct  of  its  users  related  to  those  and  other  issues.  Any  changes  to  the  legal  or
regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for third-party listings could negatively impact our business.

Numerous  U.S.  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  the  State  of  California,  have  regulations  regarding  “auctions”  and  the  handling  of
property by “secondhand dealers” or “pawnbrokers.” Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations upon
us  or  our  users,  and  others  may  attempt  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Attempted  enforcement  of  these  laws  against  some  of  our  users  appears  to  be
increasing  and  we  could  be  required  to  change  the  way  we  or  our  users  do  business  in  ways  that  increase  costs  or  reduce  revenues,  such  as
forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties,
and any of these outcomes could harm our business.

A number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our platforms subject to unfavorable local laws. For example,
“trademark exhaustion” principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been
placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holder’s consent. The application of “trademark exhaustion” principles is largely unsettled
in the context of the Internet, and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations, our business
could be harmed.

As  we  expand  and  localize  our  international  activities,  we  are  increasingly  becoming  obligated  to  comply  with  the  laws  of  the  countries  or
markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to
users worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers
or one or more of our users, or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. For example, we were
found liable in France, under French law, for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve French buyers or sellers. Laws
regulating  Internet,  mobile  and  ecommerce  technologies  outside  of  the  United  States  are  generally  less  favorable  to  us  than  those  in  the  United
States. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings, and the imposition of
any regulations on us or our users may harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that
impose  conflicting  requirements  on  us  (e.g.,  in  cross-border  trade).  Our  alleged  failure  to  comply  with  foreign  laws  could  subject  us  to  penalties
ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services, in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against
such actions.

16

We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries.

We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government investigations, and other proceedings
involving  competition  and  antitrust,  intellectual  property,  privacy,  consumer  protection,  accessibility  claims,  securities,  tax,  labor  and  employment,
commercial disputes, content generated by our users, services and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have
increased as our company has grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have
increased in complexity.

The outcome and impact of such claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless
of  the  outcome,  such  investigations  and  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  of  management
resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to judgment calls. It
is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties
or  to  settle  claims  or  proceedings,  any  of  which  could  harm  our  business.  These  proceedings  could  also  result  in  reputational  harm,  criminal
sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices in
costly ways, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could harm our
business.

We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws.

We  are  subject  to  scrutiny  by  various  government  agencies  under  U.S.  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations,  including  competition  laws.  Some
jurisdictions  also  provide  private  rights  of  action  for  competitors  or  consumers  to  assert  claims  of  anti-competitive  conduct.  Other  companies  and
government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the United States,
individual states, the European Commission or other countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. An increasing number of governments are
regulating  competition  law  activities,  including  increased  scrutiny  in  large  markets  such  as  China.  Our  business  partnerships  or  agreements  or
arrangements  with  customers  or  other  companies  could  give  rise  to  regulatory  action  or  antitrust  litigation.  Some  regulators,  particularly  those
outside of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed
anticompetitive.  Certain  competition  authorities  have  conducted  market  studies  of  our  industries.  Such  claims  and  investigations,  even  if  without
foundation, may be very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in
significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices.

We are subject to patent litigation.

We have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. We are a defendant in a number of patent suits and have been
notified  of  several  other  potential  patent  disputes.  We  expect  that  we  will  increasingly  be  subject  to  patent  infringement  claims  because,  among
other reasons:

•
•
•

our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;
we continue to expand into new businesses, including through acquisitions; and
the universe of patent owners who may claim that we, any of the companies that we have acquired, or our customers infringe their patents,
and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.

Such claims  may  be brought  directly  against  us and/or  against  our customers  whom we may  indemnify  either  because we are contractually
obligated  to  do  so  or  we  choose  to  do  so  as  a  business  matter.  We  believe  that  an  increasing  number  of  these  claims  against  us  and  other
technology companies have been, and continue to be, initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition,
we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious or not,
are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business, enter into
costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements,  make  substantial  payments  to  satisfy  adverse  judgments  or  settle  claims  or  proceedings,  or  cease
conducting certain operations, which would harm our business.

17

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.

Some of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates and we have entered into agreements intended to convert the interest rate on some of
our fixed rate debt instruments to floating rates. To the extent that prevailing rates increase, our interest expense under these debt instruments will
increase.

Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of
our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities
are subject to greater interest-rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest-rate risk
than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in
market  value  if  interest  rates  increase.  Due  in  part  to  these  factors,  our  investment  income  may  decline  or  we  may  suffer  losses  in  principal  if
securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. In addition, relatively low interest rates limit our investment
income. Fluctuations in interest rates that increase the cost of our current or future indebtedness, cause the market value of our assets to decline or
reduce our investment income could adversely affect our financial results.

Our tickets business is subject to regulatory, competitive and other risks that could harm this business.

Our tickets business, which includes StubHub, is subject to numerous risks, including:

•

•
•

Some  jurisdictions,  in  particular  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States,  prohibit  the  resale  of  event  tickets  (anti-scalping  laws)  at  prices
above the face value of the tickets or at all, or highly regulate the resale of tickets, and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws
and regulations imposing these or other restrictions could limit or inhibit our ability to operate, or our users’ ability to continue to use, our
tickets business.
Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations.
In many jurisdictions, our tickets business depends on commercial partnerships with event organizers or licensed ticket vendors, which we
must develop and maintain on acceptable terms for our tickets business to be successful.

• Our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events

•

•

and live entertainment industries.
A portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on the StubHub platform is processed by StubHub in digital form. Systems failures, security
breaches,  theft  or  other  disruptions  that  result  in  the  loss  of  such  sellers’  tickets  inventory,  could  result  in  significant  costs  and  a  loss  of
consumer confidence in our tickets business.
Lawsuits  alleging  a  variety  of  causes  of  actions  have  in  the  past,  and  may  in  the  future,  be  filed  against  StubHub  and  eBay  by  venue
owners, competitors, ticket buyers, and unsuccessful ticket buyers. Such lawsuits could result in significant costs and require us to change
our business practices in ways that negatively affect our tickets business.

• Our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources, including ticketing service companies, event organizers,
ticket  brokers,  and online  and  offline  ticket  resellers.  Some  ticketing  service  companies,  event  organizers,  and professional  sports  teams
have  begun  to  issue  event  tickets  through  various  forms  of  electronic  ticketing  systems  that  are  designed  to  restrict  or  prohibit  the
transferability (and by extension, the resale) of such event tickets either to favor their own resale affiliates or to discourage resale or restrict
resale  of  season  tickets  to  a  preferred,  designated  website.  Ticketing  service  companies  have  also  begun  to  use  market-based  pricing
strategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices, and impose additional restrictions on transferability, for premium tickets.
Some sports teams have threatened to revoke the privileges of season ticket owners if they resell their tickets through a platform that is not
affiliated with, or approved by, such sports teams.

The listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeit

items, may harm our business.

The listing or sale by our users of unlawful, counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services, or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner,
has  resulted  and  may  continue  to  result  in  allegations  of  civil  or  criminal  liability  for  unlawful  activities  against  us  (including  the  employees  and
directors of our various entities) involving activities carried out by users through our services. In a number of circumstances, third parties, including
government regulators and law enforcement officials, have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws, including laws regarding
the  sale  of  counterfeit  items,  laws  restricting  or  prohibiting  the  transferability  (and  by  extension,  the  resale)  of  digital  goods  (e.g.,  event  tickets,
books, music and software), the fencing of stolen goods, selective distribution channel laws, customs laws, distance selling laws, anti-scalping laws
with respect to the resale of tickets, and the sale of items outside of the United States that are regulated by U.S. export controls.

In addition, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to counterfeit items, have resulted in threatened
and actual litigation from time to time by rights owners, including the following luxury brand owners: Tiffany & Co. in the United States; Rolex S.A.
and  Coty  Prestige  Lancaster  Group  GmbH  in  Germany;  Louis  Vuitton  Malletier  and  Christian  Dior  Couture  in  France;  and  L’Oréal  SA,  Lancôme
Parfums  et  Beauté  &  Cie,  and  Laboratoire  Garnier  &  Cie  in  several  European  countries.  Plaintiffs  in  these  and  similar  suits  seek,  among  other
remedies, injunctive relief and damages. Statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to $150,000 per copyright violation
and $2,000,000 per trademark violation in the United States, and may be even higher in other jurisdictions.  In the past, we have paid substantial
amounts  in  connection  with  resolving  certain  trademark  and  copyright  suits.  These  and  similar  suits  may  also  force  us  to  modify  our  business
practices in a manner that increases costs, lowers revenue, makes our websites and mobile platforms less convenient to customers, and requires us
to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings in order to combat these practices. In
addition, we have received significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods, which could damage our reputation,
diminish the value of our brand names, and make users reluctant to use our products and services.

We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.

Online  services  companies  may  be  subject  to  claims  relating  to  information  disseminated  through  their  services,  including  claims  alleging
defamation, libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to
the liability of online services companies for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the United
States and foreign jurisdictions. Any liabilities incurred as a result of these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation
and our business.

Our potential liability to third parties for the user-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where laws
governing Internet transactions are unsettled, may increase. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in
any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this
liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business.

Changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers could increase our costs and loss rate.

Our eBay Money Back Guarantee program represents the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded,
have  not  received  the  item  that  they  purchased  or  have  received  an  item  different  from  what  was  described.  We  expect  to  continue  to  receive
communications  from  users  requesting  reimbursement  or  threatening  or  commencing  legal  action  against  us  if  no  reimbursement  is  made.  Our
liability for these sort of claims is slowly beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non-U.S. jurisdictions than it is in
the  United  States.  Litigation  involving  liability  for  any  such  third-party  actions  could  be  costly  and  time  consuming  for  us,  divert  management
attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to adverse judgments or settlements or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affected
users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions.

19

We  may  be  unable  to  adequately  protect  or  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights,  or  third  parties  may  allege  that  we  are  infringing  their

intellectual property rights.

We  believe  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  including  our  trademarks,  patents,  copyrights,  domain  names,  trade  dress,  and  trade
secrets,  is  critical  to  our  success.  We  seek  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights  by  relying  on  applicable  laws  and  regulations  in  the  United
States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights
when offering or procuring products and services,  including confidentiality  and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees
and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.

However, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available,
and  contractual  arrangements  and  other  steps  we  have  taken  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  may  not  prevent  third  parties  from  infringing  or
misappropriating  our  intellectual  property  or  deter  independent  development  of  equivalent  or  superior  intellectual  property  rights  by  others.
Trademark,  copyright,  patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We
must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time
consuming and may not be successful in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of
our  proprietary  rights.  We  have  licensed  in  the  past,  and  expect  to  license  in  the  future,  certain  of  our  proprietary  rights,  such  as  trademarks  or
copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure
to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.

As  the  number  of  products  in  the  software  industry  increases  and  the  functionality  of  these  products  further  overlap,  and  as  we  acquire
technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, and trademark
infringement claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others.
The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of the outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time-consuming,
result  in  costly  litigation,  divert  management’s  time  and  attention  from  our  business,  require  us  to  stop  selling,  delay  roll-out,  or  redesign  our
products, or require us to pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits or to pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or
to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation or
claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business.

Failure to deal effectively with fraudulent activities on our platforms would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely

diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.

We face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our platforms and periodically receive complaints from buyers and sellers who may not
have received the goods that they had contracted to purchase or payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase. In some European
and Asian jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period. While
we  can,  in  some  cases,  suspend  the  accounts  of  users  who  fail  to  fulfill  their  payment  or  delivery  obligations  to  other  users,  we do  not  have  the
ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods, or otherwise make users whole other than through its buyer protection program, which in
the United States we refer to as the eBay Money Back Guarantee. Although we have implemented measures to detect and reduce the occurrence of
fraudulent  activities,  combat  bad  buyer  experiences  and  increase  buyer  satisfaction,  including  evaluating  sellers  on  the  basis  of  their  transaction
history  and  restricting  or  suspending  their  activity,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  these  measures  will  be  effective  in  combating  fraudulent
transactions or improving overall satisfaction among sellers, buyers, and other participants. Additional measures to address fraud could negatively
affect the attractiveness of our services to buyers or sellers, resulting in a reduction in the ability to attract new users or retain current users, damage
to our reputation, or a diminution in the value of our brand names.

20

We  have  substantial  indebtedness,  and  we  may  incur  substantial  additional  indebtedness  in  the  future,  and  we  may  not  generate  sufficient
cash flow from our business to service our indebtedness. Failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of our
indebtedness, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.

We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under
our  commercial  paper  program  and  revolving  credit  facility  or  through  public  or  private  offerings  of  debt  securities.  Our  outstanding  indebtedness
and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation, any of the following:

•

•

•
•

•

requiring  us  to  use  a  significant  portion  of  our  cash  flow  from  operations  and  other  available  cash  to  service  our  indebtedness,  thereby
reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;
our  indebtedness  and  leverage  may  increase  our  vulnerability  to  downturns  in  our  business,  to  competitive  pressures,  and  to  adverse
changes in general economic and industry conditions;
adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costs;
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases or other general corporate
and other purposes may be limited; and
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.

Our ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to
general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial
condition, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt,
we may be required to, among other things:

•
•
•
•
•

incur the tax cost of repatriating funds to the United States;
seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;
refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;
sell selected assets; or
reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.

Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not

be available on economically favorable terms or at all.

Our revolving credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain, and any debt
instruments we enter into in the future may contain, financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and
operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under, or breach any of the covenants in, a debt instrument, then the lenders would typically have the right
to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration
and required repayment of or default in respect of any of our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments,
thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of that other indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our
liquidity and financial condition.

21

A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.

Some of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from certain rating agencies. Such ratings are limited in scope and do not
purport to address all risks relating to an investment in those debt securities, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the
rating was issued. The credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and
financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that such ratings will
not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a so-called “watch list” for a possible downgrade or assigned a
negative ratings outlook if, in any rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to
buy, sell or hold any of our debt securities. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our
ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs, which could in turn
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and could harm our business.

Our credit ratings were downgraded as a result of the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders
(the “Distribution”), pursuant to which PayPal became an independent company. As of January 1, 2014, our long-term debt and short-term funding
were  rated  investment  grade  by  Standard  and  Poor’s  Financial  Services,  LLC  (long-term  rated  A,  short-term  rated  A-1,  with  a  stable  outlook),
Moody’s  Investor  Service  (long-term  rated  A2,  short-term  rated  P-1,  with  a  stable  outlook),  and  Fitch  Ratings,  Inc.  (long-term  rated  A,  short-term
rated F-1, with a stable outlook). All of these credit rating agencies lowered their ratings in connection with the Distribution, which occurred on July
17, 2015. Since July 20, 2015, we have been rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-
term  rated  A-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  Moody’s  Investor  Service  (long-term  rated  Baa1,  short-term  rated  P-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  and  Fitch
Ratings,  Inc.  (long-term  rated  BBB,  short-term  rated  F-2,  with  a  stable  outlook).  We  disclose  these  ratings  to  enhance  the  understanding  of  our
sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any further
actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as described above, will likely increase our borrowing costs.

Our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes.

The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt
tax)  to  ecommerce  businesses  and  to  our  users  is  a  complex  and  evolving  issue.  Many  of  the  fundamental  statutes  and  regulations  that  impose
these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and ecommerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes
apply  to  the  Internet  or  ecommerce.  In  addition,  governments  are  increasingly  looking  for  ways  to  increase  revenues,  which  has  resulted  in
discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues, including through indirect taxes. There are many transactions that
occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

Some jurisdictions have implemented, or may implement, laws that require remote sellers of goods and services to collect and remit taxes on
sales to customers located within the jurisdiction. On January 12, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.
et al, a case challenging the current law under which online retailers are not required to collect sales tax unless they have a physical presence in the
buyer’s  state.  If  the  current  law  is  changed,  other  states  may  adopt  laws  requiring  sellers  to  collect  and  remit  sales.  In  addition,  the  Streamlined
Sales Tax Project (an ongoing, multi-year effort by U.S. state and local governments to pursue federal legislation that would require collection and
remittance of sales tax by out-of-state sellers) could allow states that meet certain simplification and other criteria to require out-of-state sellers to
collect  and  remit  sales  taxes  on  goods  purchased  by  in-state  residents.  The  adoption  of  such  legislation  could  result  in  a  use  tax  collection
responsibility for certain of our sellers. This collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex use tax collection, remittance
and  audit  requirements  would  make  selling  on  our  websites  and  mobile  platforms  less  attractive  for  small  business  retailers  and  would  harm  our
business, and the proliferation of state legislation to expand sales and use tax collection on Internet sales could adversely affect some of our sellers
and indirectly harm our business.

There  are  proposals  that  have  been  made  at  the  U.S.  state  and  local  levels  that  would  impose  additional  taxes  on  the  sale  of  goods  and
services over the Internet. These proposals, if adopted, could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our platforms, and could diminish
our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities. While the U.S. federal government’s moratorium on state and local taxation of Internet
access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce has been permanently extended, this moratorium does not prohibit federal, state

22

or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium
and/or one of its extensions.

From time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on our
services. These notifications have not resulted in any significant tax liabilities to date, but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful in
the future, which would harm our business.

Similar issues exist outside of the United States, where the application of VAT or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers is complex and
evolving.  While  we  attempt  to  comply  in  those  jurisdictions  where  it  is  clear  that  a  tax  is  due,  some  of  our  subsidiaries  have,  from  time  to  time,
received claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees. Additionally, we pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within the
various countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various countries. However, because of our
unique business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one or
more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.

In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes on our fees and pay taxes on our purchases of goods and services. However, tax
authorities  may  raise  questions  about  our  calculation,  reporting  and  collection  of  taxes  and  may  ask  us  to  remit  additional  taxes,  as  well  as  the
proper calculation of such taxes. Should any new taxes become applicable or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient, our business could be
harmed.

Some jurisdictions have imposed a tax collection, reporting or record-keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce.
For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) now requires that certain payments to sellers be reported to the sellers and the IRS on an
annual basis. Any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our
business. Taxing authorities may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being
sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction, regardless of where the respective users are located. We are now jointly liable for UK VAT for certain
non-UK sellers who fail to fulfill their UK VAT obligations unless we suspend their eBay activity until the matter is resolved.

Some jurisdictions could assert that we are responsible for tax on the underlying goods or services sold on our sites or pass laws imposing this
obligation. Certain jurisdictions have enacted laws which will become effective in 2018 or later requiring marketplaces to report user activity or collect
and remit taxes on certain items sold on the marketplace. Imposition of an information reporting or tax collection requirement could decrease seller
or  buyer  activity  on  our  sites  and  would  harm  our  business.  Tax  authorities  may  also  require  us  to  help  ensure  compliance  by  our  users  by
promulgating  legislation  regulating  professional  sellers  or  marketplaces,  including  tax  reporting  and  collection  requirements.  In  addition,  we  have
periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our
sites,  and  in  some  cases  we  have  been  legally  obligated  to  provide  this  data.  The  imposition  of  any  requirements  on  us  to  disclose  transaction
records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers, especially requirements that are
imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce, and any use of those records to investigate, collect taxes from or prosecute sellers or
buyers, could decrease activity on our sites and harm our business.

We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there
are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject
to  tax  in  multiple  U.S.  and  foreign  jurisdictions  and  have  structured  our  operations  to  reduce  our  effective  tax  rate.  Our  determination  of  our  tax
liability  is  always  subject  to  audit  and  review  by  applicable  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities,  and  we  are  currently  undergoing  a  number  of
investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world, including with respect to our business structure. Any adverse outcome
of any such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements
and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves
based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.

In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional earning mix, by changes in the valuation of our
deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or
accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

23

In  light  of  continuing  fiscal  challenges  in certain  U.S.  states  and  in  many  countries  in Europe,  various  levels  of  government  are  increasingly
focused  on  tax  reform  and  other  legislative  action  to  increase  tax  revenue,  including  corporate  income  taxes.  A  number  of  U.S.  states  have
attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and
other  direct  business  taxes  on  companies  that  have  no  physical  presence  in  their  state,  and  taxing  authorities  in  foreign  jurisdictions  may  take
similar actions. Many U.S. states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable income or loss attributable to their
state from certain out-of-state businesses. Similarly, in Europe, and elsewhere in the world, there are various tax reform efforts underway designed
to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings. Companies that operate over the Internet, such as eBay, are a
target of some of these efforts. If more taxing authorities are successful in applying direct taxes to Internet companies that do not have a physical
presence in their respective jurisdictions, this could increase our effective tax rate.

We may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations.

One  or  more  states,  the  U.S.  federal  government  or  foreign  countries  may  seek  to  impose  reporting  or  record-keeping  obligations  on
companies  that  engage  in  or  facilitate  ecommerce.  Such  an  obligation  could  be  imposed  by  legislation  intended  to  improve  tax  compliance  (and
legislation  to  such  effect  has  been  contemplated  by  several  states  and  a  number  of  foreign  jurisdictions)  or  if  one  of  our  companies  was  ever
deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which it operates. Certain of our companies are required to report to the
IRS  and  most  states  on  customers  subject  to  U.S.  income  tax  who  receive  more  than  $20,000  in  payments  and  more  than  200  payments  in  a
calendar year. As a result, we are required to request tax identification numbers from certain payees, track payments by tax identification number
and,  under  certain  conditions,  withhold  a  portion  of  payments  and  forward  such  withholding  to  the  IRS.  We  modify  our  systems  to  meet  such
requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our user experience in connection with complying with reporting obligations.
Any  failure  by  us  to  meet  these  requirements  could  result  in  substantial  monetary  penalties  and  other  sanctions  and  could  harm  our  business.
Imposition of an information reporting requirement could decrease seller or buyer activity on our sites and would harm our business.

Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and cyberattacks.

Our  businesses  involve  the  storage  and  transmission  of  users’  personal  financial  information.  In  addition,  a  significant  number  of  our  users
authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us. An increasing number of websites, including
those  owned  by  several  other  large  Internet  and  offline  companies,  have  disclosed  breaches  of  their  security,  some  of  which  have  involved
sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable,
or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time, and often are not recognized until launched
against a target. Certain efforts may be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources and therefore may be
even  more  difficult  to  detect.  As  a  result,  we  may  be  unable  to  anticipate  these  techniques  or  to  implement  adequate  preventative  measures.
Unauthorized  parties  may  also  attempt  to  gain  access  to  our  systems  or  facilities  through  various  means,  including  hacking  into  our  systems  or
facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff. A party that is able to circumvent our security
measures could misappropriate our or our users’ personal information, cause interruption or degradations in our operations, damage our computers
or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation. In addition, our users have been and likely will continue to be targeted by parties using
fraudulent  “spoof”  and  “phishing”  emails  to  misappropriate  user  names,  passwords,  payment  card  numbers,  or  other  personal  information  or  to
introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our users’ computers. Our information technology and infrastructure may be
vulnerable to cyberattacks or security incidents and third parties may be able to access our users’ proprietary information and payment card data
that are stored on or accessible through our systems. Any security breach at a company providing services to us or our users could have similar
effects.

In  May  2014,  we  publicly  announced  that  criminals  were  able  to  penetrate  and  steal  certain  data,  including  user  names,  encrypted  user
passwords  and  other  non-financial  user  data.  Upon  making  this  announcement,  we  required  all  buyers  and  sellers  on  our  platform  to  reset  their
passwords in order to log into their account. The breach and subsequent password reset have negatively impacted the business. In July 2014, a
putative class action lawsuit was filed against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the breach. The lawsuit was recently dismissed with
leave  to  amend.  In  addition,  we  have  received  requests  for  information  and  are  subject  to  investigations  regarding  this  incident  from  numerous
regulatory and other government agencies across the world.

24

We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches.
These  issues  are  likely  to  become  more  difficult  and  costly  as  we  expand  the  number  of  markets  where  we  operate.  Additionally,  our  insurance
policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able to
fully collect, if at all, under these insurance policies.

Systems  failures  or  cyberattacks  and  resulting  interruptions  in  the  availability  of  or  degradation  in  the  performance  of  our  websites,

applications, products or services could harm our business.

Our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation due to of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-
service  and  other  cyberattacks,
 disruptions  in
 hurricanes,
telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, or other events. Our systems are also subject to
break-ins,  sabotage  and  intentional  acts  of  vandalism.  Some  of  our  systems  are  not  fully  redundant  and  our  disaster  recovery  planning  is  not
sufficient for all eventualities.

 power  losses,

 human  error,

 earthquakes,

 disasters,

 floods,

 fires,

We have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time
to time that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications. These events have resulted and
likely  will  result  in  loss  of  revenue.  A  prolonged  interruption  in  the  availability  or  reduction  in  the  speed  or  other  functionality  of  our  websites  and
mobile applications could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to
believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation
and  brands.  Moreover,  to  the  extent  that  any  system  failure  or  similar  event  results  in  damages  to  our  customers  or  their  businesses,  these
customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and
costly for us to address. We also rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties and our business may be materially adversely
affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities. In
particular, a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility that we use could cause system interruptions and delays, result in
loss of critical data and cause lengthy interruptions in our services. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for
losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.

Acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business.

We have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope, technologies, services, and products and have in July 2015
distributed 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders, pursuant to which PayPal became an independent company, and
sold our Enterprise business in November 2015. We also expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions
as  part  of  our  overall  business  strategy,  including  business  combinations,  acquisitions,  and  dispositions  of  businesses,  technologies,  services,
products, and other assets, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures.

These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:

•

•

•
•

•
•

the  potential  loss  of  key  customers,  merchants,  vendors  and  other  key  business  partners  of  the  companies  we  acquire,  or  dispose  of,
following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;
declining  employee  morale  and  retention  issues  affecting  employees  of  companies  that  we  acquire  or  dispose  of,  which  may  result  from
changes in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposed
business;
difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees;
diversion  of  management  time  and  a  shift  of  focus  from  operating  the  businesses  to  the  transaction,  and  in  the  case  of  an  acquisition,
integration and administration;
the need to provide transition services to a disposed of company, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus;
the  need  to  integrate  the  operations,  systems  (including  accounting,  management,  information,  human  resource  and  other  administrative
systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly
process;

25

•

•

•
•
•

•
•

•

the  inefficiencies  and  lack  of  control  that  may  result  if  such  integration  is  delayed  or  not  implemented,  and  unforeseen  difficulties  and
expenditures that may arise as a result;
the  need  to  implement  or  improve  controls,  procedures  and  policies  appropriate  for  a  larger  public  company  at  companies  that  prior  to
acquisition  may  have  lacked  such  controls,  procedures  and  policies  or  whose  controls,  procedures  and  policies  did  not  meet  applicable
legal and other standards;
risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;
derivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or disposition;
liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction, including intellectual property and other litigation claims
or disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and, in the
case  of  dispositions,  liabilities  to  the  acquirors  of  those  businesses  under  contractual  provisions  such  as  representations,  warranties  and
indemnities;
the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;
the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information by us or a third party acquiring assets or businesses from us, which in
and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure; and
our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes
and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statements
or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.

At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of
these  transactions  could  be  material  to  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  it  may  take  us  longer  than  expected  to  fully
realize  the anticipated  benefits  of  these  transactions,  and  those  benefits  may  ultimately  be smaller  than  anticipated  or may  not  be realized  at  all,
which  could  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operating  results.  Any  acquisitions  or  dispositions  may  also  require  us  to  issue  additional  equity
securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-
offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.

We have made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management and
operational control. The controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with
ours, and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to
our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture. Our strategic investments may also expose us to additional risks.
Any circumstances, which may be out of our control, that adversely affect the value of our investments, or cost resulting from regulatory action or
lawsuits in connection with our investments, could harm our business or negatively impact our financial results.

Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain,
and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our
business.

Our  future  performance  depends  substantially  on  the  continued  services  of  our  senior  management  and  other  key  personnel,  including  key
engineering  and  product  development  personnel,  and  our  ability  to  attract,  retain,  and  motivate  key  personnel.  Competition  for  key  personnel  is
intense, especially in the Silicon Valley where our corporate headquarters are located, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate, or
retain sufficiently qualified key personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates
often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and fluctuations in our stock price may make it
more  difficult  to  attract,  retain,  and  motivate  employees.  In  addition,  we  do  not  have  long-term  employment  agreements  with  any  of  our  key
personnel  and  do  not  maintain  any  “key  person”  life  insurance  policies.  The  loss  of  the  services  of  any  of  our  senior  management  or  other  key
personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business.

26

Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our sellers could harm our business.

A  number  of  third  parties  provide  services  to  us  or  to  our  sellers.  Such  services  include  seller  tools  that  automate  and  manage  listings,
merchant  tools  that  manage  listings  and  interface  with  inventory  management  software,  storefronts  that  help  our  sellers  list  items  and  shipping
providers  that  deliver  goods  sold  on  our  platform,  among  others.  Financial  or  regulatory  issues,  labor  issues  (e.g.,  strikes,  lockouts,  or  work
stoppages), or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our sellers could harm our business.

Price increases by, or service terminations,  disruptions  or interruptions  at, companies that provide services  to us and our sellers and clients
could  also  reduce  the  number  of  listings  on  our  platforms  or  make  it  more  difficult  for  our  sellers  to  complete  transactions,  thereby  harming  our
business. Some third parties who provide services to us or our sellers may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us
without competitive constraint. While we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance their
shipping experience,  postal rate increases  may reduce the competitiveness  of certain sellers’ offerings,  and postal service changes could require
certain sellers to utilize alternatives which could be more expensive or inconvenient, which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on our
sites, thereby harming our business.

We have outsourced certain functions to third-party providers, including some customer support and product development functions, which are
critical  to  our  operations.  If  our  service  providers  do  not  perform  satisfactorily,  our  operations  could  be  disrupted,  which  could  result  in  user
dissatisfaction and could harm our business.

There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our sellers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at
all.  If  any  third  parties  were  to  stop  providing  services  to  us  or  our  sellers  on  acceptable  terms,  including  as  a  result  of  bankruptcy,  we  may  be
unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.

Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks.

We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to
allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party
developers  will  develop  and  maintain  applications  and  services  on  our  open  platforms  on  a  timely  basis  or  at  all,  and  a  number  of  factors  could
cause  such  third-party  developers  to  curtail  or  stop  development  for  our  platforms.  In  addition,  our  business  is  subject  to  many  regulatory
restrictions.  It  is  possible  that  merchants  and  third-party  developers  who  utilize  our  development  platforms  or  tools  could  violate  these  regulatory
restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business.

We could incur significant liability if the Distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.

We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the Distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections
355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from PayPal
and  us  regarding  the  past  and  future  conduct  of  the  companies’  respective  businesses  and  other  matters.  If  any  of  these  facts,  assumptions,
representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and
could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that the
Distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or
if  it  disagrees  with  the  conclusions  in  the  opinion.  If  the  Distribution  is  determined  to  be  taxable  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes,  our
shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

We may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the Distribution.

We  entered  into  a  separation  and  distribution  agreement  and  various  other  agreements  with  PayPal  to  govern  the  Distribution  and  the
relationship of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes
between us and PayPal. The indemnity rights  we have against PayPal under the agreements  may not be sufficient  to protect  us. In addition, our
indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

San Jose, California and occupy approximately 0.5 million square feet. Our owned data centers are solely located in Utah. As of December 31, 2017

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Litigation and Other Legal Matters

Overview

We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an
indeterminate amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the
estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in
our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the
low  end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  an
estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses
arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the
probable  or  reasonably  possible  loss  or  range  of  losses  arising  from  a  proceeding,  we  have  disclosed  that  fact.  In  assessing  the  materiality  of  a
proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies
sought  by  plaintiffs  (e.g.,  injunctive  relief)  that  may  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a  manner  that  could  have  a  material  adverse
impact  on our  business.  With  respect  to the  matters  disclosed  in  this  Item  3,  we are  unable to  estimate  the possible  loss  or range  of losses  that
could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.

Amounts  accrued  for  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  for  which  we  believe  a  loss  is  probable  were  not  material  for  the  year  ended
December  31,  2017  .  Except  as  otherwise  noted  for  the  proceedings  described  in  this  Item  3,  we  have  concluded,  based  on  currently  available
information,  that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  or
settlement)  in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and
subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s
expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial condition for that reporting period could be material.

General Matters

Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.
We are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects
of our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against
our companies and/or against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject
to increased exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We
have  in  the  past  been  forced  to  litigate  such  claims.  We  may  also  become  more  vulnerable  to  third-party  claims  as  laws  such  as  the  Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our
business  (both  in  terms  of  the  range  of  products  and  services  that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  become  subject  to  laws  in
jurisdictions  where  the  underlying  laws  with  respect  to  the  potential  liability  of  online  intermediaries  like  ourselves  are  either  unclear  or  less
favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectual
property claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods
of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms.

From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our
users (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,
rules,  policies or customer/user  agreements  violate  applicable law or that we have acted  unfairly  and/or not acted  in conformity  with such prices,
rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  and  significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  are  increasing  as  the  political  and  regulatory
landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products and services that
we offer and our geographical operations) and our products and services have increased in complexity. Any claims or regulatory actions against us,
whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages for certain causes of
action in certain jurisdictions), injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change
our business

30

practices  in  expensive  ways,  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time,  result  in  the  diversion  of  significant  operational  resources  or
otherwise harm our business.

Indemnification Provisions

We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship
of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us
and  PayPal,  which  may  be  significant.  In  addition,  the  indemnity  rights  we  have  against  PayPal  under  the  agreements  may  not  be  sufficient  to
protect us and our indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These
agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become
subject as a result of their affiliation with us.

In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we
have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these
contracts,  we generally  indemnify,  hold harmless  and agree  to  reimburse  the  indemnified  party  for  losses  suffered  or incurred  by the indemnified
party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that
such  marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  for
intellectual  property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  our
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded
in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.

Dividend Policy

To date, we have not paid cash dividends on our stock.   We continually reassess our capital allocation strategy,  and evaluate a variety of

options, including share repurchases and dividends, as a means to return capital to our shareholders.

Performance Measurement Comparison

The graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return of an investment of $100 (and the reinvestment of any dividends thereafter) on
December 31, 2012 (the last trading day for the year ended December 31, 2012) in (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index, (iii) the
S&P 500 Index and (iv) the S&P Information Technology Index. For the purpose of this graph, the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common
stock  of  PayPal  Holdings,  Inc.  (“PayPal”)  to  our  stockholders,  pursuant  to  which  PayPal  became  an  independent  company,  is  treated  as  a  non-
taxable cash dividend of $41.46, an amount equal to the opening price of PayPal common stock on July 20, 2015 which was deemed reinvested in
eBay common stock at the opening price on July 20, 2015.

In July 2016, our Board authorized a $2.5 billion stock repurchase program and in July 2017, our Board authorized an additional $3.0 billion stock repurchase program.
These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization.

Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions
and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our
stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  made  through  open  market  transactions,  block  trades,  privately  negotiated  transactions  (including  accelerated  share  repurchase
transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.

During the three months ended December 31, 2017 , we repurchased approximately  $922 million  of our common stock under our July 2017 stock repurchase program.
As of December 31, 2017  , a total of approximately  $1.7 billion  remained available for future repurchases  of our common stock under our July 2017 stock repurchase
program. In January 2018, our Board authorized a $6.0 billion stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program has no expiration from the date of authorization.

We  expect,  subject to  market conditions and  other uncertainties, to  continue  making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of  our common stock.  However, our
stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of
factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

OVERVIEW

Business

eBay  Inc.  is  a  global  commerce  leader,  which  includes  our  Marketplace,  StubHub  and  Classifieds  platforms.  Our  Marketplace  platforms
include our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. Our StubHub platforms include our
online  ticket  platform  located  at  www.stubhub.com,  its  localized  counterparts  and  the  StubHub  mobile  apps.  Our  Classifieds  platforms  include  a
collection of brands such as Mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others.

Seasonality

We  expect  transaction  activity  patterns  on  our  platforms  to  mirror  general  consumer  buying  patterns  and  expect  that  these  trends  will
continue.  The  following  table  sets  forth,  for  the  periods  presented,  our  total  net  revenues  and  the  sequential  quarterly  movements  of  these  net
revenues (in millions, except percentages):

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound,
euro, Korean won and Australian dollar , subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may impact our financial results. Because of this and the fact
that we generated a majority of our net revenues internationally during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we are subject to the
risks related to doing business in foreign countries as discussed under “Item 1A: Risk Factors.”

In addition to the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management uses non-GAAP measures
in reviewing our financial results. The foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-
GAAP financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the FX-
Neutral information appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information provided in
“Non-GAAP  Measure  of  Financial  Performance,”  which  includes  reconciliations  of  FX-Neutral  financial  measures  to  the  most  directly  comparable
GAAP measures. We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current
year transactional currency amounts.

The effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2017 was due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar, in the first half of the year,
against other currencies, primarily the British pound and euro, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of the year, against
other currencies, primarily the euro.

Fiscal Year Highlights

Net  revenues  increased    7%   to    $9.6  billion   in  2017  compared  to  2016,  primarily  driven  by  Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  and
Classifieds marketing services and other revenues. FX-Neutral net revenues increased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016. Operating margin decreased
to 23.7% in 2017 compared to 25.9% in 2016.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a provisional income tax charge of $3.1 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act. In addition, in the first quarter of 2017, related to the continued realignment of our legal structure, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of the
intangible assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms and recognized a tax benefit of $695 million.

In 2017, we also received a 5.44% ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment,
resulting in a cost method investment of $725 million. The gain on disposal of our eBay India business of $167 million was recorded in interest and
other, net on our consolidated statement of income.

Also  in  2017,  we  issued  unsecured  notes  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $2.5  billion.  In  addition,  $1.5  billion  of  previously  issued

unsecured notes due in 2017 matured and were repaid.

Diluted  earnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations  decreased  to  a  loss  per  share  of  $0.95 in  2017  compared  to  earnings  per  share  of

$6.37 in 2016. We generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to  $2.8 billion  in 2016.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Revenues

We  generate  two  types  of  net  revenues:  net  transaction  revenues  and  marketing  services  and  other  (“MS&O”)  revenues.  Net  transaction
revenues are derived principally from final value fees (which are fees payable on transactions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms),
listing  fees  and  other  service  fees.  MS&O  revenues  consists  of  Marketplace,  StubHub  and  Classifieds  revenue  principally  from  the  sale  of
advertisements,  vehicles classifieds listing on Marketplace  platforms,  revenue sharing arrangements,  classifieds fees, marketing service fees and
lead referral fees. Revenues are attributed to U.S. and international geographies primarily based upon the country in which the seller, platform that
displays advertising, other service provider or customer, as the case may be, is located. To drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to our
users in the form of coupons and buyer and seller rewards. These incentives are generally treated as reductions in revenue.

 (1) We define Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) as the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms during
the applicable period regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction. We believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall
volume  of  closed  transactions  that  flow  through  our  platforms  in  a  given  period,  notwithstanding  the  inclusion  in  GMV  of  closed  transactions  that  are  not  ultimately
consummated.

(2) We define Marketplace transaction take rate as Marketplace net transaction revenues divided by Marketplace GMV.

(3) We define StubHub transaction take rate as StubHub net transaction revenues divided by StubHub GMV.

(4) We define total transaction take rate as total net transaction revenues divided by GMV.

The increase in net transaction revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in Marketplace GMV. Total transaction

take rate was flat in 2017 compared to 2016.

The  increase  in  net  transaction  revenues  in  2016  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  StubHub  GMV  and  a  higher
transaction take rate, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The total transaction take
rate was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in our StubHub transaction take rate, partially offset by a decrease in our Marketplace
transaction take rate.

Net  transaction  revenues  earned  internationally  totaled  $4.0  billion  ,  $3.8  billion  and  $3.8  billion  in  2017  ,  2016  and  2015  ,  respectively,
representing 53% , 54% and 55% of  total  net  transaction  revenues  in  the  respective  periods.  The  decrease  in  net  transaction  revenues  earned
internationally as a percentage of total net transaction revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by growth in net transaction revenues
earned  domestically  and  an  unfavorable  impact  from  foreign  currency  movements  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  The  decrease  in  net  transaction
revenues earned internationally as a percentage of total net transaction revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an unfavorable
impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

The  increase  in  Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  in  2017  compared  to  2016  was  primarily  due  to  Marketplace  GMV  growth,  partially
offset by hedging activity and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. Marketplace transaction take rate
in 2017 compared to 2016 was relatively flat.

The  increase  in  Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  in  2016  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  volume  in  local
currencies  on our Marketplace  platforms  internationally,  partially offset  by an unfavorable impact from  foreign  currency  movements  relative to the
U.S. dollar. The increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace net transaction revenue was less than the increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace GMV due to a
lower Marketplace transaction take rate. The Marketplace transaction take rate was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a shift in seller
mix and an increase in our buyer and seller incentives.

The  increase  in  StubHub  net  transaction  revenues  in  2017  compared  to  2016  was  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  StubHub  take  rate  and
StubHub GMV. The increase in StubHub transaction take rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to pricing strategies and a decrease in
our buyer incentives, which are accounted for as a reduction of revenue. The increase in StubHub GMV in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily
driven by Theater and Concerts, partially offset by Sports.

The  increase  in StubHub  net  transaction  revenues  in  2016  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  driven  by  an increase  in Sports,  Concerts  and
Theater transactions on our platform, as well as a higher StubHub transaction take rate. The increase in StubHub transaction take rate was primarily
due  to  a  change  in  mix  of  events  and  sellers  on  the  StubHub  platforms.  The  increase  in  StubHub  net  transaction  revenue  was  greater  than  the
increase in StubHub GMV due to the higher StubHub transaction take rate.

The increase in total MS&O revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues and a
favorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase in total MS&O revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was
primarily attributable to an increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues and Marketplace MS&O revenues, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from
foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

Marketplace MS&O Revenues

The increase in Marketplace MS&O revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in revenues attributable to our
first-party inventory program in Korea and, to a lesser extent, our Brands4friends online shopping community. The increase in Marketplace MS&O
revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by increased fees earned for referral services and increased revenue from our revenue
share programs, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase in fees earned
for referral services primarily consisted of fees for customers acquired and incentives for the usage of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”) products on
certain Marketplace platforms, which were not included in marketing services and other revenues prior to the distribution of 100% of the outstanding
common stock of PayPal to our stockholders (the “Distribution”).

Classifieds MS&O Revenues

The  increase  in  Classifieds  MS&O  revenues  in  2017  compared  to  2016  was  primarily  driven  by  increased  revenue  from  our  Classifieds
platforms in Germany. The increase in Classifieds MS&O revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by increased revenue from our
Classifieds platforms in our developed markets of Germany, Canada and Australia, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency
movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

Cost of Net Revenues

Cost  of  net  revenues  primarily  consists  of  costs  associated  with  customer  support,  site  operations,  and  payment  processing.  Significant
components of these costs include employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment and amortization expense,
bank  transaction  fees,  and  credit  card  interchange  and  assessment  fees.  The  following  table  presents  cost  of  net  revenues  (in  millions,  except

and increased investments in site operations. The increase in cost of net revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our continued

Cost  of  net  revenues,  net  of    $3  million   from  hedging  activities,  was  unfavorably  impacted  by  $19  million  attributable  to  foreign  currency
movements  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  in  2017  compared  to  2016.  Cost  of  net  revenues,  net  of  $4  million  from  hedging  activities,  was  favorably
impacted by $16 million due to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2016 compared to 2015.

Operating expenses, net of $8 million  from hedging activities, were unfavorably impacted by $14 million due to foreign currency movements
relative to the U.S. dollar in 2017 compared to 2016. Operating expenses, net of $3 million from hedging activities, were favorably impacted by $66
million due to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2016 compared to 2015.

Sales and Marketing

Sales  and  marketing  expenses  primarily  consist  of  advertising  and  marketing  program  costs  (both  online  and  offline),  employee
compensation,  contractor  costs,  facilities  costs  and  depreciation  on  equipment.  Online  marketing  expenses  represent  traffic  acquisition  costs  in
various  channels  such  as  paid  search,  affiliates  marketing  and  display  advertising.  Offline  advertising  primarily  includes  brand  campaigns  and
buyer/seller communications.

The  increase  in  sales  and  marketing  expense  in  2017  compared  to  2016  was  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  brand  spend  and  employee-
related costs. The increase in sales and marketing expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in marketing program costs
(both online and offline programs) partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.

Product Development

Product development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment.
Product  development  expenses  are  net  of  required  capitalization  of  major  platform  and  other  product  development  efforts,  including  the
development of our platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, and seller tools. Our top technology priorities include artificial intelligence,
voice and image technology, virtual and augmented reality and distributed commerce.

Capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $140 million and $137 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and are primarily

reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.

The increase in product development expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. The

increase in product development expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due

43

to  higher  employee-related  costs  driven  by  increased  headcount;  and  increased  depreciation  on  equipment  driven  by  capital  expenditures  as  we
continued to invest in our platform.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment,
employer  payroll  taxes  on  stock-based  compensation,  legal  expenses,  restructuring,  insurance  premiums  and  professional  fees.  Our  legal
expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.

The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased data, information security and

employee-related costs, as well as costs related to the integration of prior period acquisitions and ongoing realignment of our legal structure.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to restructuring expenses from our global
workforce reduction, costs related to the Distribution and expenses related to litigation proceedings in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. The reduction
in these expenses were partially offset by an increase in corporate costs in 2016 due to a reduction in synergies that existed prior to the Distribution.

Provision for Transaction Losses

Provision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud and
bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. We expect our provision for transaction losses to fluctuate depending on many
factors, including changes to our customer protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.

The increase in provision for transaction losses in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher customer protection program costs and
an  increase  in  costs  related  to  uncollectible  accounts.  The  decrease  in  provision  for  transaction  losses  in  2016  compared  to  2015  was  primarily
driven by lower customer protection program costs.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest  and  other,  net  primarily  consists  of  interest  earned  on  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  investments,  as  well  as  foreign  exchange
transaction  gains  and  losses,  our  portion  of  operating  results  from  investments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting,  investment
gain/loss  on  acquisitions  or  disposals  and  interest  expense,  consisting  of  interest  charges  on  any  amounts  borrowed  and  commitment  fees  on
unborrowed  amounts  under  our  credit  agreement  and  interest  expense  on  our  outstanding  debt  securities  and  commercial  paper,  if  any.  The

holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc. in 2016.

The increase in interest and other, net in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the $1.3 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of our equity
holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc., and our hedging strategy, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of senior notes
during the first quarter of 2016.

The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $3.1 billion tax charge for the impacts of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act (the “Act” or “U.S. tax reform”), enacted on December 22, 2017. Additionally, the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the increase
in our foreign tax rate as we no longer benefit from certain tax rulings and a noncash income tax charge of $376 million due to the foreign exchange
remeasurement of our deferred tax assets, partially offset by the recognition in the first quarter of 2017 of deferred tax assets of approximately $695
million .

The  decrease  in  our  effective  tax  rate  in  2016  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  due  to  the  recognition  in  2016  of  deferred  tax  assets  of
approximately $4.6 billion as a result of the realignment of our legal structure and the associated tax agreements. This was partially offset by the
$485 million tax effect on the $1.3 billion gain on the sale of our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we began the process of realigning our legal structure, subsequent to the distribution of PayPal Holdings,
Inc., to better reflect how we manage and operate our platforms. We consider many factors in effecting this realignment, including foreign exchange
exposures, long-term cash flows and cash needs of our platforms, capital allocation considerations and the associated tax effects. As a result, we
achieved a substantial step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign eBay platforms in 2016. The step-up in tax basis of our foreign
eBay platforms resulted from our election to terminate an existing tax ruling and finalize a new agreement with the foreign tax authority. In the fourth
quarter of 2016, we recognized a tax benefit of $4.6 billion, which represented the income tax effect of this step-up in tax basis. During the first half
of 2017, we recognized a noncash income tax charge of $376 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of the associated deferred tax
asset. In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms as a result of
voluntary domiciling our Classifieds intangible assets into a new jurisdiction and recognized a tax benefit of $695 million.

As a result of the realignment, we no longer benefit from tax rulings previously concluded in several different jurisdictions. Without the benefit
of  the  rulings,  the  noncash  tax  impacts  of  the  realignment  in  our  foreign  eBay  and  Classifieds  platforms  have  increased  our  income  tax  rate  in
certain  foreign  jurisdictions,  most  significantly  Switzerland.  The  higher  rate  results  from  eBay  being  subject  to  a  higher  enacted  tax  rate  for  the
foreseeable future.

While  we  experienced  a  higher  tax  rate,  the  realignment  allows  us  to  achieve  certain  cash  tax  benefits  due  to  the  step-up  in  tax  basis
achieved in certain foreign jurisdictions. We expect these foreign cash tax benefits to remain consistent, subject to the performance of our foreign
platforms  ,  for  a  period  in  excess  of  10  years.  The  realignment  is  expected  to  extend  into  2018  and  primarily  impact  our  international  entities.
However,  U.S.  tax  reform  and  the  new  U.S.  minimum  tax  on  foreign  earnings  discussed  below  will  reduce  our  expected  consolidated  cash  tax
benefits.

U.S.  tax  reform,  among  other  things,  reduces  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  rate  to  21%  from  35%  in  2018,  institutes  a  dividends  received
deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings, and creates a new U.S. minimum tax on
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We have not completed our accounting for the effects of the Act; however, we have made reasonable estimates of
those effects. Accordingly, we have recognized a provisional income tax charge of $3.1 billion , which is included as a component of the income tax
provision on our consolidated statement of income.

Included  in  the  provisional  amount  is  $1.4  billion  for  the  income  tax  on  the  deemed  repatriation  of  unremitted  foreign  earnings.  We  have
computed the amount based on information available to us; however, there is still uncertainty as to the application of the Act. Further, we have not
yet completed our analysis of the components of the tax computation.

45

The  remaining  provisional  amount  of  $1.7  billion  is  for  the  deferred  income  tax  effects  of  the  Act,  primarily  the  impact  of  the  new  U.S.
minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the reversal of our existing deferred  tax liability associated with repatriation  of
unremitted  foreign  earnings.  We  have  computed  the  amount  based  on  information  available  to  us;  however,  there  is  still  uncertainty  as  to  the
application of the Act. Further, we have not yet completed our analysis of the components of the tax computation, including a complete reconciliation
of the book and tax bases in our foreign subsidiaries . As we complete our analysis of U.S. tax reform in 2018, we may make adjustments to the
provisional amounts, which may materially impact our provision for income taxes from continuing operations in the period in which the adjustments
are made.

Our provision for income taxes differs from the provision computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower
tax  rates  associated  with  certain  earnings  from  our  operations  in  certain  lower-tax  jurisdictions  outside  the  U.S.  The  impact  on  our  provision  for
income taxes of foreign income being taxed at different rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $217 million in 2017,
$451 million in 2016 and $549 million in 2015. The foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision for
income taxes in the periods presented include Switzerland. See “Note 15 - Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this
report for more information on our tax rate reconciliation.

Our  relative  pretax  earnings  and  revenues  attributable  to  the  U.S.  as  compared  to  the  rest  of  the  world  may  differ  over  time.  In  general,
these differences are attributable to higher amortization of U.S. based intangible assets, larger stock-based compensation expense recorded in the
U.S. for U.S. based employees, overhead related to our corporate operations which are primarily U.S. based and higher average margins earned by
non-U.S.  businesses.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017,  our  U.S.  share  of  pretax  income  and  net  revenues  was  18.4%  and  42.8%  ,
respectively. The difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the U.S. as compared to the rest of the world for 2017 was
primarily due to the general drivers discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our U.S. share of pretax income and net revenues
was 41.9% and 43.1% , respectively. The difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the U.S., as compared to the rest of
the world for 2016, was primarily related to the general drivers discussed above, as well as a $979 million gain on the sale of the U.S. portion of our
equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc. in 2016.

From  time  to  time  we  engage  in  certain  intercompany  transactions.  We  consider  many  factors  when  evaluating  these  transactions.  These
transactions may impact our tax rate and/or result in additional cash tax payments. The impact in any period may be significant. These transactions
are complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate.

We  are  regularly  under  examination  by  tax  authorities  both  domestically  and  internationally.  We  believe that  adequate  amounts  have  been
reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the
inherent uncertainties in these examinations. Due to the ongoing tax examinations, we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing of
these adjustments.

Non-GAAP Measure of Financial Performance

To  supplement  our  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  we  use  FX-
Neutral  net  revenues,  which  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures.  Management  uses  the  foregoing  non-GAAP  measures  in  reviewing  our  financial
results. We define FX-Neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchange rate effect as the year-over-year
impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts.

These  non-GAAP  measures  are  not  in  accordance  with,  or  an  alternative  to,  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  and  may  be
different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting  rules  or  principles.  Non-GAAP  measures  have  limitations  in  that  they  do  not  reflect  all  of  the  amounts  associated  with  our  results  of
operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with
the corresponding GAAP measures.

These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects
for the future.  Specifically,  we believe these non-GAAP measures  provide useful information  to both management  and investors  by excluding the
foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we have
historically reported

46

certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provide consistency in our financial reporting.

The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of  $3.1 billion in 2017  was primarily due to $1.1 billion of changes in assets and
liabilities,  net  of  acquisition  effects,  and  a  net  loss  of  $1.0  billion  offset  by  adjustments  of  $1.7  billion  in  deferred  income  taxes,  $676  million  in
depreciation and amortization and $483 million in stock-based compensation.

The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.8 billion in 2016 was primarily due to net income of $7.3 billion with adjustments
for $682 million in depreciation and amortization, $416 million in stock-based compensation and $20 million in changes in assets and liabilities, net
of  acquisition  effects,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  of  $4.6  billion  related  to  deferred  income  taxes  and  $1.2  billion  related  to  gain  on  sale  of
investments.

The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.9 billion in 2015 was due primarily to net income of $1.7 billion with adjustments
for loss from discontinued operations of $222 million, $687 million in depreciation and amortization, $379 million in stock-based compensation and
$271 million in provision for transaction losses and a decrease of $195 million related to gain on sale of investments and $106 million in changes in
assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects.

Cash paid for income taxes in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $308 million , $492 million and $256 million , respectively.

Continuing Investing Activities

The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.3 billion in 2017 was primarily due to cash paid for property and equipment of $666

million and cash paid for our equity investment in Flipkart of $514 million.

The  net  cash  used  in  continuing  investing  activities  of  $2.0  billion  in  2016  was  primarily  due  to  cash  paid  for  investments  of  $11.2  billion,
property and equipment of $626 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $212 million, partially offset by proceeds of $10.1 billion
from the maturities and sales of investments.

The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $673 million in 2015 was due primarily to cash paid for purchases of investments of $6.7
billion,  purchases  of  property  and  equipment  of  $668  million  and  net  cash  paid  for  acquisition  of  businesses  of  $24  million,  partially  offset  by
proceeds of $6.8 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.

The  largely  offsetting  effects  of  purchases  of  investments  and  maturities  and  sale  of  investments  results  from  the  management  of  our

investments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate.

48

Continuing Financing Activities

The  net  cash  used  in  continuing  financing  activities  of  $1.8  billion  in  2017  was  primarily  due  to  $2.7  billion  of  cash  used  to  repurchase

common stock and $1.5 billion of cash used to repay outstanding debt, partially offset by $2.5 billion of cash proceeds from debt issuances.

The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $744 million in 2016 was primarily due to $2.9 billion of cash paid to repurchase

common stock, partially offset by $2.2 billion of proceeds from debt issuances.

The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $3.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily to cash outflows from $2.1 billion to repurchase
common stock, $850 million payment of debt upon maturity and cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $245 million related to net share
settlements  of  restricted  stock  units  and  awards.  These  cash  outflows  were  partially  offset  by  cash  inflows  of  $221  million  from  the  issuance  of
common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the effect of $74 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

The favorable effect of exchange rate movements on cash and cash equivalents was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other
currencies, primarily the euro and Korean won, during 2017. The unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates on our cash and cash equivalents
during  2016  was  due  to  the  strengthening  of  the  U.S.  dollar  against  other  currencies,  primarily  the  euro.  The  unfavorable  impact  of  currency
exchange rates on our cash and cash equivalents during 2015 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the
euro.

Stock Repurchases

In  July  2016,  our  Board  authorized  a  $2.5  billion  stock  repurchase  program  and  in  July  2017,  our  Board  authorized  an  additional  $3.0
billion  stock  repurchase  program.  These  stock  repurchase  programs  have  no  expiration  from  the  date  of  authorization.  Our  stock  repurchase
programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions
and  other  factors,  to  make  opportunistic  and  programmatic  repurchases  of  our  common  stock  to  reduce  our  outstanding  share  count.  Any  share
repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions
(including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be
funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.

During 2017 , we repurchased approximately  $2.7 billion  of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. As of  December 31,
2017 , a total of approximately $1.7 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our July 2017 repurchase program
and no amounts remained under our July 2016 repurchase program. In January 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional  $6.0 billion
 stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.

We  expect,  subject  to  market  conditions  and  other  uncertainties,  to  continue  making  opportunistic  and  programmatic  repurchases  of  our
common  stock.  However,  our  stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  limited  or  terminated  at  any  time  without  prior  notice.  The  timing  and  actual
number  of  shares  repurchased  will  depend  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  corporate  and  regulatory  requirements,  price  and  other  market
conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

Shelf Registration Statement and Long-Term Debt

As of December 31, 2017 , we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows
us to issue various types of debt securities, as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest in
shares  of  preferred  stock,  purchase  contracts  and  units  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  offerings.  Each  issuance  under  the  shelf  registration
statement  will  require  the  filing  of  a  prospectus  supplement  identifying  the  amount  and  terms  of  the  securities  to  be  issued.  The  registration
statement does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and
other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement.

Senior Notes

As of December 31, 2017 , we had floating- and fixed-rate senior notes outstanding for an aggregate principal amount of $10.1 billion . The

net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate

49

purposes,  including,  among  other  things,  capital  expenditures,  share  repurchases,  repayment  of  indebtedness  and  possible  acquisitions.  The
floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed rate notes due
2056  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  prior  to  their  maturity,  at  a  redemption  price  equal  to  100%  of  the  principal  amount  of  the  notes  to  be
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to
time  prior  to  their  maturity,  generally  at  a  make-whole  redemption  price  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  If  a  change  of  control  triggering  event
occurs  with  respect  to  the  2.500%  fixed  rate  notes  due  2018,  the  2.150%  fixed  rate  notes  due  2020,  the  3.800%  fixed  rate  notes  due  2022,  the
floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027 or the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056,
we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount
plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  For  additional  details  related  to  our  senior  notes,  please  see  “Note  11  –  Debt”  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements included in this report.

To help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we entered
into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of the fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the London InterBank
Offered  Rate  (“LIBOR”)  plus  a  spread.  These  swaps  were  designated  as  fair  value  hedges  against  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  certain  fixed  rate
senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates.

The  indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  to
exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions
with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default.

Commercial Paper

We have an up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397
days from the date of issue in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time. As of December 31, 2017 ,
there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.

Credit Agreement

In  November  2015,  we  entered  into  a  credit  agreement  that  provides  for  an  unsecured  $2 billion five-year  revolving credit facility.  We may
also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount
of $1  billion  .  Funds  borrowed  under  the  credit  agreement  may  be  used  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  acquisitions  and  other  general
corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2017 , no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have an
up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order
to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result,
$500 million of borrowing capacity was available as of December 31, 2017 for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.

Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875
percent to 1.5 percent  or (ii) a formula  based on the agent bank’s prime rate,  the federal  funds effective  rate plus  0.5 percent or LIBOR plus 1.0
percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.5 percent. The credit agreement will terminate and all
amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request
or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date
is  extended  upon  our  request,  subject  to  the  agreement  of  the  lenders.  The  credit  agreement  includes  customary  representations,  warranties,
affirmative  and  negative  covenants,  including  financial  covenants,  events  of  default  and  indemnification  provisions  in  favor  of  the  banks.  The
negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.
The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum
consolidated leverage ratio. The events of default include the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect to
us.

We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2017 .

Credit Ratings

As of December 31, 2017 , we were rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term rated BBB+, short-
term  rated  A-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  Moody’s  Investor  Service  (long-term  rated  Baa1,  short-term  rated  P-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  and  Fitch
Ratings,  Inc.  (long-term  rated  BBB,  short-term  rated  F-2,  with  a  stable  outlook).  We  disclose  these  ratings  to  enhance  the  understanding  of  our
sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any further
actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, as described above, will likely increase our borrowing costs.

Commitments and Contingencies

We  have  certain  fixed  contractual  obligations  and  commitments  that  include  future  estimated  payments  for  general  operating  purposes.
Changes  in  our  business  needs,  contractual  cancellation  provisions,  fluctuating  interest  rates,  and  other  factors  may  result  in  actual  payments
differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our
fixed contractual obligations and commitments (in millions):

The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:

•

•

Debt  amounts  include  the  principal  and  interest  amounts  of  the  respective  debt  instruments.  For  additional  details  related  to  our  debt,
please  see  “Note  11  –  Debt”  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report.  This  table  does  not  reflect  any  amounts
payable under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstanding
as of December 31, 2017 .

Lease  amounts  include  minimum  rental  payments  under  our  non-cancelable  operating  leases  for  office  facilities,  fulfillment  centers,  as
well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual
terms  and  are  not  expected  to  differ  significantly  from  actual  results  under  our  existing  leases,  unless  a  substantial  change  in  our
headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.

Purchase  obligation  amounts  include  minimum  purchase  commitments  for  advertising,  capital  expenditures  (computer  equipment,
software  applications,  engineering  development  services,  construction  contracts)  and  other  goods  and  services  entered  into  in  the
ordinary course of business.

As  we  are  unable  to  reasonably  predict  the  timing  of  settlement  of  liabilities  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  net,  the  table  does  not

include $481 million of such non-current liabilities included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 .

Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-
term  non-equity  investments,  in  an  aggregate  amount  of  $11.3  billion  and  $11.0  billion  ,  respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2017  ,  this  amount
included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $9.1 billion . As a result of U.S. tax reform, the $9.1 billion held by our
non-U.S. subsidiaries was subject to current tax in the U.S. in 2017. As of December 31, 2017 , we had not repatriated any of these funds to the
U.S. However, to the extent we repatriate these funds to the U.S., we will be required to pay income taxes in certain U.S.

51

states  and  applicable  foreign  withholding  taxes  on  those  amounts  during  the  period  when  such  repatriation  occurs.  We  have  accrued  provisional
deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.

We actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of
principal  and  secondarily  on  improving  yield  on  these  assets.  We  diversify  our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  investments  among  various
counterparties  in  order  to  reduce  our  exposure  should  any  one  of  these  counterparties  fail  or  encounter  difficulties.  To  date,  we  have  not
experienced  any  material  loss  or  lack  of  access  to  our  invested  cash,  cash  equivalents  or  short-term  investments;  however,  we  can  provide  no
assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial
markets.  At  any  point  in  time  we  have  funds  in  our  operating  accounts  and  customer  accounts  that  are  deposited  and  invested  with  third  party
financial institutions.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated
from  operations,  borrowings  available  under  our  credit  agreement  and  commercial  paper  program,  and  our  access  to  capital  markets,  will  be
sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2017 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material

effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

We  have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cash
withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“Aggregate
Cash Deposits”). This arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net
balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense
or  income  under  the  arrangement.  As  of  December  31,  2017  ,  we  had  a  total  of  $1.9  billion  in  cash  withdrawals  offsetting  our  $2.1  billion  in
Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.

Indemnification Provisions

We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship
of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us
and  PayPal,  which  may  be  significant.  In  addition,  the  indemnity  rights  we  have  against  PayPal  under  the  agreements  may  not  be  sufficient  to
protect us and our indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These
agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become
subject as a result of their affiliation with us.

In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we
have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these
contracts,  we generally  indemnify,  hold harmless  and agree  to  reimburse  the  indemnified  party  for  losses  suffered  or incurred  by the indemnified
party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that
such  marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  for
intellectual  property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  our
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded
in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates

General

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our
senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are
highly uncertain at the time the estimate  is made, and if different  estimates  that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting
estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  believe  the  following
critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
The  following  descriptions  of  critical  accounting  policies,  judgments  and  estimates  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  consolidated  financial
statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report.

Revenue Recognition

We  may  enter  into  certain  revenue  transactions,  primarily  related  to  certain  advertising  contracts,  that  are  considered  multiple  element
arrangements (arrangements with more than one deliverable). We also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and/or services from certain
customers. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions
including: (1) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple deliverables; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-
alone selling price of each deliverable; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as eBay is acting as a principal), or net (as eBay is acting as
an agent); (4) when we provide cash consideration to our customers, determining whether we are receiving an identifiable benefit that is separable
from the customer’s purchase of our products and/or services and for which we can reasonably estimate fair value; and (5) whether the arrangement
would  be  characterized  as  revenue  or  reimbursement  of  costs  incurred.  Changes  in  judgments  with  respect  to  these  assumptions  and  estimates
could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.

Income Taxes

Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory  tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in
which  we  operate.  Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective  government  taxing  authorities.
Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our
tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates
that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings
are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our
future operations. As a result of U.S. tax reform and the current U.S. taxation of deemed repatriated earnings, management has no specific plans to
indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at the balance sheet date.

Deferred  tax  assets  represent  amounts  available  to  reduce  income  taxes  payable  on  taxable  income  in  future  years.  Such  assets  arise
because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable
income  from  all sources,  including reversal  of taxable temporary  differences,  forecasted  operating earnings  and available tax planning strategies.
These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and
long-range business forecasts. As of December 31, 2017 , we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment
that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

53

We  recognize  and  measure  uncertain  tax  positions  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  U.S.,  or  GAAP,
pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination  by  the  taxing  authorities,  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.  The  tax  benefits  recognized  in  the  financial  statements  from
such  positions  are  then  measured  based  on  the  largest  benefit  that  has  a  greater  than  50  percent  likelihood  of  being  realized  upon  ultimate
settlement.  We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in
the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We  file  annual  income  tax  returns  in  multiple  taxing  jurisdictions  around  the  world.  A  number  of  years  may  elapse  before  an  uncertain  tax
position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution
of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, as
well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the
use of cash.

The following table illustrates our effective tax rates for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory
rates  and  higher  than  anticipated  in  countries  where  we  have  higher  statutory  rates,  by  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  or
liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination
of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of
adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

Based  on  our  results  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017  ,  a  one-percentage  point  change  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  as  a
percentage  of  income  before  taxes  would  have  resulted  in  an  increase  or  decrease  in the  provision  of  approximately  $23 million , resulting in an
approximate $0.02 change in diluted earnings per share.

We have accounted for the tax effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, on a provisional basis. Our accounting
for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but we have determined reasonable estimates for those effects. Our reasonable estimates are included
in  our  financial  statements  as  of  December  31,  2017.   We  expect  to  complete  our  accounting  during  the  one  year  measurement  period  from  the
enactment date.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with
the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments
and  estimates.  These  judgments  can  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  cash  flows  that  an  asset  is  expected  to  generate  in  the  future  and  the
appropriate weighted average cost of capital.

As  of  December  31,  2017  ,  our  goodwill  totaled  $4.8  billion  and  our  identifiable  intangible  assets,  net  totaled  $69  million  .  We  assess  the
impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is
more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  value.  If  the  reporting  unit  does  not  pass  the  qualitative
assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market
and  discounted  cash  flow  approaches.  Goodwill  is  considered  impaired  if  the  carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value.  The
discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. The market approach uses comparable company information to determine
revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting

54

units. Failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted
our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 . Additionally, we evaluated impairment based on the significant activities
regarding  the  Distribution  and  Enterprise  divestiture  in  2015.  See  “Note  4  -  Discontinued  Operations”  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements
included in this report for further detail. As of December 31, 2017 , we determined that no further impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for any
reporting units was required. See “Note 5 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Legal Contingencies

In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, and
provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement  of income. These estimates  have been based on our assessment  of the
facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.

From time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involved
in  legal  proceedings,  some  of  which  are  discussed  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors,”  “Item  3:  Legal  Proceedings”  and  “Note  12  -  Commitments  and
Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against
us, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require
significant amounts of management’s time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain
claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a
significant part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result

from changes in interest rates.

As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 17% of our total cash and investments was held in cash and cash equivalents. As such, changes in
interest rates will impact interest income. As discussed below, fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise
in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest
rates.

As  of  December  31,  2017  ,  the  balance  of  our  corporate  debt  and  government  bond  securities  was  $9.2  billion  ,  which  represented
approximately 75% of  our  total  cash  and  investments.  Investments  in  both  fixed-rate  and  floating-rate  interest-earning  instruments  carry  varying
degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates.
In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest-rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate
securities generally are subject to less interest-rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if
interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our investment income
may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest
rates.  A  100  basis  point  increase  or  decrease  in  interest  rates  would  not  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  assets  or  liabilities  as  of
December 31, 2017 .

As of December 31, 2017 , we have an aggregate principal amount of $10.1 billion of outstanding senior notes, of which 92% bore interest at
fixed rates. We entered into $2.4 billion of interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations
associated with $1.15 billion of our 2.200% senior notes due July 2019, $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021, and $500 million of
our  3.450%  senior  notes  due  July  2024  so  that  the  interest  payable  on  those  notes  effectively  became  variable  based  on  LIBOR  plus  a  spread.
Further  changes  in interest  rates  will impact  interest  expense  on  any  borrowings  under  our  revolving  credit  facility,  which  bear  interest  at  floating
rates, and the interest rate on any commercial paper borrowings we make and any debt securities we may issue in the future and, accordingly, will
impact interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, please see “Note 11 – Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included in

Investment Risk

The  primary  objective  of  our  investment  activities  is  to  preserve  principal  while  at  the  same  time  improving  yields  without  significantly
increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of asset types,
including bank deposits, government bonds and corporate debt securities.

As of December 31, 2017 , our cost and equity method investments totaled $885 million , which represented approximately 7% of our total
cash  and  investments,  and  were  primarily  related  to  cost  method  investments  in  privately  held  companies.  We  review  our  investments  for
impairment  when  events  and  circumstances  indicate  a  decline  in  fair  value  of  such  assets  below  carrying  value  is  other-than-temporary.  Our
analysis  includes  a review  of  recent  operating  results  and  trends,  recent  sales/acquisitions  of  the  securities  in which  we  have  invested  and other
publicly available data.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our  commerce  platforms  operate  globally,  resulting  in  certain  revenues  and  costs  that  are  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  primarily  the
British pound, euro, Korean won and Australian dollar , subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. We
transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international
subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow, results of operations
and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may
record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities.

56

We  have  a  foreign  exchange  exposure  management  program  designed  to  identify  material  foreign  currency  exposures,  manage  these
exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the
purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts is
at times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see “Note 9
– Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.
Most of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the
derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into
earnings  in  the  same  period  the  forecasted  transaction  affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  these
contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the derivative’s
gain or loss is recognized immediately in earnings in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain revenue and costs are eligible for
cash flow hedge accounting.

The following table illustrates  the fair values of outstanding  foreign exchange contracts  designated as cash flow hedges and the before-tax
effect  on  fair  values  of  a  hypothetical  adverse  change  in  the  foreign  exchange  rates  that  existed  as  of  December  31,  2017  .  The  sensitivity  for
foreign currency contracts is based on a 20% adverse change in foreign exchange rates, against relevant functional currencies.

Since our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes in

the value of the underlying exposure.

Subsequent to the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders, fewer of our currency flows met the
GAAP criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, thus requiring us to use a combination of foreign exchange derivative contracts and investing non-
U.S. cash in U.S. denominated investments to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. The recent realignment of our legal structure has resulted in an increase in currency flows, beginning in the third quarter of 2017,
that met the GAAP criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, thus minimizing the need to invest non-U.S. cash in U.S. denominated investments to
protect  both  our  forecasted  revenue  flows  and  U.S.  dollar  equivalent  earnings  from  adverse  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.
Accordingly, $28 million in qualifying hedging activity was netted against marketplace net transaction revenues in the second half of 2017.

In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
than  the  functional  currency  of  our  subsidiaries.  These  contracts  reduce,  but  do  not  entirely  eliminate,  the  impact  of  currency  exchange  rate
movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other, net,
which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts.

We  considered  the  historical  trends  in  currency  exchange  rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  in
exchange  rates  of  20%  for  all  currencies  could  be  experienced  in  the  near  term.  These  changes  would  have  resulted  in  an  adverse  impact  on
income before income taxes of approximately $11 million as of December 31, 2017 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange
forwards in place as of December 31, 2017 .

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  eBay  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  as  of  December  31,  2017  and  2016,  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2017,  including  the  related  notes  and  schedule  of  valuation  and  qualifying  accounts  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2017
appearing  under  Item  15(a)(2)  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  “consolidated  financial  statements”).  We  also  have  audited  the  Company's  internal  control  over
financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2017,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  annual  report  on  internal  control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over
financial  reporting  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)
(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our  audits  of the  consolidated  financial statements  included performing  procedures  to assess the risks of  material  misstatement  of the  consolidated  financial
statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,
evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures in the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also included  evaluating  the  accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness
exists, and  testing and evaluating  the design  and operating  effectiveness  of internal control  based on the  assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

eBay Inc.

Note 1 – The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company

eBay  Inc.  is  a  global  commerce  leader,  which  includes  our  Marketplace,  StubHub  and  Classifieds  platforms.  Our  Marketplace  platforms
include our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. Our StubHub platforms include our
online ticket platform located at www.stubhub.com, the StubHub mobile apps and Ticketbis. Our Classifieds platforms include a collection of brands
such as Mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others.

When  we  refer  to  “we,”  “our,”  “us”  or  “eBay”  in  this  document,  we  mean  the  current  Delaware  corporation  (eBay  Inc.)  and  its  California

predecessor, as well as all of our consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.

In 2015, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”) to our stockholders (the
“Distribution”) and closed the sale of our former Enterprise segment (“Enterprise”). As a result, the financial results and related assets and liabilities
of  PayPal  and  Enterprise  were  retrospectively  reflected  as  discontinued  operations  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  and  consolidated
balance sheet. See “Note 4 - Discontinued Operations” for additional information.

Use of estimates

The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction losses, legal contingencies, income taxes, revenue
recognition, stock-based compensation, goodwill and the recoverability of intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation

The  accompanying  financial  statements  are  consolidated  and  include  the  financial  statements  of  eBay  Inc.,  our  wholly  and  majority-owned
subsidiaries  and  variable  interest  entities  (“VIE”)  where  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been
eliminated in consolidation. Minority interests are recorded as a noncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidation
requirement for VIEs. Investments in entities where we hold at least a 20% ownership interest and have the ability to exercise significant influence,
but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investees’ results
of operations is included in interest and other, net and our investment balance is included in long-term investments. Investments in entities where we
hold less than a 20% ownership interest are generally accounted for using the cost method of accounting, and our share of the investees’ results of
operations is included in our consolidated statement of income to the extent dividends are received.

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet to conform with current year presentation. We have

evaluated all subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.

Revenue recognition

We generate net transaction revenues primarily from final value fees and listing fees paid by sellers. Final value fee revenues are recognized
at the time that the transaction is successfully closed, while listing fee revenues are recognized ratably over the estimated period of the listing. An
auction transaction is considered successfully closed when at least one buyer has bid above the seller’s specified minimum price or reserve price,
whichever is higher, at the end of the transaction term.

Our  marketing  services  revenues  are  derived  principally  from  the  sale  of  advertisements,  revenue  sharing  arrangements,  classifieds  fees,
marketing service fees and lead referral fees. Our advertising revenues are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements. The duration
of our advertising contracts has ranged from one week to five years, but is generally one week to one year. Advertising revenues on contracts are
recognized as “impressions” (i.e., the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) are delivered, or as
“clicks” (which are generated each time users on our platforms click through our advertisements to an advertiser’s designated website) are provided
to advertisers. For contracts with minimum monthly or quarterly advertising commitments where the fee and commitments are fixed throughout the
term,  we  recognize  revenue  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  agreement.  We  also  may  enter  into  arrangements  to  purchase  services  from  certain
customers and if the service is not considered an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer’s purchase of our services or for which we
cannot  reasonably  estimate  fair  value,  the  fees  paid  to  the  customer  are  recorded  as  a  reduction  in  revenue.  Some  of  our  advertising  contracts
consist  of  multiple  elements  which  generally  include  a  blend  of  various  impressions  and  clicks  as  well  as  other  marketing  deliverables.  Where
neither  vendor-specific  objective  evidence  nor  third-party  evidence  of  selling  price  exists,  we  use  management’s  best  estimate  of  selling  price
(“BESP”) to allocate arrangement consideration on a relative basis to each element. BESP is generally based on the selling prices of the various
elements  when  they  are  sold  to  customers  of  a  similar  nature  and  geography  on  a  stand-alone  basis  or  estimated  stand-alone  pricing  when  the
element  has  not  previously  been  sold  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  These  estimates  are  generally  based  on  pricing  strategies,  market  factors  and
strategic  objectives.  Revenues  related  to  revenue  sharing  arrangements  are  recognized  based  on  revenue  reports  received  from  our  partners,
provided  that  collectability  is  reasonably  assured.  Revenues  related  to  fees  for  listing  items  on  our  Classifieds  platforms  are  recognized  over  the
estimated  period of the classified listing. Lead referral  fee revenue is generated from lead referral fees based on the number of times users click
through to a merchant’s website from our platforms. Lead referral fees are recognized in the period in which a user clicks through to the merchant’s
website.

Our other revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide services to our users. Revenues from

contractual arrangements with third parties are recognized as the contracted services are delivered to end users.

To drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to our users in the form of coupons and buyer and seller rewards. These incentives are

generally treated as reductions in revenue.

Internal use software and platform development costs

Direct  costs  incurred  to  develop software  for  internal  use  and platform  development  costs  are  capitalized  and amortized  over  an estimated
useful life of one to five years. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we capitalized costs, primarily related to labor and stock-
based compensation, of $140 million and $137 million , respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $156 million , $149 million
and  $110  million  for  2017  ,  2016  and  2015  ,  respectively.  Costs  related  to  the  design  or  maintenance  of  internal  use  software  and  platform
development are expensed as incurred.

Advertising expense

We expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in
the period during which the advertising space or airtime is used, in each case as sales and marketing expense. Internet advertising expenses are
recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered
over  the  total  number  of  contracted  impressions,  on  a  pay-per-click  basis,  or  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  contract.  Advertising
expense totaled $1.3 billion , $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Stock-based compensation

We  have  equity  incentive  plans under  which  we  grant  equity  awards,  including  stock  options,  restricted  stock  units  (“RSUs”),  performance-
based  restricted  stock  units,  and  performance  share  units,  to  our  directors,  officers  and  employees.  We  primarily  issue  RSUs.  We  determine
compensation  expense  associated  with  RSUs  based  on  the  fair  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant.  We  determine  compensation
expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally
recognize  compensation  expense  using  a  straight-line  amortization  method  over  the  respective  vesting  period  for  awards  that  are  ultimately
expected  to  vest.  Accordingly,  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  2017 , 2016 and 2015 has  been  reduced  for  estimated  forfeitures.  When
estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. We recognize a benefit or provision
from  stock-based  compensation  in  earnings  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense  to  the  extent  that  an  incremental  tax  benefit  or  deficiency  is
realized  by  following  the  ordering  provisions  of  the  tax  law.  In  addition,  we  account  for  the  indirect  effects  of  stock-based  compensation  on  the
research tax credit and the foreign tax credit through our consolidated statement of income.

Provision for transaction losses

Provision  for  transaction  losses  consists  primarily  of  losses  resulting  from  our  customer  protection  programs,  fraud  and  bad  debt  expense
associated  with  our  accounts  receivable  balance.  Provisions  for  these  items  represent  our  estimate  of  actual  losses  based  on  our  historical
experience and many other factors including changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes as well as economic
conditions.

Income taxes

We  account  for  income  taxes  using  an  asset  and  liability  approach,  which  requires  the  recognition  of  taxes  payable  or  refundable  for  the
current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements
or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future
changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits
that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence.

We  report  a  liability  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  resulting  from  uncertain  tax  positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  We

recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We have accounted for the tax effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, on a provisional basis. Our accounting
for certain income tax effects is incomplete, but we have determined reasonable estimates for those effects. Our reasonable estimates are included
in  our  financial  statements  as  of  December  31,  2017.   We  expect  to  complete  our  accounting  during  the  one  year  measurement  period  from  the
enactment date.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and are

primarily comprised of bank deposits and certificates of deposit.

Allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits

We record our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors. We consider historical experience, the age of
the  accounts  receivable  balances,  current  economic  conditions  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  our  customers’  ability  to  pay.  The  allowance  for
doubtful accounts and authorized credits was $102 million and $81 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

Investments

Short-term  investments,  which  may  include  marketable  equity  securities,  time  deposits,  certificates  of  deposit,  government  bonds  and
corporate debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year when purchased, are classified as available-for-
sale and are reported at fair value using the specific

F-10

eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss),
net of related estimated income tax provisions or benefits.

Long-term  investments  may  include  marketable  government  bonds  and  corporate  debt  securities,  time  deposits,  certificates  of  deposit  and
cost and equity method investments. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using the specific identification
method.  Unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  our  available-for-sale  investments  are  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported  as  a  component  of  other
comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated income tax provisions or benefits.

Our  equity  method  investments  are  primarily  investments  in  privately-held  companies.  Our  consolidated  results  of  operations  include,  as  a
component  of  interest  and  other,  net,  our  share  of  the  net  income  or  loss  of  the  equity  method  investments.  Our  share  of  investees’  results  of
operations  is  not  significant  for  any  period  presented.  Our  cost  method  investments  consist  of  investments  in  privately  held  companies  and  are
recorded at cost. Amounts received from our cost method investees were not material to any period presented.

We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market
conditions. With respect to our debt securities, this assessment takes into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, our intent to sell
the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether we
expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, whether a credit loss exists).

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally, one to three years for computer equipment and software, up to thirty  years for buildings and
building  improvements,  the  shorter  of  five years  or  the  term  of  the  lease  for  leasehold  improvements  and  three years  for  furniture,  fixtures  and
vehicles.

Goodwill and intangible assets

Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A qualitative
assessment can be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If
the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of
the reporting units are estimated using income and market approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds  its  fair  value.  The  discounted  cash  flow  method,  a  form  of  the  income  approach,  uses  expected  future  operating  results  and  a  market
participant discount rate. The market approach uses comparable company prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions
(either publicly traded entities or merger and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results
of  our  reporting  units.  Failure  to  achieve  these  expected  results,  changes  in  the  discount  rate  or  market  pricing  metrics  may  cause  a  future
impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 . Additionally, we
evaluated impairment based on the significant activities regarding the Distribution and Enterprise divestiture during 2015. See “Note 4 - Discontinued
Operations”  for  further  detail.  As a result  of this  test,  we determined  that  no further  adjustment  to the carrying  value of goodwill for  any reporting
units was required.

Intangible assets consist of purchased customer lists and user base, marketing related, developed technologies and other intangible assets,
including patents and contractual agreements.  Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method
and estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.

Impairment of long-lived assets

We  evaluate  long-lived  assets  (including  intangible  assets)  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the
carrying  amount  of  a  long-lived  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  An  asset  is  considered  impaired  if  its  carrying  amount  exceeds  the  undiscounted
future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , no impairment was noted.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Foreign currency

Most  of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  use  the  local  currency  of  their  respective  countries  as  their  functional  currency.  Assets  and  liabilities  are
translated  into  U.S.  dollars  using  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  while  revenues  and  expenses  are  translated  at  average
exchange rates during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of our consolidated balance sheet are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income.

Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as interest and other, net.

Derivative instruments

We use derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, options and swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
We may also use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. We
do  not  use  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading  purposes.  See  “Note  9  -  Derivative  Instruments”  for  a  full  description  of  our  derivative
instrument activities and related accounting policies.

Concentration of credit risk

Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative instruments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and
cash equivalents are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Our accounts receivable are derived from
revenue earned from customers. In each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , no customer accounted for more than 10% of net
revenues.  Our  derivative  instruments  expose  us  to  credit  risk  to  the  extent  that  our  counterparties  may  be  unable  to  meet  the  terms  of  the
agreements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In  2016,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  new  guidance  to  revise  certain  aspects  of  stock-based  compensation
guidance  which  includes  income  tax  consequences,  classification  of  awards  as  equity  or  liabilities,  and  classification  on  the  statement  of  cash
flows.  We  adopted  the  new  standard  in  the  first  quarter  of  2017.  Adoption  of  this  standard  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated
financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current GAAP guidance
on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition guidance provides a unified model to determine when and
how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In 2016,
the FASB issued several amendments to the standard, including principal versus agent considerations when another party is involved in providing
goods or services to a customer and the application of identifying performance obligations.

The Company will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective transition method and recast each prior reporting

period presented.

Under the new standard, we identified one performance obligation related to the core service offered to sellers in our Marketplace platform
and  believe  additional  services  mainly  to  promote  or  feature  listings  at  the  option  of  sellers  are  not  distinct  within  the  context  of  the  contract.
Accordingly,  certain  fees  paid  by  sellers  for  these  services  will  be  recognized  when  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  or  when  the
contract expires resulting, in some cases, in a change in the timing of recognition from current guidance. In addition, we made the policy election to
consider  delivery  of  tickets  in  our  StubHub  business  to  be  fulfillment  activities  and  consequently,  the  performance  obligation  is  considered  to  be
satisfied upon payment to sellers. We believe the impact of this policy election will allow an acceleration of revenue recognition for certain users .
The total impact resulting from the change in timing of recognition for both the Marketplace and StubHub platforms is expected to be a net decrease
in transaction revenue of less than $2 million for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively and increase in deferred revenue of $20 million and $19
million

F-12

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Revenue recognition related to our marketing services and other revenue derived principally from the sale of advertisements, revenue sharing
arrangements,  and  marketing  services  fees  will  substantially  remain  unchanged  partially  due  to  the  fact  that  the  principal  versus  agent
considerations  under  ASU  2016-08  Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers  (Topic  606):  Principal  versus  Agent  Considerations  (Reporting
Revenue Gross versus Net) will not materially change how we currently present revenue. Further, we believe certain incentives such as coupons
and  rewards  provided  to  certain  users  from  which  we  do  not  earn  revenue  within  the  context  of  the  identified  contract  of  $363  million  and $322
million for  fiscal  year  2017  and  2016,  respectively,  should  be  recognized  as  sales  and  marketing  expense,  which  historically  were  recorded  as  a
reduction of revenue under current guidance.

Adoption  of  this  guidance  is  expected  to  have  the  following  impact  on  select  financial  statement  line  items  for  the  periods  presented  (in

millions):

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the
presentation  and  disclosure  requirements  for  financial  instruments.  In  addition,  the  FASB  clarified  guidance  related  to  the  valuation  allowance
assessment  when  recognizing  deferred  tax  assets  resulting  from  unrealized  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities.  The  new  standard  is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We anticipate that the adoption of the
new  standard  will  increase  the  volatility  of  our  other  income  (expense),  net,  as  a  result  of  the  remeasurement  of  our  equity  and  cost  method
investments. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements at
adoption.

In  2016,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  related  to  accounting  for  leases.  The  new  guidance  requires  the  recognition  of  lease  assets  and
lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard is effective for fiscal years,
and  interim  periods  within  those  fiscal  years,  beginning  after  December  15,  2018.  We  are  evaluating  the  impact  of  adopting  this  new  accounting
guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at
the  net  amount  expected  to  be  collected,  not  based  on  incurred  losses.  Further,  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  should  be
recorded through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. The new standard is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance
on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash
flows,  including  debt  prepayment  or  extinguishment  costs,  settlement  of  contingent  consideration  arising  from  a  business  combination,  insurance
settlement proceeds, and distributions from certain equity method investees. Additionally, the FASB issued new guidance to include restricted cash
with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-the-period and end-of-the-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash
flows. The new standards are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We will
adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset,
other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. This removes the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party.
This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual
reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. It is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment
to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact
on our consolidated financial statements at adoption.

In  2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  that  narrows  the  application  of  when  an  integrated  set  of  assets  and  activities  is  considered  a
business and provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present to be considered a
business. It is expected that the new guidance will reduce the number of transactions that would need to be further evaluated and accounted for as
a  business.  This  standard  is  effective  for  annual  reporting  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2017,  including  interim  reporting  periods  within
those  annual  reporting  periods,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  We  anticipate  that  the  adoption  of  the  new  guidance  will  impact  management’s
consideration of strategic investments upon adoption in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements at
adoption.

In  2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  simplify  the  subsequent  measurement  of  goodwill  by  removing  the  requirement  to  perform  a
hypothetical  purchase  price  allocation  to  compute  the  implied  fair  value  of  goodwill  to  measure  impairment.  Instead,  any  goodwill  impairment  will
equal  the  amount  by  which  a  reporting  unit’s  carrying  value  exceeds  its  fair  value,  not  to  exceed  the  carrying  amount  of  goodwill.  Further,  the
guidance eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it
fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment
test in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We do
not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the scope and application of the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets to noncustomers,
including partial sales and also defines what constitutes an “in substance nonfinancial asset” which can include financial assets. The new guidance
eliminates several accounting differences between transactions involving assets and transactions involving businesses. Further, the guidance aligns
the  accounting  for  derecognition  of  a  nonfinancial  asset  with  that  of  a  business.  This  standard  is  effective  for  annual  reporting  periods  beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of
2018 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements at adoption.

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that will shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium to the
earliest call date to more closely align with expectations incorporated in market pricing. The new guidance will not impact debt securities held at a
discount.  Adoption  of  this  standard  will  be  made  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis  through  a  cumulative-effect  adjustment  directly  to  retained
earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim reporting  periods within those annual reporting  periods, with early adoption permitted.  While we continue to assess the potential
impact of this standard, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In  2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  amend  the  scope  of  modification  accounting  for  share-based  payment  arrangements.  The
amendments in the update provide guidance on types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards would be required to
apply  modification  accounting  under  ASC  718,  Compensation-Stock  Compensation.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  reporting  periods
beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2018.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In  2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  simplify  the  application  of  the  hedge  accounting  guidance  in  current  GAAP  and  improve  the
financial  reporting  of  hedging  relationships  by  allowing  entities  to  better  align  its  risk  management  activities  and  financial  reporting  for  hedging
relationships  through  changes  to  both  designation  and  measurement  for  qualifying  hedging  relationships  and  the  presentation  of  hedge  results.
Further,  the new guidance allows more  flexibility  in the  requirements  to qualify and maintain  hedge accounting.  The new standard  is effective  for
fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2018,  and  interim  periods  with  early  adoption  permitted.  We  will  early  adopt  this  guidance  in  the  first
quarter of 2018 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements at adoption.

Note 2 – Net Income (loss) Per Share

Basic  net  income  (loss)  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  for  the  period  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding
options and equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of
diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares.

The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in millions, except per share amounts):

Numerator:

Income (loss) from continuing operations

Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes

Acquisition activity in 2017 was immaterial. During 2016, we completed  six acquisitions – Cargigi Inc., Expertmaker, SalesPredict, Ticketbis,
Ticket  Utils  and  Corrigon  Ltd.  –  for  an  aggregate  purchase  consideration  of  approximately    $212  million  ,  consisting  of  cash.  We  believe  these
acquisitions will help us build a better user experience, improve discoverability and grow our international presence.

The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  operating  results  of  acquired  businesses  from  the  date  of  each  acquisition.  Pro  forma

results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because the effect of the acquisitions were not material to our financial results.

Note 4 — Discontinued Operations

On  June  26,  2015,  our  Board  approved  the  separation  of  PayPal  through  the  Distribution.  To  consummate  the  Distribution,  our  Board
declared a pro rata dividend of PayPal Holdings, Inc. common stock to eBay’s stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015
(the “Record Date”). Each eBay stockholder received one ( 1 ) share of PayPal Holdings, Inc. common stock for every share of eBay common stock
held at the close of business on the Record Date. The Distribution occurred on July 17, 2015. Immediately following the Distribution, PayPal became
an independent, publicly traded company listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker “PYPL.” eBay continues to trade on The NASDAQ
Stock  Market  under  the  ticker  “EBAY.”  We  classified  the  financial  results  of  PayPal  as  discontinued  operations  in  our  consolidated  statement  of
income. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations were classified as discontinued operations in our
consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the Distribution, we reviewed our capital allocation strategy to ensure that each of PayPal and eBay
would be well capitalized at Distribution. As part of this strategy, we contributed approximately $3.8 billion of cash to PayPal in 2015.

In 2015, our Board approved a plan to sell Enterprise.  Based on the expected sales proceeds, we recorded a goodwill impairment  of $786
million in 2015. On July 16, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Enterprise for $925 million and on November 2, 2015, the sale closed. We
recorded  a  loss  of  $35  million  upon  closing  included  within  income  (loss)  from  discontinued  operations,  net  of  income  taxes.  We  classified  the
results  of  Enterprise  as  discontinued  operations  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income.  Additionally,  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  were
classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet.

Restricted cash is held primarily in interest bearing accounts for letters of credit primarily related to our global sabbatical program and various
lease  arrangements.  Our  fixed-income  investments  consist  of  predominantly  investment  grade  corporate  debt  securities  and  government  and
agency securities. The corporate debt and government and agency securities that we invest in are generally deemed to be low risk based on their
credit ratings from the major rating agencies.

The  longer  the  duration  of  these  securities,  the  more  susceptible  they  are  to  changes  in  market  interest  rates  and  bond  yields.  As  interest
rates  increase,  those  securities  purchased  at  a  lower  yield  show  a  mark-to-market  unrealized  loss.  The  unrealized  losses  are  due  primarily  to
changes in credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitative
and quantitative criteria. We presently do not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position and expect to realize the full value of
all these investments upon maturity or sale.

Investment  securities  in  a  continuous  loss  position  for  greater  than  12  months  had  an  estimated  fair  value  $360  million  and  an  immaterial
amount of unrealized losses as of December 31, 2017 and an estimated fair value of $123 million and an immaterial amount of unrealized losses as
of December 31, 2016 . As of December 31, 2017 , these securities had a weighted average remaining duration of approximately 12 months. Refer
to “Note 17 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” for amounts reclassified to earnings from unrealized gains and losses.

In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2016,  we  sold  our  equity  holdings  of  MercadoLibre,  Inc.,  which  was  included  in  our  short-term  marketable  equity
instruments for net proceeds of $1.3 billion . The pre-tax gain of $1.3 billion was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into
interest and other, net on our consolidated statement of income.

Our equity and cost method investments are reported in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017

and 2016 , our equity and cost method investments totaled $885 million and $118 million , respectively.

In 2017, we made a cost method investment of $50 million . In addition, we received a 5.44% ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for
our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment,  resulting in a cost method investment  of $725 million . The gain on disposal of our
eBay India business of $167 million was recorded in interest and other, net on our consolidated statement of income.

In  2017,  we  recorded  a  $61  million  impairment  charge  to  write-down  our  cost  method  investment  in  Jasper  Infotech  Private  Limited
(“Snapdeal”).  The investment was measured at fair value due to events and circumstances that we identified as having significant impact on its fair
value.  The  fair  value  measurement  of  the  impaired  investment  was  measured  using  significant  unobservable  inputs.  The  impairment  charge,
representing the difference between the net book value and the fair value, was recorded to interest and other, net. In 2016, we sold a portion of our
equity interest in Snapdeal. The resulting gain was recorded in interest and other, net on our consolidated statement of income.

Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). Level 1
instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 instrument
valuations are obtained from  readily  available pricing sources  for comparable instruments,  identical instruments  in less active markets,  or models
using market observable inputs. The majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms
as well as multiple inputs where applicable, such as equity prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility and currency rates. We did not have any
transfers of financial instruments between valuation levels during 2017 or 2016 .

Other  financial  instruments,  including  accounts  receivable  and  accounts  payable  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  their  fair  value

because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

Note 9 – Derivative Instruments

Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate and
interest rate movements. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.

We  use  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  cash  flows  related  to  forecasted  revenues,  expenses,  assets  and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are generally one month to one year in duration, but with maturities up to 18 months.
The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by
changes  in  the  applicable  U.S.  dollar/foreign  currency  exchange  rate.  We  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  our  foreign  exchange  contracts  on  a
quarterly basis.

We use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2024.
These interest rate swaps had the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with $2.4 billion of these notes so that the
interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. The duration
of these interest rate contracts matches the duration of the fixed rate notes due 2019, 2021 and 2024.

Cash Flow Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted
transaction  affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  these  contracts,  if  any,  is  recorded  immediately  in
earnings.  Derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  must  be  de-designated  as  hedges  when  it  is  probable  the  forecasted  hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI
associated  with  such  derivative  instruments  are  immediately  reclassified  into  earnings  .  As  of  December  31,  2017  ,  we  have  estimated  that
approximately  $53  million  of  net  derivative  loss  related  to  our  cash  flow  hedges  included  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  will  be
reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.

The amounts recognized in earnings related to the ineffective portion of our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not
material in 2017 and 2016. We did not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness.

Fair Value Hedges

We have designated  the interest  rate  swaps used to  manage  interest  rate  risk  on our fixed  rate  notes  issued in July 2014 and maturing  in
2019, 2021 and 2024 as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges. These transactions are designated as fair
value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair value of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due
to benchmark interest rate movements. Changes in the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized in other assets or other
liabilities  with  a  corresponding  increase  or  decrease  in  long-term  debt.  Each  quarter  we  pay  interest  based  on  LIBOR  plus  a  spread  to  the
counterparty  and  on  a  semi-annual  basis  receive  interest  from  the  counterparty  per  the  fixed  rate  of  these  senior  notes.  The  net  amount  is
recognized as interest expense in interest and other, net.

Non-Designated Hedges

Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary
assets  or  liabilities,  including  intercompany  balances  denominated  in  non-functional  currencies.  The  gains  and  losses  on  our  derivatives  not
designated as hedging instruments are recorded in interest and other , net, partially offset by the foreign currency gains and losses on the related
assets and liabilities that are also recorded in interest and other, net.

Under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our derivative contracts, subject to applicable requirements, we are
allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. However, we have elected to present
the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017 , the potential effect of
rights  of  set-off  associated  with  the  foreign  exchange  contracts  would  be  an  offset  to  both  assets  and  liabilities  by  $21  million  ,  resulting  in  net
derivative assets of $5 million and net derivative liabilities of $8 million .

Notional Amounts of Derivative Contracts

Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only as
the  basis  on  which  the  value  of  foreign  exchange  payments  under  these  contracts  are  determined.  The  following  table  provides  the  notional

Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to
mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss
with  any  one  counterparty  resulting  from  this  type  of  credit  risk  is  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis.  To  further  limit  credit  risk,  we  also  enter  into
collateral security arrangements related to certain interest rate derivative instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if the fair
value of the derivative instrument exceeds certain thresholds. Additional collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit downgrade
by either party. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, collateral related to our foreign exchange derivative transactions. As of
December 31, 2017 , we had neither pledged nor received collateral related to our interest rate derivative transactions.

Senior Notes

In 2017, we issued senior unsecured notes, or senior notes, in an aggregate principal amount of  $2.5 billion . The issuance consisted of $400
million  of floating rate notes due 2023,  $500 million  of  2.150%  fixed rate notes due 2020, $750 million  of  2.750%  fixed rate notes due 2023 and
$850 million  of   3.600%  fixed rate notes due 2027. In addition,  $1.0 billion of 1.350% fixed rate notes due 2017 and $450 million of floating rate
notes due 2017 matured and were repaid in 2017.

In 2016, we issued senior unsecured notes, or senior notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $2.3 billion . The issuance consisted of  $750
million  aggregate principal amount of   2.500%  fixed rate notes due 2018,   $750 million  aggregate principal amount of   3.800%  fixed rate notes
due 2022 and  $750 million  aggregate principal amount of  6.000%  fixed rate notes due 2056.

F-28

None of the floating rate notes are redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed
rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time
to time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.500% fixed rate notes due 2018, the 2.150% fixed rate notes due 2020, the
3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022, the floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027 or
the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The  indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  to
exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions
with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default.

To help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we entered
into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on LIBOR plus a spread.
These  swaps  were  designated  as  fair  value  hedges  against  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  certain  fixed  rate  senior  notes  resulting  from  changes  in
interest rates. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the
hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in market interest rates.

The effective interest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of
any  original  issue  discount  on  these  senior  notes.  Interest  on  these  senior  notes  is  payable  either  quarterly  or  semiannually.  Interest  expense
associated with these senior notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs, during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was
approximately $307 million , $254 million and $178 million , respectively.  As of December  31,  2017  and 2016 ,  the  estimated  fair  value  of  these
senior notes, using Level 2 inputs, was approximately $10.1 billion and $8.9 billion , respectively.

Commercial Paper

We have an up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397
days  from  the  date  of  issue  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  at  maturity  of  up  to  $1.5  billion  outstanding  at  any  time  outstanding.  As  of
December 31, 2017 , there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.

Credit Agreement

In November 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured  $2 billion five -year revolving credit facility. We may
also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount
of $1  billion  .  Funds  borrowed  under  the  credit  agreement  may  be  used  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  acquisitions  and  other  general
corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2017 , no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have an
up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order
to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result,
$500 million of borrowing capacity was available as of December 31, 2017 for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.

Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875
percent to 1.5 percent  or (ii) a formula  based on the agent bank’s prime rate,  the federal  funds effective  rate plus  0.5 percent or LIBOR plus 1.0
percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.5 percent. The credit agreement will terminate and all
amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request
or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date
is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The credit

F-29

agreement includes customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and
indemnification  provisions  in  favor  of  the  banks.  The  negative  covenants  include  restrictions  regarding  the  incurrence  of  liens  and  subsidiary
indebtedness,  in  each  case,  subject  to  certain  exceptions.  The  financial  covenants  require  us  to  meet  a  quarterly  financial  test  with  respect  to  a
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The events of default include the occurrence of a change
of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect to us.

We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2017 .

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We  have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cash
withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“Aggregate
Cash Deposits”). This arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net
balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense
or  income  under  the  arrangement.  As  of  December  31,  2017  ,  we  had  a  total  of  $1.9  billion  in  cash  withdrawals  offsetting  our  $2.1  billion  in
Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.

Litigation and Other Legal Matters

Overview

We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an
indeterminate amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the
estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in
our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the
low  end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  an
estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range arising
directly  from  the  proceeding  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  or  settlement)  are  not  material.  If  we  cannot  estimate  the
probable  or  reasonably  possible  loss  or  range  of  losses  arising  from  a  proceeding,  we  have  disclosed  that  fact.  In  assessing  the  materiality  of  a
proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies
sought  by  plaintiffs  (e.g.,  injunctive  relief)  that  may  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a  manner  that  could  have  a  material  adverse
impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 12, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that
could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.

Amounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2017 . Except as otherwise  noted for the proceedings described in this Note 12, we have concluded, based on currently  available
information,  that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  or
settlement)  in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and
subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s
expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial condition for that reporting period could be material.

General Matters

Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.
We are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects
of our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity. Such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against
our companies and/or against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject
to increased exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We
have  in  the  past  been  forced  to  litigate  such  claims.  We  may  also  become  more  vulnerable  to  third-party  claims  as  laws  such  as  the  Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our
business  (both  in  terms  of  the  range  of  products  and  services  that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  become  subject  to  laws  in
jurisdictions  where  the  underlying  laws  with  respect  to  the  potential  liability  of  online  intermediaries  like  ourselves  are  either  unclear  or  less
favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectual
property claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods
of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms.

From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our
users (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,
rules, policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable

law  or  that  we  have  acted  unfairly  and/or  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  prices,  rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  and
significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  are  increasing  as  the  political  and  regulatory  landscape  changes  and,  as  we  have  grown  larger,  our
businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographical operations) and our
products  and  services  have  increased  in  complexity.  Any  claims  or  regulatory  actions  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  time
consuming,  result  in  costly  litigation,  damage  awards  (including  statutory  damages  for  certain  causes  of  action  in  certain  jurisdictions),  injunctive
relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our business practices in expensive ways,
require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business.

Indemnification Provisions

We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship
of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us
and  PayPal,  which  may  be  significant.  In  addition,  the  indemnity  rights  we  have  against  PayPal  under  the  agreements  may  not  be  sufficient  to
protect us and our indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These
agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become
subject as a result of their affiliation with us.

In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we
have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these
contracts,  we generally  indemnify,  hold harmless  and agree  to  reimburse  the  indemnified  party  for  losses  suffered  or incurred  by the indemnified
party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that
such  marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  for
intellectual  property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  our
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded
in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  in  connection  with  our  indemnification  provisions  have  not  been  significant,  either  individually  or
collectively.

Note 13 – Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

We are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series; to establish the number
of  shares  included  within  each  series;  to  fix  the  rights,  preferences  and  privileges  of  the  shares  of  each  wholly  unissued  series  and  any  related
qualifications, limitations or restrictions; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series (but not below the number of shares of a
series then outstanding) without any further vote or action by our stockholders. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , there were 10 million shares of
$0.001  par value preferred stock authorized for issuance, and no shares issued or outstanding.

Common Stock

Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 3.6 billion shares of common stock.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,
subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any
share  repurchases  under  our  stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  made  through  open  market  transactions,  block  trades,  privately  negotiated
transactions  (including  accelerated  share  repurchase  transactions)  or  other  means  at  times  and  in  such  amounts  as  management  deems
appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated
at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and
regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

In July 2016, our Board authorized a $2.5 billion stock repurchase program and in July 2017 our Board authorized an additional $3.0 billion
stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization. The stock repurchase activity under
our stock repurchase programs during 2017 was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Note 14 – Employee Benefit Plans

Equity Incentive Plans

We  have  equity  incentive  plans under  which  we  grant  equity  awards,  including  stock  options,  restricted  stock  units  (“RSUs”),  performance-
based  restricted  stock  units  (“PBRSUs”),  stock  payment  awards  and  performance  share  units,  to  our  directors,  officers  and  employees.  As  of
December 31, 2017 , 755 million shares were authorized under our equity incentive plans and 76 million shares were available for future grant.

Stock options granted under these plans generally vest 12.5% six months from the date of grant (or 25% one year from the date of grant for
grants to new employees) with the remainder vesting at a rate of 2.08%  per month thereafter, and generally expire  seven to ten  years from the
date of grant. RSU awards granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans generally vest in annual or quarterly installments over a
period of three to five years, are subject to the employees’ continuing service to us and do not have an expiration date.

In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,  certain  executives  were  eligible  to  receive  PBRSU.  PBRSU  awards  are  subject  to  performance  and  time-based
vesting  requirements.  The  target  number  of  shares  subject  to  the  PBRSU  award  are  adjusted  based  on  our  business  performance  measured
against the performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the performance period. Generally, if the performance
criteria is satisfied, one-half of the award vests in March following the end of the performance period and the other half of the award vests in March
of the following year.

Deferred Stock Units

Prior  to  December  31,  2016,  we  granted  deferred  stock  units  to  each  non-employee  director  (other  than  Mr.  Omidyar)  at  the  time  of  our
annual meeting of stockholders and to new non-employee directors upon their election to the Board. Each deferred stock unit award granted to a
new non-employee director upon election to the Board vests 25% one year from the date of grant, and at a rate of 2.08%  per month thereafter. In
addition, directors were permitted to elect to receive, in lieu of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time these fees would otherwise
be payable, fully vested deferred stock units with an initial value equal to the amount based on the fair market value of common stock at the date of
grant. Following termination of a non-employee director’s service on the Board of Directors, deferred stock units granted prior to August 1, 2013 are
payable  in  stock  or  cash  (at  our  election),  while  deferred  stock  units  granted  on  or  after  August  1,  2013  are  payable  solely  in  stock.  As  of
December  31,  2017  ,  there  were  approximately  259,632 deferred  stock  units  outstanding,  which  are  included  in  our  restricted  stock  unit  activity
below. As of December 31, 2016, we no longer grant deferred stock units.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We  have  an  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (“ESPP”)  for  all  eligible  employees.  Under  the  plan,  shares  of  our  common  stock  may  be
purchased  over  an  offering  period  with  a  maximum  duration  of  two  years  at  85%  of  the  lower  of  the  fair  market  value  on  the  first  day  of  the
applicable offering period or on the last day of the six-month purchase period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10%
of their eligible compensation during an offering period. During 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , employees purchased approximately 4 million , 4 million and
4 million shares under this plan at average prices of $22.32 , $18.97 and $30.83 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , approximately
16 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance.

Stock Option Activity

No stock options were granted in 2017 and an immaterial amount of stock options were granted during 2016 and 2015. The weighted average

grant-date fair value of options granted during 2016 and 2015 was $5.40 and $6.84 , respectively.

During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our equity incentive plans was $26 million , $16 million
and $130 million , respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2017 , we had options to purchase 3 million shares
of our common stock outstanding and in-the-money.

As of December  31,  2017  , there  was approximately  $831 million of  unearned  stock-based  compensation  that  will  be  expensed  from  2018
through  2021.  If  there  are  any  modifications  or  cancellations  of  the  underlying  unvested  awards,  we  may  be  required  to  accelerate,  increase  or
cancel all or a portion of the remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future unearned stock-based compensation will increase to
the extent we grant additional equity awards, change the mix of grants between stock options and restricted stock units or assume unvested equity
awards in connection with acquisitions.

Modifications of Stock-Based Awards

During 2015, in connection with the Distribution, restricted and deferred stock awards and employee stock option awards were modified and
converted into new equity awards using conversion ratios designed to preserve the value of these awards to the holders immediately prior to the
Distribution.  On  July  17,  2015,  employees  holding  stock  options,  restricted  stock  awards  or  units,  deferred  stock  awards,  and  ESPP  awards
denominated  in  pre-Distribution  eBay  stock  received  a  number  of  otherwise-similar  awards  in  post-Distribution  eBay  stock  and/or  PayPal  stock
based on the conversion ratios outlined for each group of employees in the Employee Matters Agreement that we entered into in connection with the
Distribution.  Adjustments  to  our  outstanding  stock  based  compensation  awards,  including  ESPP  awards,  resulted  in  additional  compensation
expense of approximately  $68 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting life of the underlying awards.

Employee Savings Plans

We  have  a  defined  contribution  plan,  which  is  qualified  under  Section  401(k)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  Participating  employees  may
contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we contributed one dollar for each
dollar  a  participant  contributed,  with  a  maximum  contribution  of  4% of  each  employee’s  eligible  compensation,  subject  to  a  maximum  employer
contribution of $10,800 , $10,600 and $10,600 per employee for each period, respectively. Our non-U.S. employees are covered by various other
savings plans. Total expense for these plans was $57 million , $49 million and $51 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

As of December 31, 2017 , our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $15
million , $58 million and $106 million , respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will
both begin to expire in 2018. The carryforward periods on our foreign net operating loss carryforwards are as follows: $32 million do not expire, $16
million are subject to valuation allowance and begin to expire in 2019, and $58 million are not subject to valuation allowance but will begin to expire
in 2024. As of December 31, 2017 , state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $106 million . Most of the state tax
credits carry forward indefinitely.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily

to operating losses in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions that we believe are not likely to be realized.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act” or “U.S. tax reform”) was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduces
the U.S. federal income tax rate to 21% from 35% in 2018, institutes a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the
deemed  repatriation  of  unremitted  foreign  earnings  and  creates  a  new  U.S.  minimum  tax  on  earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries.  We  have  not
completed  our  accounting  for  the  effects  of  the  Act;  however,  we  have  made  a  reasonable  estimate  of  those  effects.  Accordingly,  we  have
recognized  a  provisional  income  tax  charge  of  $3.1  billion  ,  which  is  included  as  a  component  of  the  income  tax  provision  on  our  consolidated
statement of income.

Included  in  the  provisional  amount  is  $1.4  billion  for  the  income  tax  on  the  deemed  repatriation  of  unremitted  foreign  earnings.  We  have
computed  the  amount  based  on  information  available  to  us;  however,  there  is  still  uncertainty  as  to  the  application  of  the  Act,  in  particular  as  it
relates to state income taxes. Further, we have not yet completed our analysis of the components of the computation, including the amount of our
foreign earnings subject to U.S. income tax, and the portion of our foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets. We will elect to pay the
liability for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings in installments, as specified by the Act. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, $1.2 billion of
our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

The remaining provisional amount of $1.7 billion is for the deferred income tax effects of the Act on our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries, primarily

the impact of the new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially

F-37

eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

offset  by  the  reversal  of  our  existing  deferred  tax  liability  associated  with  repatriation  of  unremitted  foreign  earnings.  In  addition,  the  provisional
amount includes the remeasurement of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, foreign withholding taxes and other outside basis differences.
We have computed the amount based on information available to us, including our expectation that existing foreign basis differences will affect the
amount  of  U.S.  minimum  tax  upon  reversal;  however,  there  is  still  uncertainty  as  to  the  application  of  the  Act.  We  have  not  yet  completed  our
analysis of the components of the tax computation, including a complete reconciliation of the book and tax bases in our foreign subsidiaries. As we
complete our analysis of U.S. tax reform in 2018, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may materially impact our provision
for income taxes from continuing operations in the period in which the adjustments are made.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we began the process of realigning our legal structure, subsequent to the distribution of PayPal Holdings,
Inc., to better reflect how we manage and operate our platforms. We consider many factors in effecting this realignment, including foreign exchange
exposures, long-term cash flows and cash needs of our platforms, capital allocation considerations and the associated tax effects. As a result, we
achieved a substantial step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign eBay platforms in 2016. The step-up in tax basis of our foreign
eBay platforms resulted from our election to terminate an existing tax ruling and finalize a new agreement with the foreign tax authority. In the fourth
quarter of 2016, we recognized a tax benefit of $4.6 billion , which represented the income tax effect of this step-up in tax basis. During the first half
of 2017, we recognized a noncash income tax charge of $376 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of the associated deferred tax
asset. In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms as a result of
voluntary domiciling our Classifieds intangible assets into a new jurisdiction and recognized a tax benefit of $695 million .

As a result of the realignment, we no longer benefit from tax rulings previously concluded in several different jurisdictions. Without the benefit
of  the  rulings,  the  noncash  tax  impacts  of  the  realignment  in  our  foreign  eBay  and  Classifieds  platforms  have  increased  our  income  tax  rate  in
certain  foreign  jurisdictions,  most  significantly  Switzerland.  The  higher  rate  results  from  eBay  being  subject  to  a  higher  enacted  tax  rate  for  the
foreseeable future.

While we experienced a higher tax rate, the realignment allows us to achieve certain foreign cash tax benefits due to the step-up in tax basis
achieved in certain foreign jurisdictions. We expect these cash tax benefits to remain consistent, subject to the performance of our foreign platforms
, for a period in excess of 10 years. The realignment is expected to extend into 2018 and primarily impact our international entities. However, U.S.
tax reform and the new U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings will reduce our expected consolidated cash tax benefits.

The following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the beginning of the period

Increases related to prior period tax positions

Included within our gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits of $487 million as of December 31, 2017 is $100 million of unrecognized tax
benefits indemnified by PayPal. If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit
of $420 million .  Of  this  amount,  approximately  $95 million of  unrecognized  tax  benefit  is  indemnified  by  PayPal  and  a  corresponding  receivable
would be reduced upon a future realization. As of December 31, 2017 , our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were included in other liabilities
on our consolidated balance sheet.

We  recognize  interest  and/or  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  income  tax  expense.  In  2017 , $3  million  was  included  in  tax
expense for interest and penalties. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $43 million
and $54 million , respectively.

We  are  subject  to  both  direct  and  indirect  taxation  in  the  U.S.  and  various  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  are  under  examination  by
certain  tax  authorities  for  the  2008  to  2013  tax  years.  We  believe  that  adequate  amounts  have  been  reserved  for  any  adjustments  that  may
ultimately result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for tax
years after 2007 include, among others, the U.S. (Federal and California), Germany, Korea, Israel, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Canada.

Although  the  timing  of  the  resolution  and/or  closure  of  audits  is  highly  uncertain,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  balance  of  gross
unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to examination
and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized
tax benefits.

On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner , the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion invalidating the regulations relating to the treatment
of  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  an  intercompany  cost-sharing  arrangement.  A  final  decision  was  issued  by  the  Tax  Court  in  December
2015. The IRS is appealing the decision and filed its arguments opposing the Tax Court decision in June 2016. Due to the uncertainty surrounding
