ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

Our vision

Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy
is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world.

The mobile-first, cloud-first world is transforming the way individuals and organizations use and interact with technology. Our worldview for mobile-
first is not about the mobility of devices; it is centered on the mobility of experiences that, in turn, are orchestrated by the cloud. Cloud computing
and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. Mobility
encompasses  the  rich  collection  of  data,  applications,  and  services  that  accompany  our  customers  as  they  move  from  setting  to  setting  in  their
lives. We are transforming our businesses to enable Microsoft to lead the direction of this transformation, and enable our customers and partners
to thrive in this evolving world.

What we offer

Founded in 1975, we operate worldwide and have offices in more than 100 countries. We develop, license, and support a wide range of software
products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives. We offer an array of
services, including cloud-based services, to consumers and businesses. We design, manufacture, and sell devices that integrate with our cloud-
based services, and we deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience.

Our products include operating systems for computing devices, servers, phones, and other intelligent devices; server applications for distributed
computing  environments;  cross-device  productivity  applications;  business  solution  applications;  desktop  and  server  management  tools;  software
development  tools;  video  games;  and  online  advertising.  We  also  design  and  sell  hardware  including  PCs,  tablets,  gaming  and  entertainment
consoles,  phones,  other  intelligent  devices,  and  related  accessories.  We  offer  cloud-based  solutions  that  provide  customers  with  software,
services, platforms, and content. We also provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system
integrators and developers.

The ambitions that drive us

To carry out our strategy, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:

PART I
Item 1

•

•

•

  Reinvent productivity and business processes.

  Build the intelligent cloud platform.

  Create more personal computing.

Reinvent productivity and business processes

We  believe  we  can  significantly  enhance  the  lives  of  our  customers  using  our  broad  portfolio  of  communication,  productivity,  and  information
services  that  spans  devices  and  platforms.  Productivity  will  be  the  first  and  foremost  objective,  to  enable  people  to  meet  and  collaborate  more
easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We will design applications as dual-use with the intelligence to partition data between work
and  life  while  respecting  each  person’s  privacy  choices.  The  foundation  for  these  efforts  will  rest  on  advancing  our  leading  productivity,
collaboration,  and  business  process  tools  including  Skype,  OneDrive,  OneNote,  Outlook,  Word,  Excel,  PowerPoint,  Bing,  and  Dynamics.  With
Office 365, we provide these familiar industry-leading productivity and business process tools as cloud services, enabling access from anywhere
and any device. This creates an opportunity to reach new customers, and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers.

We see opportunity in combining our offerings in new ways that are more contextual and personal, while ensuring people, rather than their devices,
remain at the center of the digital experience. We will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own. As people move from
device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. We are engineering our applications so users can find, try, and buy them in
friction-free ways.

Build the intelligent cloud platform

In deploying technology that advances business strategy, enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative,
and satisfied, and connect with customers in new and compelling ways. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. To achieve
these objectives, increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest
opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength.

The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower
cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns,
improving  the  utilization  of  computing,  storage,  and  network  resources;  and  multi-tenancy  lowers  application  maintenance  labor  costs  for  large
public clouds. As one of the largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we are well-positioned to help businesses move to the cloud so that
businesses can focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers like Microsoft.

With Azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe
the combination of Azure and Windows Server makes us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern
business.  We  are  working  to  enhance  the  return  on  information  technology  (“IT”)  investment  by  enabling  enterprises  to  combine  their  existing
datacenters  and  our  public  cloud  into  a  single  cohesive  infrastructure.  Businesses  can  deploy  applications  in  their  own  datacenter,  a  partner’s
datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they
want.

We enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications (both our own and third-party) and integrate them with their existing
security  and  management  infrastructure.  We  will  continue  to  innovate  with  higher-level  services  including  identity  and  directory  services  that
manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices, rich
data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web and mobile backend services, and developer

Item 1

productivity services. To foster a rich developer ecosystem, our digital work and life experiences will also be extensible, enabling customers and
partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. This strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters
and other infrastructure to support our devices and services.

Create more personal computing

Windows 10 is the cornerstone of our ambition to usher in an era of more personal computing. We see the launch of Windows 10 in July 2015 as a
critical, transformative moment for the Company because we will move from an operating system that runs on a PC to a service that can power the
full spectrum of devices in our customers’ lives. We developed Windows 10 not only to be familiar to our users, but more safe and secure, and
always  up-to-date.  We  believe  Windows  10  is  more  personal  and  productive,  working  seamlessly  with  functionality  such  as  Cortana,  Office,
Continuum,  and  universal  applications.  We  designed  Windows  10  to  foster  innovation  –  from  us,  our  partners  and  developers  –  through
experiences such as our new browser Microsoft Edge, across the range of existing devices, and into entirely new device categories.

Our  ambition  for  Windows  10  is  to  broaden  our  economic  opportunity  through  three  key  levers:  an  original  equipment  manufacturer  (“OEM”)
ecosystem  that  creates  exciting  new  hardware  designs  for  Windows  10;  our  own  commitment  to  the  health  and  profitability  of  our  first-party
premium device portfolio; and monetization opportunities such as services, subscriptions, gaming, and search. Our OEM partners are investing in
an extensive portfolio of hardware designs and configurations as they ready for Windows 10. By December 2015, we anticipate the widest range of
Windows hardware ever to be available.

With the launch of Windows 10, we are realizing our vision of a single, unified Windows operating system on which developers and OEMs can
contribute to a thriving Windows ecosystem. We invest heavily to make Windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for
the needs of a modern workforce. We are working to create a broad developer opportunity by unifying the installed base to Windows 10 through
upgrades  and  ongoing  updates,  and  by  enabling  universal  Windows  applications  to  run  across  all  device  targets.  As  part  of  our  strategic
objectives, we are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new categories, and stimulate demand
in the Windows ecosystem, including across PCs, phones, tablets, consoles, wearables, large multi-touch displays, and new categories such as
the  HoloLens  holographic  computing  platform.  We  are  developing  new  input/output  methods  like  speech,  pen,  gesture,  and  augmented  reality
holograms to power more personal computing experiences with Windows 10.

Our future opportunity

There are several distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long-term, which
we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:

•

•

•

•

•

  Delivering new productivity, entertainment, and business processes to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play,

and interact with one another.

  Establishing the Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, other devices, and the cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of

developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market.

  Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.

  Developing  new  devices  that  have  increasingly  natural  ways  to  interact  with  them,  including  speech,  pen,  gesture,  and  augmented

reality holograms.

  Applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command.

We  believe  the  breadth  of  our  products  and  services  portfolio,  our  large  global  partner  and  customer  base,  our  growing  ecosystem,  and  our
ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas and differentiate ourselves from competitors.

Item 1

OPERATING SEGMENTS

We  operate  our  business  in  six  segments.  Our  Devices  and  Consumer  (“D&C”)  segments  include  D&C  Licensing,  Computing  and  Gaming
Hardware,  Phone  Hardware,  and  D&C  Other.  Our  Commercial  segments  include  Commercial  Licensing  and  Commercial  Other.  Our  segments
provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives
across  the  development,  sales,  marketing,  and  services  organizations,  and  they  provide  a  framework  for  timely  and  rational  allocation  of
development, sales, marketing, and services resources within businesses. In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure as
part  of  our  transformation  in  the  mobile-first,  cloud-first  world.  As  we  evolve  how  we  allocate  resources  and  analyze  performance  in  the  new
structure, it is possible that our segments may change.

On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services Business (“NDS”). We report the financial
performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint
strategic  initiatives  with  Nokia  were  reflected  in  our  D&C  Licensing  segment.  The  contractual  relationship  with  Nokia  related  to  those  initiatives
ended in conjunction with the acquisition.

Additional  information  on  our  operating  segments  and  geographic  and  product  information  is  contained  in  Note  22  –  Segment  Information  and
Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Devices and Consumer

Our  D&C  segments  develop,  manufacture,  market,  and  support  products  and  services  designed  to  entertain  and  connect  people,  increase
personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C
segments are made up of D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other.

D&C Licensing

The  principal  products  and  services  provided  by  the  D&C  Licensing  segment  are:  Windows,  including  all  OEM  licensing  (“Windows  OEM”)  and
other  non-volume  licensing  and  academic  volume  licensing  of  the  Windows  operating  system  and  related  software;  non-volume  licensing  of
Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”); Windows Phone operating system, including related
patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue.

The  Windows  operating  system  is  designed  to  deliver  a  more  personal  computing  experience  for  users  by  enabling  consistency  of  experience,
applications, and information across their devices.

Windows revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the
devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is impacted by:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

  The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.

  Differences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets.

  Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.

  Customer mix between consumer, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises.

  Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.

  Pricing  changes  and  promotions,  pricing  variation  that  occurs  when  the  mix  of  devices  manufactured  shifts  from  local  and  regional

system builders to large, multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.

  Piracy.

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 1

The  versions  of  Office  included  in  our  D&C  Licensing  segment  are  designed  to  increase  personal  productivity  through  a  range  of  programs,
services,  and  software  solutions.  Growth  depends  on  our  ability  to  add  value  to  the  core  product  set  and  to  continue  to  expand  our  product
offerings  in  other  areas  such  as  content  management  and  collaboration.  Office  Consumer  revenue  is  impacted  by  sales  to  customers  that  buy
Office with their new devices and by product launches, as well as the transition to Office 365 Consumer, our subscription-based cloud service that
provides access to Office plus other productivity services. Office 365 Consumer revenue is included in our D&C Other segment.

The Windows Phone operating system is designed to bring users closer to the people, applications, and content they need. As noted above, prior
to our acquisition of NDS, Microsoft and Nokia jointly created new mobile products and services and extended established products and services
to new markets through a strategic alliance. Windows Phone revenue associated with this contractual relationship was reflected in D&C Licensing.
Windows Phone revenue also includes revenue from licensing mobile-related patents.

Competition

The Windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple
and  Google.  We  believe  Windows  competes  effectively  by  giving  customers  choice,  value,  flexibility,  security,  an  easy-to-use  interface,
compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity, and the largest support network for
any operating system.

Competitors  to  the  versions  of  Office  included  in  D&C  Licensing  include  global  application  vendors  such  as  Apple  and  Google,  numerous  web-
based  and  mobile  application  competitors,  and  local  application  developers  in  Asia  and  Europe.  Apple  distributes  versions  of  its  pre-installed
application  software,  such  as  email,  note-taking,  and  calendar  products,  through  its  PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Google  provides  a  hosted
messaging and productivity suite. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications can also position themselves as alternatives to our
products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of providing powerful, flexible, secure, and easy to use solutions that
work across a variety of devices.

Windows Phone operating system faces competition from iOS, Android, and Blackberry operating systems. Windows Phone competes based on
differentiated user interface, personalized applications, compatibility with Windows PCs and tablets, and other unique capabilities.

Computing and Gaming Hardware

The  principal  products  and  services  provided  by  the  Computing  and  Gaming  Hardware  segment  are:  Xbox  gaming  and  entertainment  consoles
and  accessories,  second-party  and  third-party  video  game  royalties,  and  Xbox  Live  subscriptions  (“Xbox  Platform”);  Surface  devices  and
accessories (“Surface”); and Microsoft PC accessories.

The  Xbox  Platform  is  designed  to  provide  a  unique  variety  of  entertainment  choices  through  the  use  of  our  devices,  peripherals,  content,  and
online services. We released Xbox 360 and Xbox One in November 2005 and November 2013, respectively.

Surface  is  designed  to  help  organizations,  students,  and  consumers  to  be  more  productive.  Our  latest  Surface  devices,  the  Surface  Pro  3  and
Surface 3, were released in June 2014 and May 2015, respectively.

Competition

Our  Xbox  Platform  competes  with  console  platforms  from  Sony  and  Nintendo,  both  of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  The
lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released their latest generation console in November 2012.
Sony released their latest generation console in November 2013.

7

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 1

We believe the success of gaming and entertainment consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console, providing exclusive game
content  that  gamers  seek,  the  computational  power  and  reliability  of  the  console,  and  the  ability  to  create  new  experiences  via  online  services,
downloadable  content,  and  peripherals.  In  addition  to  Sony  and  Nintendo,  we  compete  with  other  providers  of  entertainment  services  through
online  marketplaces.  We  believe  the  Xbox  Platform  is  effectively  positioned  against  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant
innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user  interface,  developer  tools,  online  gaming  and  entertainment  services,  and  continued  strong  exclusive
content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.

Surface devices face competition from Apple, as well as other computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers, many of which are also current or
potential partners and customers.

Phone Hardware

The principal products provided by the Phone Hardware segment are Lumia phones and other non-Lumia phones, which we began manufacturing
and selling with the acquisition of NDS on April 25, 2014. Our Lumia phones run Windows and are designed to enable people and organizations to
connect to the people and content that matter most, using integrated Microsoft services such as Outlook, OneDrive, Skype, and Office.

Competition

Our phones face competition primarily from Apple, Samsung, and many other mobile device manufacturers running the Android operating system,
and offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative imaging technologies across various price points.

D&C Other

The principal products and services provided by the D&C Other segment are: Resale, consisting of transactions in our Windows Store and Xbox
marketplace;  search  advertising;  display  advertising;  Office  365  Consumer,  comprising  Office  365  Home  and  Office  365  Personal;  Studios,
comprising first-party video games; Mojang; and non-Microsoft products sold in our retail stores.

Our online application marketplaces are designed to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base
and benefit users by providing centralized access to certified applications. Xbox Live transactions consist of online entertainment content, such as
games, music, movies, and TV shows, accessible on Xbox consoles and other devices.

Search and display advertising includes Bing, Bing Ads, MSN, and Xbox ads. We have a partnership with Yahoo! in which we provide algorithmic
and  paid  search  platform  for  Yahoo!  websites  worldwide.  In  June  2015,  we  entered  into  agreements  with  AOL  and  AppNexus  to  outsource  our
display sales efforts.

Office  365  Consumer  is  designed  to  increase  personal  productivity  through  a  range  of  Microsoft  Office  programs  and  services  delivered  across
multiple platforms via the cloud.

Studios designs and markets games for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and online. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users
and increase engagement by developing a deep library of content that consumers seek.

We  acquired  Mojang  Synergies  AB  (“Mojang”),  the  Swedish  video  game  developer  of  the  Minecraft  gaming  franchise,  in  November  2014.  The
addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own.

Competition

We  face  competition  for  our  Resale  products  and  services  from  various  online  marketplaces,  including  those  operated  by  Amazon,  Apple,  and
Google.

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 1

Our search and display advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals like
Yahoo!  that  provide  content  and  online  offerings  to  end  users.  Our  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  new  users,  understand  intent,  and
match  intent  with  relevant  content  and  advertiser  offerings.  We  believe  we  can  attract  new  users  by  continuing  to  offer  new  and  compelling
products and services.

Competitors to Office 365 Consumer are the same as those discussed above for Office Consumer.

Competitors to Studios and Mojang are the same as those discussed above for our Xbox gaming and entertainment business, as well as game
studios like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.

Commercial

Our  Commercial  segments  develop,  market,  and  support  software  and  services  designed  to  increase  individual,  team,  and  organizational
productivity  and  efficiency,  including  simplifying  everyday  tasks  through  seamless  operations  across  the  user’s  hardware  and  software.
Commercial is made up of the Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other segments.

Commercial Licensing

The  principal  products  and  services  provided  by  the  Commercial  Licensing  segment  are:  server  products,  including  Windows  Server,  Microsoft
SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); Microsoft Office for business, including Office, Exchange,
SharePoint, Skype for Business, and related CALs (“Office Commercial”); volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic
(“Windows Commercial”); Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online; Windows Embedded; and Skype.

Our server products are designed to make information technology professionals and developers and their systems more productive and efficient.
Server  software  is  integrated  server  infrastructure  and  middleware  designed  to  support  software  applications  built  on  the  Windows  Server
operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-
oriented  architecture  platform,  security,  and  identity  software.  We  also  license  standalone  and  software  development  lifecycle  tools  for  software
architects,  developers,  testers,  and  project  managers.  Revenue  comes  from  purchases  through  volume  licensing  programs,  licenses  sold  to
OEMs,  and  retail  packaged  product.  CALs  provide  access  rights  to  certain  server  products,  including  Windows  Server  and  SQL  Server.  CAL
revenue is reported along with the associated server product.

The  versions  of  Office  in  Commercial  Licensing  are  designed  to  increase  personal,  team,  and  organizational  productivity  through  a  range  of
programs,  services,  and  software  solutions.  Office  Commercial  revenue  is  mainly  affected  by  a  combination  of  the  demand  from  commercial
customers  for  volume  licensing  and  software  assurance  and  the  number  of  information  workers  in  a  licensed  enterprise.  Office  Commercial
revenue growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other areas such as
content management, enterprise search, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. CALs provide access rights to certain
Office  Commercial  products,  including  Exchange,  SharePoint,  and  Skype  for  Business,  formerly  Lync.  CAL  revenue  is  reported  along  with  the
associated Office product.

Windows Commercial includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic. Windows Commercial revenue is affected
mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and software assurance, often reflecting the number of information workers
in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.

Microsoft  Dynamics  products  provide  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  customer  relationship  management,  supply  chain
management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is
largely driven by the number of information workers licensed.

Windows  Embedded  extends  the  power  of  Windows  and  the  cloud  to  intelligent  systems,  including  the  Internet  of  Things  (“IoT”),  by  delivering
specialized operating systems, tools, and services.

Skype is designed to connect friends, family, clients, and colleagues through a variety of devices. Revenue is largely driven by the sale of minutes,
subscriptions, and advertising.

Competition

Our  server  products  face  competition  from  a  wide  variety  of  server  operating  systems  and  applications  offered  by  companies  with  a  range  of
market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix
operating  system  preinstalled  on  server  hardware.  Nearly  all  computer  manufacturers  offer  server  hardware  for  the  Linux  operating  system  and
many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible
applications  now  produced  by  many  commercial  and  non-commercial  software  developers.  A  number  of  companies,  such  as  Red  Hat,  supply
versions of Linux.

We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions
and  middleware  technology  platforms,  software  applications  for  connectivity  (both  Internet  and  intranet),  security,  hosting,  database,  and  e-
business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-
wide  computing  solutions.  Commercial  competitors  for  our  server  applications  for  PC-based  distributed  client/server  environments  include  CA
Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and
PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java middleware vendors.

Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from
IBM,  Oracle,  SAP,  and  other  companies.  Our  products  for  software  developers  compete  against  offerings  from  Adobe,  IBM,  Oracle,  other
companies, and open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails, among
others.

We  believe  our  server  products  provide  customers  with  advantages  in  performance,  total  costs  of  ownership,  and  productivity  by  delivering
superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.

Competitors  to  Office  Commercial  includes  software  application  vendors  such  as  Adobe  Systems,  Apple,  Cisco  Systems,  Google,  IBM,  Oracle,
SAP, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers in Asia and Europe. Cisco Systems is
using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and
productivity suite. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products. We
believe  our  products  compete  effectively  based  on  our  strategy  of  providing  powerful,  flexible,  secure,  easy  to  use  solutions  that  work  well  with
technologies our customers already have and are available on a device or via the cloud.

Competitors to Windows Commercial are the same as those discussed above for Windows in the D&C Licensing segment.

Our  Microsoft  Dynamics  products  compete  with  vendors  such  as  Oracle  and  SAP  in  the  market  for  large  organizations  and  divisions  of  global
enterprises.  In  the  market  focused  on  providing  solutions  for  small  and  mid-sized  businesses,  our  Microsoft  Dynamics  products  compete  with
vendors  such  as  Infor,  The  Sage  Group,  and  NetSuite.  Salesforce.com’s  cloud  customer  relationship  management  (“CRM”)  offerings  compete
directly with Microsoft Dynamics CRM on-premises offerings.

Skype competes with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises.

Commercial Other

The  principal  products  and  services  provided  by  the  Commercial  Other  segment  are:  Commercial  Cloud,  comprising  Office  365  Commercial,
Microsoft Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and other Microsoft Office online offerings; and Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services
and Microsoft Consulting Services.

Office  365  Commercial  is  an  online  services  offering  that  includes  Microsoft  Office,  Exchange,  SharePoint,  and  Skype  for  Business,  and  is
available across a variety of devices and platforms.

Microsoft Azure is a scalable cloud platform with computing, networking, storage, database, and management, along with advanced services such
as analytics, and comprehensive solutions such as Enterprise Mobility Suite. Microsoft Azure also includes a flexible platform that helps developers
build, deploy, and manage enterprise, mobile, web, and IoT applications, for any platform or device without having to worry about the underlying
infrastructure.  Microsoft  Azure  enables  customers  to  devote  more  resources  to  development  and  use  of  applications  that  benefit  their
organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software.

Dynamics CRM Online is designed to provide customer relationship management and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses,
large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers licensed.

Enterprise  Services,  including  Premier  Support  Services  and  Microsoft  Consulting  Services,  assist  customers  in  developing,  deploying,  and
managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and information technology professionals on
various Microsoft products.

Competition

Competitors to Office 365 Commercial are the same as those discussed above for Office Commercial.

Microsoft  Azure  faces  diverse  competition  from  companies  such  as  Amazon,  Google,  IBM,  Oracle,  Salesforce.com,  VMware,  and  open  source
offerings. Azure competes by enabling deployment of existing data centers with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and runs at a
scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities.

Dynamics CRM Online primarily competes with Salesforce.com’s on-demand CRM offerings.

The Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development,
and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.

OPERATIONS

We have operations centers that support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections,
information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African
region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort
Lauderdale,  Florida,  Puerto  Rico,  Redmond,  Washington,  and  Reno,  Nevada  support  Latin  America  and  North  America.  In  addition  to  the
operations centers, we also operate data centers throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe, and Asia.

To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of
our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and
translating text.

We operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones, predominantly in Vietnam.

Our  Xbox  consoles,  Surface,  first-party  video  games,  Microsoft  PC  accessories,  and  other  hardware  are  primarily  manufactured  by  third-party
contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our
requirements.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

During  fiscal  years  2015,  2014,  and  2013,  research  and  development  expense  was  $12.0  billion,  $11.4  billion,  and  $10.4  billion,  respectively.
These  amounts  represented  13%  of  revenue  in  each  of  those  years.  We  plan  to  continue  to  make  significant  investments  in  a  broad  range  of
research and development efforts.

Product and Service Development and Intellectual Property

We develop most of our products and services internally through three engineering groups.

•

•

•

  Applications  and  Services  Engineering  Group,  focuses  on  broad  applications  and  services  core  technologies  in  productivity,

communication, education, search, and other information categories.

  Cloud  and  Enterprise  Engineering  Group,  focuses  on  development  of  our  cloud  infrastructure,  server,  database,  CRM,  enterprise

resource planning, management, development tools, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.

  Windows and Devices Engineering Group, focuses on our Windows platform across devices of all types, hardware development of our
devices,  including  Xbox  consoles,  Surface  devices,  Lumia  phones,  non-Lumia  phones,  Surface  Hub,  Microsoft  Band,  and  other
hardware products and accessories, and associated online marketplaces.

Internal  development  allows  us  to  maintain  competitive  advantages  that  come  from  product  differentiation  and  closer  technical  control  over  our
products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be
implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software
design.  Before  releasing  new  software  platforms,  we  provide  application  vendors  with  a  range  of  resources  and  guidelines  for  development,
training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally.

We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of
copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding.
We  are  a  leader  among  technology  companies  in  pursuing  patents  and  currently  have  a  portfolio  of  over  57,000  U.S.  and  international  patents
issued  and  over  35,000  pending.  While  we  employ  much  of  our  internally  developed  intellectual  property  exclusively  in  Microsoft  products  and
services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or Microsoft’s
products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents.
We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly
available  at  no  or  low  cost  to  achieve  a  strategic  objective,  such  as  promoting  industry  standards,  advancing  interoperability,  or  attracting  and
enabling our external development community.

While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe,
based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our
continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to
the development of our products.

Investing in the Future

PART I
Item 1

Microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace
disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in
a  range  of  emerging  technology  trends  and  breakthroughs  that  we  believe  offer  significant  opportunities  to  deliver  value  to  our  customers  and
growth  for  the  company.  Based  on  our  assessment  of  key  technology  trends  and  our  broad  focus  on  long-term  research  and  development,  we
maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital
work and life experiences, cloud computing, and devices operating systems and hardware.

While our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in
other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and the
United Kingdom, among others. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent
from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to
opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the business segment level. Much of our business segment
level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company.

In  addition  to  our  main  research  and  development  operations,  we  also  operate  Microsoft  Research.  Microsoft  Research  is  one  of  the  world’s
largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-
the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs; distributors and resellers; online; and Microsoft retail
stores.  Our  sales  force  performs  a  variety  of  functions,  including  working  directly  with  enterprises  and  public  sector  organizations  worldwide  to
identify and meet their software requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting solution integrators, independent software vendors,
and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products.

OEMs

We distribute software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new PCs, tablets, servers, phones, and other intelligent devices that they sell.
The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware pre-
installed with other Microsoft products, including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our Microsoft Office suite. In
addition to these products, we also market our services through OEMs and service bundles such as Windows with Bing or Windows with Office
365 subscription.

There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest OEMs, many of which operate globally, are referred to as “Direct OEMs,” as our relationship
with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our
products with virtually all of the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUSTeK, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba, and with
many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs consists of lower-volume PC manufacturers (also called “system builders”),
which  source  their  Microsoft  software  for  pre-installation  and  local  redistribution  primarily  through  the  Microsoft  distributor  channel  rather  than
through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.

Distributors and Resellers

Many organizations that license our products and services through enterprise agreements transact directly with us, with sales support from solution
integrators,  independent  software  vendors,  web  agencies,  and  developers  that  advise  organizations  on  licensing  our  products  and  services
(“Enterprise Agreement Direct Advisors”, or “EDAs”).

13

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 1

Organizations  also  license  our  products  and  services  indirectly,  primarily  through  license  solutions  partners  (“LSPs”),  distributors,  value-added
resellers (“VARs”), OEMs, system builder channels, and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LSPs
are  primarily  engaged  with  large  organizations,  distributors  resell  primarily  to  VARs,  and  VARs  typically  reach  small-sized  and  medium-sized
organizations. EDAs typically are also authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs, such as the Select Plus and
Open licensing programs discussed under “Licensing Options” below. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of
our largest resellers include CDW, Dell, Insight Enterprises, and Software House International.

Our  Microsoft  Dynamics  software  offerings  are  also  licensed  to  enterprises  through  a  global  network  of  channel  partners  providing  vertical
solutions and specialized services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized
replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets, including Microsoft retail stores.
We  distribute  our  hardware  products,  including  Surface,  Xbox,  phones,  and  PC  accessories,  through  third-party  retailers  and  Microsoft  retail
stores. Our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field
support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers, and provides product training and sales support.

Online

Although  on-premises  software  continues  to  be  an  important  part  of  our  business,  increasingly  we  are  delivering  additional  value  to  customers
through cloud-based services. We provide online content services to consumers through Bing, MSN portals and channels, Office 365, Windows
Phone  Store,  Xbox  Live,  Outlook.com,  OneDrive,  Skype,  and  Windows  Store.  We  also  provide  commercial  cloud-based  services  such  as
Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Azure, and Office 365. Other services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for
advertisers  and  publishers,  as  well  as  Microsoft  Developer  Network  subscription  content  and  updates,  periodic  product  updates,  and  online
technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions. As we increasingly deliver
online  services,  we  sell  many  of  these  cloud-based  services  through  our  enterprise  agreements  and  have  also  enabled  new  sales  programs  to
reach  small  and  medium-sized  businesses. These  programs  include  direct  sales,  direct  sales  supported  by  a  large  network  of  partner  advisors,
and resale of services through operator channels, such as telephone, cell, and cable providers.

We also sell our products through our Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces.

LICENSING OPTIONS

We  license  software  to  organizations  under  agreements  that  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of  products  and  services.  Our
agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without
having  to  acquire  separate  licenses  through  retail  channels.  In  delivering  organizational  licensing  agreements  to  the  market,  we  use  different
programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally
they include those discussed below.

Customer Licensing Programs

Open Licensing

Designed primarily for small-to-medium organizations, the Open Programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and, at
the  customer’s  election,  rights  to  future  versions  of  software  products  over  a  specified  time  period  (two  or  three  years  depending  on  the  Open
Programs  used).  The  offering  that  conveys  rights  to  future  versions  of  certain  software  products  over  the  contract  period  is  called  software
assurance.  Software  assurance  also  provides  support,  tools,  and  training  to  help  customers  deploy  and  use  software  efficiently.  The  Open
Programs have several variations to fit customers’ diverse ways of purchasing. Under the Open License Program, customers can acquire licenses
only or licenses with software assurance, and/or renew software assurance upon the expiration

14

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 1

of other existing volume licensing agreements. Under the Open Value and Open Value Subscription programs, customers can acquire perpetual or
subscription licenses, respectively, over a three-year period. Online services are available in each of the Open Programs.

Microsoft Product and Services Agreement

Suited  for  medium-to-large  organizations,  the  Microsoft  Products  and  Services  Agreement  (“MPSA”)  provides  customers  the  ability  to  purchase
online services subscriptions, software licenses, software licenses with software assurance, and renewals of software assurance through a single
agreement. Software assurance and online services subscriptions are generally available up to three years.

Select Plus Licensing

Designed  primarily  for  medium-to-large  organizations,  the  Select  Plus  Program  allows  customers  to  acquire  perpetual  licenses  and,  at  the
customer’s election, software assurance over a specified time period (generally three years or less). Similar to Open Programs, the Select Plus
Program allows customers to acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with software assurance, or renew software assurance upon the expiration of
existing  volume  licensing  agreements.  A  subset  of  online  services  are  also  available  for  purchase  through  the  Select  Plus  Program,  and
subscriptions  are  generally  structured  with  terms  between  one  and  three  years.  In  July  2014,  we  announced  that  we  would  no  longer  sign  new
Select Plus agreements with commercial organizations starting July 2015, and encouraged customers who want to purchase licenses to transition
to the MPSA. We expect Select Plus business to transition to the MPSA within a few years.

Enterprise Agreement Licensing

Designed primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations that want to acquire licenses to online services and/or software products, along with
software assurance and obtain the best value by standardizing on a common IT platform across the organization. Enterprises can elect to acquire
perpetual licenses or, under the Enterprise Subscription option, can acquire non-perpetual, subscription licenses for a specified period (generally
three  years).  Online  services  are  also  available  for  purchase  through  the  enterprise  agreement  and  subscriptions  are  generally  structured  with
three-year terms.

Customer Licensing Programs — Online Services Only

Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed to enable small and medium-sized businesses to easily purchase Microsoft Online Services.
The program allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.

Partner Programs

The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program enables partners to directly manage their entire Microsoft cloud customer lifecycle. Partners in this
program use dedicated in-product tools to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. Partners can easily package their
own tools, products, and services, and combine them into one monthly or annual customer bill.

The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement is a program targeted at service providers and independent software vendors allowing these
partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Agreements are generally structured with a three-year term,
and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption.

Microsoft Online Services Reseller Agreement is a program enabling partners to package Microsoft online services with the partners’ services.

Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program is a program that enables partners to use Microsoft software in their own software programs.

CUSTOMERS

Our customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-sized organizations, large global enterprises, public sector institutions, Internet
service providers, application developers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2015, 2014,
or  2013  revenue.  Our  practice  is  to  ship  our  products  promptly  upon  receipt  of  purchase  orders  from  customers;  consequently,  backlog  is  not
significant.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.

We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.

Competition in the technology sector

Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms
whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many
of  our  businesses  are  low  and  many  of  the  areas  in  which  we  compete  evolve  rapidly  with  changing  and  disruptive  technologies,  shifting  user
needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative
products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.

Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices

An  important  element  of  our  business  model  has  been  to  create  platform-based  ecosystems  on  which  many  participants  can  build  diverse
solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can
accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant
competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.

  A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related
services,  has  succeeded  with  some  consumer  products  such  as  personal  computers,  tablets,  phones,  gaming  consoles,  and
wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We
also  offer  some  vertically-integrated  hardware  and  software  products  and  services;  however,  our  competitors  in  smartphones  and
tablets have established significantly larger user bases. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model will increase
our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.

  We  derive  substantial  revenue  from  licenses  of  Windows  operating  systems  on  personal  computers.  We  face  significant  competition
from  competing  platforms  developed  for  new  devices  and  form  factors  such  as  smartphones  and  tablet  computers.  These  devices
compete  on  multiple  bases  including  price  and  the  perceived  utility  of  the  device  and  its  platform.  Users  are  increasingly  turning  to
these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as
complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to
our  PC  operating  system  platforms.  Competing  with  operating  systems  licensed  at  low  or  no  cost  may  decrease  our  PC  operating
system  margins.  In  addition,  some  of  our  devices  compete  with  products  made  by  our  OEM  partners,  which  may  affect  their
commitment to our platform.

  The success of the Windows Phone platform is an important element of our goal to enhance personal productivity in a mobile-first and
cloud-first world. The marketplace among mobile phone platforms is highly competitive. We may face issues in selecting, engaging, or
securing  support  from  operators  and  retailers  for  Windows  phones  due  to,  for  instance,  inadequate  sales  training  or  incentives,  or
insufficient marketing support for the Windows Phone platform.

  Competing platforms have application marketplaces (sometimes referred to as “stores”) with scale and significant installed bases. The
variety and utility of applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users incur costs to move data
and buy new applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our
marketplace  and  ensure  that  these  applications  have  high  quality,  customer  appeal,  and  value.  Efforts  to  compete  with  competitors’
application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins.

Business model competition

Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.

PART I
Item 1A

•

  Even  as  we  transition  to  a  mobile-first  and  cloud-first  strategy,  the  license-based  proprietary  software  model  generates  most  of  our
software  revenue.  We  bear  the  costs  of  converting  original  ideas  into  software  products  through  investments  in  research  and
development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and
sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.

  Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising.
Advertising  revenue  funds  development  of  products  and  services  these  competitors  provide  to  users  at  no  or  little  cost,  competing
directly with our revenue-generating products.

  Some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software at
nominal cost to end-users, and earning revenue on advertising or complementary services and products. These firms do not bear the
full costs of research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features
and functionality of our products.

The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for
research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.

Our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks.    A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services
available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the
mobile-first and cloud-first world. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and
business  customers.  Pricing  and  delivery  models  are  evolving.  Devices  and  form  factors  influence  how  users  access  services  in  the  cloud  and
sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-
based  strategies.  The  Windows  ecosystem  must  continue  to  evolve  with  this  changing  environment.  We  are  undertaking  cultural  and
organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. The Company’s increasing reliance on data-driven insights is
becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Besides
software  development  costs,  we  are  incurring  costs  to  build  and  maintain  infrastructure  to  support  cloud  computing  services.  These  costs  will
reduce  the  operating  margins  we  have  previously  achieved.  Whether  we  succeed  in  cloud-based  services  depends  on  our  execution  in  several
areas, including:

•

•

•

•

•

  Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.

  Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including

PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices.

  Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.

  Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data.

  Making our suite of cloud-based services platform agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of

our competitors.

It  is  uncertain  whether  our  strategies  will  attract  the  users  or  generate  the  revenue  required  to  succeed.  If  we  are  not  effective  in  executing
organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products
and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact
gross margins and operating income.

Item 1A

We  make  significant  investments  in  new  products  and  services  that  may  not  achieve  expected  returns.        We  will  continue  to  make
significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating
system,  the  Microsoft  Office  system,  Bing,  Windows  Phone,  Windows  Server,  the  Windows  Store,  the  Microsoft  Azure  Services  platform,  Office
365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of
hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology
are  speculative.  Commercial  success  depends  on  many  factors,  including  innovativeness,  developer  support,  and  effective  distribution  and
marketing.  If  customers  do  not  perceive  our  latest  offerings  as  providing  significant  new  functionality  or  other  value,  they  may  reduce  their
purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new
product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they
are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.

The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we
have  ever  undertaken.  We  have  done  extensive  preparation  and  compatibility  testing  for  applications  and  devices  to  help  ensure  a  positive
experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the
process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed. In addition, we
anticipate  that  Windows  10  will  enable  new  post-license  monetization  opportunities  beyond  initial  license  revenues.  Our  failure  to  realize  these
opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues.

Developing  new  technologies  is  complex.  It  can  require  long  development  and  testing  periods.  Significant  delays  in  new  releases  or  significant
problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.

Acquisitions,  joint  ventures,  and  strategic  alliances  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business.        We  expect  to  continue  making
acquisitions  and  entering  into  joint  ventures  and  strategic  alliances  as  part  of  our  long-term  business  strategy.  These  transactions  and
arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return
on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from
our  other  businesses.  If  an  arrangement  fails  to  adequately  anticipate  changing  circumstances  and  interests  of  a  party,  it  may  result  in  early
termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage
them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits
from  these  transactions  and  arrangements,  such  as  increased  revenue,  enhanced  efficiencies,  or  increased  market  share,  or  the  benefits  may
ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.

If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.    We
acquire  other  companies  and  intangible  assets  and  may  not  realize  all  the  economic  benefit  from  those  acquisitions,  which  could  cause  an
impairment  of  goodwill  or  intangibles.  We  review  our  amortizable  intangible  assets  for  impairment  when  events  or  changes  in  circumstances
indicate  the  carrying  value  may  not  be  recoverable.  We  test  goodwill  for  impairment  at  least  annually.  Factors  that  may  be  a  change  in
circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our
stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate.
We  may  be  required  to  record  a  significant  charge  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  during  the  period  in  which  any  impairment  of  our
goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal
year  2012,  we  recorded  a  $6.2  billion  charge  for  the  impairment  of  goodwill  in  our  previous  Online  Services  Division  business  (Devices  and
Consumer  Other  under  our  current  segment  structure),  and  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2015,  we  recorded  a  $5.1  billion  charge  for  the
impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets in our Phone Hardware segment.

We may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights.

We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights

PART I
Item 1A

Protecting  our  global  intellectual  property  rights  and  combating  unlicensed  copying  and  use  of  our  software  and  other  intellectual  property  is
difficult.  While  piracy  adversely  affects  U.S.  revenue,  the  impact  on  revenue  from  outside  the  U.S.  is  more  significant,  particularly  in  countries
where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market.
Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we
educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we
educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection
for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue.

We may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses

We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating
that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty. Changes in the
law  may  weaken  our  ability  to  prevent  the  use  of  patented  technology  or  collect  revenue  for  licensing  our  patents.  These  include  legislative
changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents.
Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations.
Finally, the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes
in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements.

Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.    From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property
rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent
coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia
phones. To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop
selling  or  redesign  affected  products  or  services,  or  pay  damages  to  satisfy  indemnification  commitments  with  our  customers.  These  outcomes
may  cause  operating  margins  to  decline.  Besides  money  damages,  in  some  jurisdictions  plaintiffs  can  seek  injunctive  relief  that  may  limit  or
prevent  importing,  marketing,  and  selling  our  products  or  services  that  have  infringing  technologies.  In  some  countries,  such  as  Germany,  an
injunction  can  be  issued  before  the  parties  have  fully  litigated  the  validity  of  the  underlying  patents.  We  have  paid  significant  amounts  to  settle
claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage
this risk, and may continue to do so.

We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.    Source code, the
detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our
application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our
source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. It may become
easier  for  third  parties  to  compete  with  our  products  by  copying  functionality,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  revenue  and  operating  margins.
Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.

Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive
position.

Security of Microsoft’s information technology

Threats  to  IT  security  can  take  a  variety  of  forms.  Individual  and  groups  of  hackers,  and  sophisticated  organizations  including  state-sponsored
organizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our IT. They may develop and deploy malicious
software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed
denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully
defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems,
and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business
applications,  impair  our  ability  to  provide  services  to  our  customers  and  protect  the  privacy  of  their  data,  result  in  product  development  delays,
compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or
other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways
of  sharing  data  and  communicating  internally  and  with  partners  and  customers  using  methods  such  as  social  networking  and  other  consumer-
oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.

Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data

Security  threats  are  a  particular  challenge  to  companies  like  us  whose  business  is  technology  products  and  services.  Threats  to  our  own  IT
infrastructure  can  also  affect  our  customers.  Customers  using  our  cloud-based  services  rely  on  the  security  of  our  infrastructure  to  ensure  the
reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and
services,  including  many  of  ours,  and  we  expect  that  to  continue.  The  security  of  our  products  and  services  is  important  in  our  customers’
purchasing decisions.

To  defend  against  security  threats,  both  to  our  internal  IT  systems  and  those  of  our  customers,  we  must  continuously  engineer  more  secure
products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities,
develop  mitigation  technologies  that  help  to  secure  customers  from  attacks  even  when  software  updates  are  not  deployed,  maintain  the  digital
security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and
anti-virus software.

The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our
products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services,
or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could
delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no
longer  support,  or  may  fail  timely  to  install  security  patches.  Any  of  these  actions  by  customers  could  adversely  affect  our  revenue.  Actual  or
perceived  vulnerabilities  may  lead  to  claims  against  us.  Although  our  license  agreements  typically  contain  provisions  that  eliminate  or  limit  our
exposure  to  liability,  there  is  no  assurance  these  provisions  will  withstand  legal  challenges.  Legislative  or  regulatory  action  in  these  areas  may
increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services.

Disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation.    As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based
offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. The continued occurrence of
high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve
the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our

22

Table of Contents

PART I
Item 1A

training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or
our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under
laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to
store  and  process  personal  data  on-premises  or,  increasingly,  in  a  cloud-based  environment  we  host.  Government  authorities  can  sometimes
require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these
requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that
the  privacy  of  personal  information  is  not  satisfactorily  protected  could  inhibit  sales  of  our  products  or  services,  and  could  limit  adoption  of  our
cloud-based  solutions  by  consumers,  businesses,  and  government  entities.  Additional  security  measures  we  may  take  to  address  customer
concerns,  or  constraints  on  our  flexibility  to  determine  where  and  how  to  operate  datacenters  in  response  to  customer  expectations  or
governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses.

We  may  have  outages,  data  losses,  and  disruptions  of  our  online  services  if  we  fail  to  maintain  an  adequate  operations
infrastructure.    Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power.
We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure
to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services
and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Exchange Online, Office 365, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, Microsoft
Azure, Outlook.com, Windows Stores, and Microsoft Account services. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end
hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex.
It  requires  that  we  maintain  an  Internet  connectivity  infrastructure  that  is  robust  and  reliable  within  competitive  and  regulatory  constraints  that
continue  to  evolve.  Inefficiencies  or  operational  failures,  including  temporary  or  permanent  loss  of  customer  data  or  insufficient  Internet
connectivity,  could  diminish  the  quality  of  our  products,  services,  and  user  experience  resulting  in  contractual  liability,  claims  by  customers  and
other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our
operating results and financial condition.

Government  litigation  and  regulatory  activity  relating  to  competition  rules  may  limit  how  we  design  and  market  our  products.        As  a
leading  global  software  and  device  maker,  we  are  closely  scrutinized  by  government  agencies  under  U.S.  and  foreign  competition  laws.  An
increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such
as the European Union, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct.
U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.

The European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make
certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. In 2004,
the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to
provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In
2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commission’s concerns relating to competition in web
browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired
in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the
Windows  platform,  and  increase  our  product  development  costs.  The  availability  of  licenses  related  to  protocols  and  file  formats  may  enable
competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products.

Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms. As a
result,  increasingly  we  both  cooperate  and  compete  with  our  OEM  partners,  creating  a  risk  that  we  fail  to  do  so  in  compliance  with  competition
rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced
arguments  under  their  competition  laws  that  exert  downward  pressure  on  royalties  for  our  intellectual  property.  Because  these  jurisdictions  only
recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable.

Item 1A

Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and
businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated. The
outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:

•

•

•

•

  We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative
versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality
that customers want or on which developers rely.

  We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do

not protect our associated intellectual property.

  The rulings described above may be precedent in other competition law proceedings.

  We  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  ongoing  commitments  because  of  court  or  administrative  orders,  consent  decrees,  or  other  voluntary
actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or
other remedial actions.

•

  Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.

Our  global  operations  subject  us  to  potential  liability  under  anti-corruption,  trade  protection,  and  other  laws  and  regulations.        The
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees,
vendors, or agents. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere about our business activities outside the
U.S.  and  our  compliance  with  Anti-Corruption  Laws.  While  we  devote  substantial  resources  to  our  global  compliance  programs  and  have
implemented  policies,  training,  and  internal  controls  designed  to  reduce  the  risk  of  corrupt  payments,  our  employees,  vendors,  or  agents  may
violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our
officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected
by changes in trade protection laws, policies, and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject
to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea,
Cuba, Sudan, and Syria.

Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and
protection,  and  online  content.  For  example,  regulators  may  take  the  position  that  our  offerings  such  as  Skype  are  covered  by  laws  regulating
telecommunications services. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes
may  conflict  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction.  Additionally,  these  laws  and  governments’  approach  to  their  enforcement,  and  our  products  and
services, are continuing to evolve. Increasing concern about government surveillance practices around the world may lead to increased regulation
requiring local data hosting obligations or the use of domestic hosting providers. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant
costs  or  require  changes  in  products  or  business  practices  that  result  in  reduced  revenue.  Noncompliance  could  result  in  the  imposition  of
penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in
some geographies.

Our  business  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  talented  employees.        Our  business  is  based  on  successfully  attracting  and
retaining  talented  employees.  The  market  for  highly  skilled  workers  and  leaders  in  our  industry  is  extremely  competitive.  We  are  limited  in  our
ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key
employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also
important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder
our strategic planning and execution.

We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.    We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse
outcomes  in  some  or  all  of  these  claims  may  result  in  significant  monetary  damages  or  injunctive  relief  that  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to
conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are

subject  to  inherent  uncertainties  and  management’s  view  of  these  matters  may  change  in  the  future.  A  material  adverse  impact  on  our
consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably
estimable.

We  may  have  additional  tax  liabilities.        We  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  many  foreign  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is
required  in  determining  our  worldwide  provision  for  income  taxes.  In  the  ordinary  course  of  our  business,  there  are  many  transactions  and
calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Economic and political pressures to
increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are
reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and
accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which
that determination is made.

We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to
the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws
that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what
form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.

Our  hardware  and  software  products  may  experience  quality  or  supply  problems.        Our  vertically-integrated  hardware  products  such  as
Xbox  consoles,  Surface  devices,  phones,  and  other  devices  we  design,  manufacture,  and  market  are  highly  complex  and  can  have  defects  in
design,  manufacture,  or  associated  software.  We  could  incur  significant  expenses,  lost  revenue,  and  reputational  harm  if  we  fail  to  detect  or
address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use
some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source
supplier  is  delayed  or  becomes  unavailable,  whether  because  of  supplier  capacity  constraint  or  industry  shortages,  we  may  not  obtain  timely
replacement  supplies,  resulting  in  reduced  sales.  Component  shortages,  excess  or  obsolete  inventory,  or  price  reductions  resulting  in  inventory
adjustments  may  increase  our  cost  of  revenue.  Xbox  consoles,  Surface  devices,  phones,  and  other  hardware  are  assembled  in  Asia  and  other
geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.
These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.

Our  software  products  also  may  experience  quality  or  reliability  problems.  The  highly  sophisticated  software  products  we  develop  may  contain
bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced
sales  and  revenue,  damage  to  our  reputation,  repair  or  remediation  costs,  delays  in  the  release  of  new  products  or  versions,  or  legal  liability.
Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions
will withstand legal challenge.

Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks.    Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part
of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a
significant  focus  of  our  international  growth  strategy.  The  developing  nature  of  these  markets  presents  several  risks,  including  deterioration  of
social,  political,  labor,  or  economic  conditions  in  a  country  or  region,  and  difficulties  in  staffing  and  managing  foreign  operations.  Although  we
hedge  a  portion  of  our  international  currency  exposure,  significant  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  between  the  U.S.  dollar  and  foreign
currencies  may  adversely  affect  our  revenue.  Competitive  or  regulatory  pressure  to  make  our  pricing  structure  uniform  might  require  that  we
reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries.

Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.    A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a
major  earthquake,  weather  event,  cyber-attack,  terrorist  attack,  or  other  catastrophic  event  could  cause  delays  in  completing  sales,  providing
services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and
certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the

25

Item 1A, 1B, 2

Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any
of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services
and  solutions  in  the  cloud  puts  a  premium  on  the  resilience  of  our  systems  and  strength  of  our  business  continuity  management  plans,  and
magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.

Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase
our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers,
and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either of which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects of
climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or
available  sources  of  energy  or  other  natural  resources  may  affect  the  availability  or  cost  of  goods  and  services,  including  natural  resources,
necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use
to develop software and provide cloud-based services.

Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business.    Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other
changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing
devices  declines,  or  consumer  or  business  spending  for  those  products  declines,  our  revenue  will  be  adversely  affected.  Substantial  revenue
comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt
continuing  funding  resolutions  or  raise  the  debt  ceiling,  and  other  budgetary  decisions  limiting  or  delaying  federal  government  spending,  could
reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue.

Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a
significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer,
could cause sales channel disruption.

Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result,
allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market,
and  interest  rate  risks,  which  may  be  exacerbated  by  unusual  events  that  affect  global  financial  markets.  A  significant  part  of  our  investment
portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S.
government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we
could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that
could adversely affect our financial results.

We  have  received  no  written  comments  regarding  our  periodic  or  current  reports  from  the  staff  of  the  SEC  that  were  issued  180  days  or  more
preceding the end of our fiscal year 2015 that remain unresolved.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial
condition  of  Microsoft  Corporation.  MD&A  is  provided  as  a  supplement  to,  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  consolidated  financial
statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.

OVERVIEW

Microsoft is a technology leader focused on building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We strive
to  empower  every  person  and  every  organization  on  the  planet  to  achieve  more.  We  develop  and  market  software,  services,  and  devices  that
deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives.

We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-
based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and
by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing,
manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, and income taxes.

Much  of  our  focus  in  fiscal  year  2015  was  toward  transforming  our  organization  to  support  our  strategy  of  building  best-in-class  platforms  and
productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes, and
made  strategic  and  tactical  moves  to  support  the  three  central  ambitions  that  support  our  strategy:  reinventing  productivity  and  business
processes; building the intelligent cloud platform; and creating more personal computing.

Highlights from fiscal year 2015 included:

•

•

•

  Momentum continued to grow in our Commercial Cloud and productivity offerings as we surpassed an $8 billion annualized run rate* at

the end of the year.

  Office 365 Commercial seats grew 74%, and Office 365 is now deployed in four out of five Fortune 500 enterprises, with more than half
of that install base using premium workloads. We also added over 50,000 small- and medium-sized business customers each month.

  Server  products  and  services  revenue  increased  9%,  driven  by  growth  across  our  cloud  and  on-premises  server  products.  Azure
revenue and compute usage increased by triple digits in the fourth quarter year over year, and we ended fiscal year 2015 with more
than 17,000 Enterprise Mobility Services customers.

* Annualized run rate was calculated by multiplying June 2015 revenue by twelve months.

  We reached over 8 million paid Dynamics seats and refreshed and enhanced Microsoft Dynamics ERP products. We also introduced

new social, productivity, mobility, customer service, and marketing capabilities in Dynamics CRM.

  We currently have more than 15 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, with new customers signing up at a current pace of nearly

one million per month. We also surpassed 150 million downloads of Office mobile to iOS and Android devices.

  Bing exceeded 20% U.S. market share as we focused our advertising business on search. In June 2015, we entered into agreements

with AOL and AppNexus to outsource our display sales efforts.

  In  hardware,  we  released  Surface  3  and  expanded  distribution  of  Surface  Pro  and  the  related  gross  margin  percentage  grew  with
increased  revenue,  and  introduced  new  categories  like  HoloLens  –  all  with  an  eye  toward  generating  new  growth  in  Windows  more
broadly.

  Xbox console volumes grew to over 12 million, and Xbox Live users increased 22%.

  We shipped over 36 million Lumia units, and announced the restructuring of our Phone Hardware business to run it more effectively

near-term while driving reinvention longer term.

  We completed 16 acquisitions, including Mojang Synergies AB (“Mojang”), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming

franchise, and others, to strengthen our cloud platform and invest in mobile applications.

  We advanced Windows 10 to the threshold of its launch in July 2015 with the help of the Windows Insider Program, a new paradigm to

incorporate unprecedented levels of user and developer feedback in our development process.

Industry Trends

Our  industry  is  dynamic  and  highly  competitive,  with  frequent  changes  in  both  technologies  and  business  models.  Each  industry  shift  is  an
opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we
push  the  boundaries  of  what  is  possible  through  a  broad  range  of  research  and  development  activities  that  seek  to  identify  and  address  the
changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.

Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks

The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and
devices,  while  also  deploying  competing  cloud-based  services  for  consumers  and  businesses.  The  devices  and  form  factors  customers  prefer
evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services
to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in
devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.

Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide.
Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the
ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for
our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.

Our  international  operations  provide  a  significant  portion  of  our  total  revenue  and  expenses.  Many  of  these  revenue  and  expenses  are
denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  As  a  result,  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  may  significantly  affect  revenue  and
expenses. Recently, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies has negatively impacted reported revenue
and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.

See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).

PART II
Item 7

Seasonality

Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar
year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Computing and Gaming Hardware segment is
particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically,
the Computing and Gaming Hardware segment has generated approximately 40-50% of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter.

Unearned Revenue

Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue, including:

•

•

•

  Revenue deferred on pre-sales of Windows to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and retailers before general availability.

  Revenue deferred on bundled products and services (“Bundled Offerings”).

  Revenue deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the “Windows Upgrade

Offer”).

If  our  customers  choose  to  license  cloud-based  versions  of  our  products  and  services  rather  than  licensing  transaction-based  products  and
services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or
upon consumption, as applicable.

Reportable Segments

The  segment  amounts  included  in  MD&A  are  presented  on  a  basis  consistent  with  our  internal  management  reporting.  Segment  information
appearing in Note 22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) is also
presented  on  this  basis.  All  differences  between  our  internal  management  reporting  basis  and  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the
United States (“U.S. GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other. Operating expenses are not
allocated  to  our  segments.  We  have  recast  certain  prior  period  amounts  to  conform  to  the  current  period  presentation,  with  no  impact  on
consolidated net income or cash flows.

On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services business (“NDS”). NDS has been included
in  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  since  the  acquisition  date.  We  report  the  financial  performance  of  the  acquired  business  in  our  Phone
Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our
Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with
the acquisition.

Our reportable segments are described below.

Devices and Consumer

Our  D&C  segments  develop,  manufacture,  market,  and  support  products  and  services  designed  to  entertain  and  connect  people,  increase
personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C
segments are:

•

  D&C Licensing, comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic
volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core

Revenue increased $6.7 billion or 8%, reflecting a full year of Phone Hardware sales and growth in revenue from our Commercial Cloud, Surface,
server  products,  search  advertising,  and  Xbox  Live  transactions.  These  increases  were  offset  in  part  by  a  decline  in  revenue  from  Office
Commercial,  Windows  OEM,  licensing  of  Windows  Phone  operating  system,  and  Office  Consumer.  Revenue  included  an  unfavorable  foreign
currency impact of approximately 2%.

Gross margin increased $787 million or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.0 billion or 22% increase in cost of revenue.
Cost of revenue increased, mainly due to Phone Hardware, as well as increasing costs in support of our Commercial Cloud, including $396 million
of higher datacenter expenses. Gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, improved year over year in each of our reportable segments.

Operating income decreased $9.6 billion or 35%, primarily due to impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in the current year, as well
as increased research and development expenses, offset in part by higher gross margin. Key changes in operating expenses were:

•

  Impairment,  integration,  and  restructuring  expenses  were  $10.0  billion  in  the  current  year,  reflecting  goodwill  and  asset  impairment
charges of $7.5 billion related to our Phone Hardware business, and $2.5 billion of integration and restructuring expenses, driven by
costs associated with our restructuring plans.

•

  Research and development expenses increased $665 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services,

including NDS expenses, offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses.

Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were negatively impacted by impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which decreased diluted EPS
by $1.15.

Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013

Revenue increased $9.0 billion or 12%, demonstrating growth across our consumer and commercial businesses, primarily due to higher revenue
from server products, Xbox Platform, Commercial Cloud, and Surface. Revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Commercial Cloud
revenue doubled, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud-based offerings.

Gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 4%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.7 billion or 33% increase in cost of revenue. Cost
of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface devices sold, and $575 million of higher datacenter expenses,
primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth. Cost of revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS.

Operating income increased $995 million or 4%, reflecting higher gross margin, offset in part by increased research and development expenses
and sales and marketing expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:

•

Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

D&C revenue increased $3.9 billion or 10%, primarily due to a full year of Phone Hardware sales, as well as higher revenue from Surface, search
advertising,  and  Xbox  Live  transactions,  offset  in  part  by  a  decrease  in  revenue  from  Windows  OEM,  licensing  of  Windows  Phone  operating
system, and Office Consumer. Collectively, Office Consumer and Office 365 Consumer revenue declined 17%. D&C gross margin decreased $1.4
billion or 7%, reflecting higher cost of revenue, offset in part by higher revenue. D&C cost of revenue increased $5.3 billion or 30%, mainly due to a
full year of Phone Hardware costs.

D&C Licensing

D&C Licensing revenue decreased $4.6 billion or 23%, mainly due to lower revenue from Windows OEM, Windows Phone licensing, and Office
Consumer. Windows OEM revenue declined $1.9 billion or 15%, primarily due to declines of 15% in OEM Pro revenue and 16% in OEM non-Pro
revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue decreased, primarily due to benefits realized from the expiration of support for Windows XP in the prior year,
and declines in the business PC market. Windows OEM non-Pro revenue declined, mainly due to an increased mix of opening price point devices
sold,  and  declines  in  the  consumer  PC  market.  Revenue  from  licensing  of  Windows  Phone  operating  system  decreased  $1.4  billion  or  55%,
primarily  due  to  prior  year  revenue  associated  with  our  joint  strategic  initiatives  with  Nokia  that  terminated  when  we  acquired  NDS.  Office
Consumer  revenue  declined  $946  million  or  29%,  reflecting  the  transition  of  customers  to  Office  365  Consumer,  where  revenue  is  recognized
ratably, and declines in the Japan PC market, where Office is predominantly pre-installed on new PCs.

D&C  Licensing  gross  margin  decreased  $3.6  billion  or  20%,  primarily  due  to  the  decline  in  revenue,  offset  in  part  by  a  $990  million  or  47%
decrease in cost of revenue. D&C Licensing cost of revenue decreased, mainly due to a $788 million decline in traffic acquisition costs, driven by
prior year costs associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia that terminated when we acquired NDS.

revenue from Xbox Platform. Surface revenue increased 65% to $3.6 billion, primarily due to Surface Pro 3 units sold. Surface Pro 3 was released
in June 2014. Xbox Platform revenue decreased $385 million or 6%, driven by lower prices of Xbox One consoles compared to the prior year, as
well  as  a  decrease  in  second-  and  third-party  video  games  revenue.  We  sold  12.1  million  Xbox  consoles  in  fiscal  year  2015  compared  with
11.7 million consoles in fiscal year 2014.

General and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year.

Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013

General and administrative expenses decreased $336 million or 7%, mainly due to the European Commission fine in the prior year, offset in part by

Impairment,  integration,  and  restructuring  expenses  were  $10.0  billion  for  fiscal  year  2015,  compared  to  $127  million  for  fiscal  year  2014.  The
increase was mainly due to impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our Phone Hardware business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.
Our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of Phone Hardware goodwill exceeded its estimated fair
value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing Phone Hardware’s goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million,
net of foreign currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of Phone Hardware intangible
assets. Restructuring charges were $2.1 billion, including employee severance expenses and the write-down of certain assets in connection with
our  restructuring  activities.  Integration  expenses  increased  $308  million,  due  to  a  full-year  of  integration  activities  in  fiscal  year  2015  associated

We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns;
and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily
recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the
gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on
certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes.

Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

Dividends  and  interest  income  decreased  due  to  lower  yields  on  fixed  income  securities,  offset  in  part  by  higher  portfolio  balances.  Interest
expense  increased  due  to  higher  outstanding  long-term  debt.  Net  recognized  gains  on  investments  increased  primarily  due  to  higher  gains  on
sales of equity securities, offset in part by higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $183 million in fiscal
year 2015, compared with $106 million in fiscal year 2014. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity contracts in the current
period as compared to gains in the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on currency and equity contracts. For fiscal year 2015, other reflects
recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures.

Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013

Dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt.
Net  recognized  gains  on  investments  increased  primarily  due  to  higher  gains  on  sales  of  equity  securities  and  lower  other-than-temporary
impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $106 million in fiscal year 2014, compared with $208 million in fiscal year 2013. Net losses
on derivatives increased due to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts, losses on equity derivatives as compared to gains in the prior period,
offset in part by gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period. For fiscal year 2014, other reflects
recognized losses from certain joint ventures, offset in part by a recognized gain on a divestiture. For fiscal year 2013, other reflects recognized
gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the MSNBC joint venture.

Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

INCOME TAXES

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was approximately 34% and 21%, respectively. The fiscal year 2015 effective rate increased
by 13%, primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year 2015, most of which did not generate a
tax benefit. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from
producing  and  distributing  our  products  and  services  through  our  foreign  regional  operations  centers  in  Ireland,  Singapore,  and  Puerto  Rico.  In
fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of
impairment and restructuring charges.

Item 7

Changes  in  the  mix  of  income  before  income  taxes  between  the  U.S.  and  foreign  countries  also  impacted  our  effective  tax  rates  and  resulted
primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. We supply our Windows
PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products
and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our U.S. income before income taxes was
$7.4 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, and comprised 40% and 26%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2015 and
2014, our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 60% and 74%, respectively, of our
income before income taxes.

Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $12.1 billion and $10.4 billion as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included
in  other  long-term  liabilities.  This  increase  relates  primarily  to  adjustments  to  prior  years’  liabilities  for  intercompany  transfer  pricing  and
adjustments related to our IRS audits. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year
2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase
of  the  examination.  As  of  June  30,  2015,  the  primary  unresolved  issue  relates  to  transfer  pricing,  which  could  have  a  significant  impact  on  our
consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not
received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on
the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next
12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2015.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years  1996  to  2015,  some  of  which  are  currently  under  audit  by  local  tax  authorities.  The  resolutions  of  these  audits  are  not  expected  to  be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S.
federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products
and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.

Our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $458 million to prior years’ liabilities for
intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as well as losses incurred by NDS and changes in
the geographic mix of our business. This was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily
Denmark.

Changes  in  the  mix  of  income  before  income  taxes  between  the  U.S.  and  foreign  countries  also  impacted  our  effective  tax  rates  and  resulted
primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. We supply our Windows
PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products
and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. Windows PC operating system revenue decreased $655 million in fiscal
year  2014,  while  Microsoft  Office  system  and  server  products  and  tools  revenue  increased  $1.3  billion  and  $1.6  billion,  respectively,  during  this
same period. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.1 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, and comprised
26% and 25%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7
billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 74% and 75%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $96.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, compared with $85.7 billion as of June 30, 2014.
Equity and other investments were $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2015, compared with $14.6 billion as of June 30, 2014. Our short-term investments
are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital

preservation.  They  consist  predominantly  of  highly  liquid  investment-grade  fixed-income  securities,  diversified  among  industries  and  individual
issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order
to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-
income  portfolio  are  managed  to  achieve  economic  returns  that  correlate  to  certain  fixed-income  indices.  The  settlement  risk  related  to  these
investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.

Of  the  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  at  June  30,  2015,  $94.4  billion  was  held  by  our  foreign  subsidiaries  and  would  be
subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject
to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.1 billion. As of June 30, 2015, approximately
79% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities,
approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and
asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Securities lending

We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on
our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the
underlying  security  lent  and  the  creditworthiness  of  the  borrower.  Cash  received  is  recorded  as  an  asset  with  a  corresponding  liability.  Our
securities lending payable balance was $92 million as of June 30, 2015. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the
fiscal year were $287 million and $750 million, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in
the demand for the securities.

Valuation

In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial
instruments.  This  pricing  methodology  applies  to  our  Level  1  investments,  such  as  exchange-traded  mutual  funds,  domestic  and  international
equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value,
then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly.
This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government
bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued
using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable
inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.

A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a
quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used
mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair
values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the
broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments
have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes
include controls  that  are  designed  to  ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model
inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

Cash Flows

Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014

PART II
Item 7

Cash  flows  from  operations  decreased  $3.2  billion  during  the  fiscal  year  to  $29.1  billion,  mainly  due  to  an  increase  in  materials  and  production
costs  in  support  of  sales  growth  as  well  as  payments  related  to  restructuring  charges  and  other  changes  in  working  capital,  offset  in  part  by
increases in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing increased $686 million to $9.1 billion, mainly due to a $7.1 billion increase in
cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash
used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and
maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets.

Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013

Cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during fiscal year 2014 to $32.2 billion, mainly due to increases in cash received from customers.
Cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a
$1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion
increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, mainly due to a
$10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in cash used for
acquisition  of  companies  and  purchases  of  intangible  and  other  assets,  and  a  $1.2  billion  increase  in  capital  expenditures  for  property  and
equipment.

Debt

We  issued  debt  to  take  advantage  of  favorable  pricing  and  liquidity  in  the  debt  markets,  reflecting  our  credit  rating  and  the  low  interest  rate
environment.  The  proceeds  of  these  issuances  were  or  will  be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes,  which  may  include,  among  other  things,
funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. See Note 12 – Debt of
the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.

Unearned Revenue

Unearned revenue at June 30, 2015 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume
licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at
the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned
revenue  at  June  30,  2015  also  included  payments  for:  post-delivery  support  and  consulting  services  to  be  performed  in  the  future;  Xbox  Live
subscriptions  and  prepaid  points;  Microsoft  Dynamics  business  solutions  products;  Office  365  subscriptions;  Skype  prepaid  credits  and
subscriptions; Bundled Offerings; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service
or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2015:

Share Repurchases

PART II
Item 7

On September 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. The
share  repurchase  program  became  effective  on  October  1,  2013,  has  no  expiration  date,  and  may  be  suspended  or  discontinued  at  any  time
without  notice.  While  the  program  has  no  expiration  date,  we  intend  to  complete  it  by  December  31,  2016.  As  of  June  30,  2015,  $21.9  billion
remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program.

During  fiscal  year  2015,  we  repurchased  295  million  shares  of  Microsoft  common  stock  for  $13.2  billion  under  the  share  repurchase  program
approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175 million shares for $6.4 billion; 128 million
shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013, and
47 million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008 and expired
September 30, 2013. During fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 158 million shares for $4.6 billion, under the share repurchase program announced
on September 22, 2008. All repurchases were made using cash resources.

Dividends

See Note 19 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We  provide  indemnifications  of  varying  scope  and  size  to  certain  customers  against  claims  of  intellectual  property  infringement  made  by  third
parties  arising  from  the  use  of  our  products  and  certain  other  matters.  In  evaluating  estimated  losses  on  these  indemnifications,  we  consider
factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These
obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.

Other Planned Uses of Capital

PART II
Item 7

We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue
making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers,
and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to
increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and
support  offices  and  certain  equipment.  We  have  not  engaged  in  any  related  party  transactions  or  arrangements  with  unconsolidated  entities  or
other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.

Liquidity

We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a
result,  as  discussed  above  under  Cash,  Cash  Equivalents,  and  Investments,  the  majority  of  our  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term
investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic
cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our
domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and
material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash,
cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and
cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable
future.

Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities,
such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the
U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our
earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.

See Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  Preparing  consolidated  financial
statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  and
expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us
include  revenue  recognition,  impairment  of  investment  securities,  goodwill,  research  and  development  costs,  contingencies,  income  taxes,  and
inventories.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue  recognition  for  multiple-element  arrangements  requires  judgment  to  determine  if  multiple  elements  exist,  whether  elements  can  be
accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.

Judgment  is  also  required  to  assess  whether  future  releases  of  certain  software  represent  new  products  or  upgrades  and  enhancements  to
existing  products.  Certain  volume  licensing  arrangements  include  a  perpetual  license  for  current  products  combined  with  rights  to  receive
unspecified  future  versions  of  software  products  and  are  accounted  for  as  subscriptions,  with  billings  recorded  as  unearned  revenue  and
recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.

46

Table of Contents

PART II
Item 7

Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue
to  be  deferred  and  recognized  when  the  upgrade  is  delivered.  If  it  is  determined  that  implied  post-contract  customer  support  (“PCS”)  is  being
provided,  revenue  from  the  arrangement  is  deferred  and  recognized  over  the  implied  PCS  term.  If  updates  are  determined  to  not  meet  the
definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over
different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices
at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be
used  for  allocating  revenue  to  elements:  (i)  vendor-specific  objective  evidence  of  fair  value  (“VSOE”),  (ii)  third-party  evidence,  and  (iii)  best
estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in
establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a
product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best
estimates  of  what  the  selling  prices  would  be  if  the  deliverables  were  sold  regularly  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  Our  process  for  determining  ESPs
requires  judgment  and  considers  multiple  factors  that  may  vary  over  time  depending  upon  the  unique  facts  and  circumstances  related  to  each
deliverable.

In  January  2015,  we  announced  Windows  10  will  be  free  to  all  qualified  existing  users  of  Windows  7  and  Windows  8.1.  This  offer  differs  from
historical  offers  preceding  the  launch  of  new  versions  of  Windows  as  it  is  being  made  available  for  free  to  existing  users  in  addition  to  new
customers  after  the  offer  announcement.  We  evaluated  the  nature  and  accounting  treatment  of  the  Windows  10  offer  and  determined  that  it
represents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users. As this is a marketing
and promotional activity, revenue recognition of new sales of Windows 8 will continue to be recognized as delivered.

Impairment of Investment Securities

We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this
judgment,  we  employ  a  systematic  methodology  quarterly  that  considers  available  quantitative  and  qualitative  evidence  in  evaluating  potential
impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions,
credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and
ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more
likely  than  not  that  we  will  be  required  to  sell  the  security  before  recovery.  We  also  consider  specific  adverse  conditions  related  to  the  financial
health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing
cash  flow  factors.  Once  a  decline  in  fair  value  is  determined  to  be  other-than-temporary,  an  impairment  charge  is  recorded  to  other  income
(expense),  net  and  a  new  cost  basis  in  the  investment  is  established.  If  market,  industry,  and/or  investee  conditions  deteriorate,  we  may  incur
future impairments.

Goodwill

We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting
units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the
reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an
event  occurs  or  circumstances  change  that  would  more  likely  than  not  reduce  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  below  its  carrying  value.  These
events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or
sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to
reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting
unit is estimated primarily through the use of a

47

Table of Contents

PART II
Item 7

discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on
internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and
determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other
factors.  Changes  in  these  estimates  and  assumptions  could  materially  affect  the  determination  of  fair  value  and  goodwill  impairment  for  each
reporting unit.

Based  on  the  results  of  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  testing  as  of  May  1,  2015,  we  determined  that  goodwill  associated  with  our  Phone
Hardware reporting unit was impaired, resulting in a material charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. As of June 30, 2015, none
of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of impairment.

Research and Development Costs

Costs  incurred  internally  in  researching  and  developing  a  computer  software  product  are  charged  to  expense  until  technological  feasibility  has
been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for
general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined
that  technological  feasibility  for  our  software  products  is  reached  after  all  high-risk  development  issues  have  been  resolved  through  coding  and
testing.  Generally,  this  occurs  shortly  before  the  products  are  released  to  manufacturing.  The  amortization  of  these  costs  is  included  in  cost  of
revenue over the estimated life of the products.

Legal and Other Contingencies

The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency
such  as  a  legal  proceeding  or  claim  is  accrued  by  a  charge  to  income  if  it  is  probable  that  an  asset  has  been  impaired  or  a  liability  has  been
incurred  and  the  amount  of  the  loss  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  In  determining  whether  a  loss  should  be  accrued  we  evaluate,  among  other
factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these
factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax
liabilities  and  assets  for  the  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have  been  recognized  in  an  entity’s  financial  statements  or  tax  returns.  We
recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also
provides  guidance  on  derecognition  of  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  classification  of  current  and  deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities,
accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax
consequences  of  events  that  have  been  recognized  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  or  tax  returns.  Variations  in  the  actual  outcome  of
these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

Inventories

PART II
Item 7

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to
the  purchase  and  production  of  inventories.  We  regularly  review  inventory  quantities  on  hand,  future  purchase  commitments  with  our  suppliers,
and  the  estimated  utility  of  our  inventory.  These  reviews  include  analysis  of  demand  forecasts,  product  life  cycle  status,  product  development
plans,  current  sales  levels,  pricing  strategy,  and  component  cost  trends.  If  our  review  indicates  a  reduction  in  utility  below  carrying  value,  we
reduce  our  inventory  to  a  new  cost  basis  through  a  charge  to  cost  of  revenue.  The  determination  of  market  value  and  the  estimated  volume  of
demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report.
The  consolidated  financial  statements,  which  include  amounts  based  on  management’s  estimates  and  judgments,  have  been  prepared  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are
safeguarded  against  loss  from  unauthorized  use  or  disposition,  and  that  the  financial  records  are  reliable  for  preparing  consolidated  financial
statements  and  maintaining  accountability  for  assets.  These  systems  are  augmented  by  written  policies,  an  organizational  structure  providing
division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.

The  Company  engaged  Deloitte  &  Touche  LLP,  an  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,  to  audit  and  render  an  opinion  on  the
consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).

The  Board  of  Directors,  through  its  Audit  Committee,  consisting  solely  of  independent  directors  of  the  Company,  meets  periodically  with
management,  internal  auditors,  and  our  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  to  ensure  that  each  is  meeting  its  responsibilities  and  to
discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access
to the Audit Committee.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

RISKS

PART II
Item 7A

We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these
risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Currency

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and
use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies
hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.

Interest Rate

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and
average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income
indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-
backed securities.

Equity

Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities
relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.

Commodity

We  use  broad-based  commodity  exposures  to  enhance  portfolio  returns  and  facilitate  portfolio  diversification.  Our  investment  portfolio  has
exposure  to  a  variety  of  commodities,  including  precious  metals,  energy,  and  grain.  We  manage  these  exposures  relative  to  global  commodity
indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.

VALUE-AT-RISK

We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair
value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in
fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and
management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and
correlations among foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.

The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could
exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.

The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 and for the year ended June 30,

less at June 30, 2015, and 25% less at June 30, 2014, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification
benefit of the combination of risks.

Accounting Principles

PART II
Item 8

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

We  have  recast  certain  prior  period  amounts  to  conform  to  the  current  period  presentation,  with  no  impact  on  consolidated  net  income  or  cash
flows.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are
not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to
exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.

Estimates and Assumptions

Preparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,
revenue,  and  expenses.  Examples  of  estimates  include:  loss  contingencies;  product  warranties;  the  fair  value  of,  and/or  potential  impairment  of
goodwill and intangibles assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful
accounts;  allowances  for  product  returns;  the  market  value  of  our  inventory;  and  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates.  Examples  of
assumptions  include:  the  elements  comprising  a  software  arrangement,  including  the  distinction  between  upgrades  or  enhancements  and  new
products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual
results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.

Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are
translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  this  process  are  recorded  to  other
comprehensive income (“OCI”).

Revenue Recognition

Revenue  is  recognized  when  persuasive  evidence  of  an  arrangement  exists,  delivery  has  occurred,  the  fee  is  fixed  or  determinable,  and
collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently
remitted to governmental authorities.

Revenue  recognition  for  multiple-element  arrangements  requires  judgment  to  determine  if  multiple  elements  exist,  whether  elements  can  be
accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.

Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over
different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices
at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be
used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence,

58

Table of Contents

PART II
Item 8

and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the
use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by
management  for  a  product  that  is  not  yet  sold  if  it  is  probable  that  the  price  will  not  change  before  introduction  into  the  marketplace.  ESPs  are
established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for
determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances
related to each deliverable.

Revenue  for  retail  packaged  products,  products  licensed  to  original  equipment  manufacturers  (“OEMs”),  and  perpetual  licenses  under  certain
volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights
to  use  upcoming  new  versions  of  a  software  product  if  they  license  existing  versions  of  the  product  during  the  eligibility  period.  Revenue  is
allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered.
The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the
price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near
future at the price set by management.

Software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an
upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or
if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element
arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not
exist.  If  updates  are  determined  to  not  meet  the  definition  of  an  upgrade,  revenue  is  generally  recognized  as  products  are  shipped  or  made
available.

Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions
of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings
recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for
current  products  with  the  right  to  use  unspecified  future  versions  of  the  software  during  the  coverage  period,  are  also  accounted  for  as
subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.

Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined
period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized
as  revenue  ratably  over  the  coverage  period  beginning  on  the  date  the  service  is  made  available  to  customers.  Revenue  from  cloud-based
services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized
commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.

Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as
subscriptions.  These  arrangements  are  considered  multiple-element  arrangements.  However,  because  all  elements  are  accounted  for  as
subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.

Revenue  related  to  phones,  Surface  devices,  Xbox  consoles,  games  published  by  us,  and  other  hardware  components  is  generally  recognized
when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A
portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for
games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.

Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the
search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been

completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting
arrangement  and  the  number  of  hours  worked  during  the  period.  Consulting  revenue  for  fixed-price  services  arrangements  is  recognized  as
services are  provided.  Revenue  from  prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the
points and delivery of the software or services.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support
service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to
acquire  online  advertising  space;  costs  incurred  to  support  and  maintain  Internet-based  products  and  services,  including  datacenter  costs  and
royalties;  warranty  costs;  inventory  valuation  adjustments;  costs  associated  with  the  delivery  of  consulting  services;  and  the  amortization  of
capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.

Product Warranty

We  provide  for  the  estimated  costs  of  fulfilling  our  obligations  under  hardware  and  software  warranties  at  the  time  the  related  revenue  is
recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair
costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product
sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years.
For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly
reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Research and Development

Research  and  development  expenses  include  payroll,  employee  benefits,  stock-based  compensation  expense,  and  other  headcount-related
expenses  associated  with  product  development.  Research  and  development  expenses  also  include  third-party  development  and  programming
costs,  localization  costs  incurred  to  translate  software  for  international  markets,  and  the  amortization  of  purchased  software  code  and  services
content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility
is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is
reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.

Sales and Marketing

Sales  and  marketing  expenses  include  payroll,  employee  benefits,  stock-based  compensation  expense,  and  other  headcount-related  expenses
associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising
costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Advertising  expense  was  $1.9  billion,  $2.3  billion,  and  $2.6  billion  in  fiscal  years  2015,  2014,  and  2013,
respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

PART II
Item 8

Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day
of each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to
upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.

Income Taxes

Income  tax  expense  includes  U.S.  and  international  income  taxes,  the  provision  for  U.S.  taxes  on  undistributed  earnings  of  international
subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not
reported  in  tax  returns  and  financial  statements  in  the  same  year.  The  tax  effect  of  such  temporary  differences  is  reported  as  deferred  income
taxes.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  reported  net  of  a  valuation  allowance  when  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  a  tax  benefit  will  not  be  realized.  The
deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.

Fair Value Measurements

We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs
used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:

•

•

•

  Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative
investments  primarily  include  U.S.  government  securities,  domestic  and  international  equities,  and  actively  traded  mutual  funds.  Our
Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.

  Level  2  –  inputs  are  based  upon  quoted  prices  for  similar  instruments  in  active  markets,  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar
instruments  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  and  model-based  valuation  techniques  (e.g.  the  Black-Scholes  model)  for  which  all
significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using
market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for
currencies  and  commodities.  Our  Level  2  non-derivative  investments  consist  primarily  of  corporate  notes  and  bonds,  common  and
preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and foreign government bonds. Our
Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.

  Level  3  –  inputs  are  generally  unobservable  and  typically  reflect  management’s  estimates  of  assumptions  that  market  participants
would  use  in  pricing  the  asset  or  liability.  The  fair  values  are  therefore  determined  using  model-based  techniques,  including  option
pricing  models  and  discounted  cash  flow  models.  Our  Level  3  non-derivative  assets  primarily  comprise  investments  in  common  and
preferred stock and goodwill when it is recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are
significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. Our Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include equity derivatives.

We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily  impaired.  The  fair  values  of  these  investments  are  determined  based  on  valuation  techniques  using  the  best  information
available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded
when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.

Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.

61

Table of Contents

Financial Instruments

PART II
Item 8

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months
and  remaining  maturities  of  less  than  one  year  are  classified  as  short-term  investments.  Investments  with  maturities  beyond  one  year  may  be
classified  as  short-term  based  on  their  highly  liquid  nature  and  because  such  marketable  securities  represent  the  investment  of  cash  that  is
available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses
are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI.

Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. With the exception of certain corporate notes that
are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded  using  the  specific  identification  method.  Changes  in  the  market  value  of  available-for-sale  securities,  excluding  other-than-temporary
impairments, are reflected in OCI. Held-to-maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. Common and preferred stock and other
investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.

We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on
our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the
underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.

Investments  are  considered  to  be  impaired  when  a  decline  in  fair  value  is  judged  to  be  other-than-temporary.  Fair  value  is  calculated  based  on
publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis
that  considers  available  quantitative  and  qualitative  evidence  in  evaluating  potential  impairment  of  our  investments.  If  the  cost  of  an  investment
exceeds  its  fair  value,  we  evaluate,  among  other  factors,  general  market  conditions,  credit  quality  of  debt  instrument  issuers,  the  duration  and
extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-
income  securities,  we  also  evaluate  whether  we  have  plans  to  sell  the  security  or  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  we  will  be  required  to  sell  the
security  before  recovery.  We  also  consider  specific  adverse  conditions  related  to  the  financial  health  of  and  business  outlook  for  the  investee,
including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is
determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is
established.

Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of
a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the
offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time
value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.

For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a
component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as
cash-flow  hedges,  changes  in  the  time  value  are  excluded  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  and  are  recognized  in  earnings.  Gains
(losses)  on  derivatives  representing  either  hedge  components  excluded  from  the  assessment  of  effectiveness  or  hedge  ineffectiveness  are
recognized in earnings.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income
(expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment

Item 8

purposes,  such  as  commodity  contracts,  the  gains  (losses)  are  generally  economically  offset  by  unrealized  gains  (losses)  in  the  underlying
available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which
time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) into other income (expense), net.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the
allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful
accounts was as follows:

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to
the  purchase  and  production  of  inventories.  We  regularly  review  inventory  quantities  on  hand,  future  purchase  commitments  with  our  suppliers,
and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost
basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or
market analysis require significant judgment.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or
the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for
internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements,
three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.

Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May
1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit below its carrying value.

Intangible Assets

All  of  our  intangible  assets  are  subject  to  amortization  and  are  amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  their  estimated  period  of  benefit,
ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that
may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

PART II
Item 8

In  May  2014,  as  part  of  its  ongoing  efforts  to  assist  in  the  convergence  of  U.S.  GAAP  and  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  the
Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  a  new  standard  related  to  revenue  recognition.  Under  the  new  standard,  recognition  of
revenue  occurs  when  a  customer  obtains  control  of  promised  goods  or  services  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  which  the  entity
expects  to  receive  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.  In  addition,  the  standard  requires  disclosure  of  the  nature,  amount,  timing,  and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and
adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is permitted. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact.

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares
outstanding  during  the  period  using  the  treasury  stock  method.  Dilutive  potential  common  shares  include  outstanding  stock  options  and  stock
awards.

In  addition  to  the  investments  in  the  table  above,  we  also  own  corporate  notes  that  are  classified  as  held-to-maturity  investments,  which  are
included in equity and other investments on the balance sheet. These corporate notes are due October 31, 2023 and are measured at fair value on
a nonrecurring basis. As of June 30, 2015, the amortized cost and recorded basis of these corporate notes were both $25 million with an estimated
fair  value  that  approximates  the  carrying  value.  As  of  June  30,  2014,  the  amortized  cost,  recorded  basis,  and  estimated  fair  value  of  these
corporate notes was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $164 million.

As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly
traded were $561 million and $520 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-
than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.

We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings
and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for
the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. As of June 30,
2015, collateral received under these agreements totaled $92 million which is comprised of $79 million of certificates of deposit and $13 million of
U.S. government and agency securities. The contractual maturities of these agreements are primarily on a continuous and overnight basis.

Unrealized  losses  from  fixed-income  securities  are  primarily  attributable  to  changes  in  interest  rates.  Unrealized  losses  from  domestic  and
international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-
temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of June 30, 2015.

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES

We  use  derivative  instruments  to  manage  risks  related  to  foreign  currencies,  equity  prices,  interest  rates,  and  credit;  to  enhance  investment
returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the
economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.

Our  derivative  programs  include  strategies  that  both  qualify  and  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  treatment.  All  notional  amounts  presented
below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.

Table of Contents

Foreign Currency

PART II
Item 8

Certain  forecasted  transactions,  assets,  and  liabilities  are  exposed  to  foreign  currency  risk.  We  monitor  our  foreign  currency  exposures  daily  to
maximize  the  economic  effectiveness  of  our  foreign  currency  hedge  positions.  Option  and  forward  contracts  are  used  to  hedge  a  portion  of
forecasted  international  revenue  for  up  to  three  years  in  the  future  and  are  designated  as  cash  flow  hedging  instruments.  Principal  currencies
hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, the total
notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $9.8 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.

Foreign  currency  risks  related  to  certain  non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  securities  are  hedged  using  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  that  are
designated  as  fair  value  hedging  instruments.  As  of  June  30,  2015  and  June  30,  2014,  the  total  notional  amounts  of  these  foreign  exchange
contracts sold were $5.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively.

Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain
balance  sheet  amounts  and  to  manage  other  foreign  currency  exposures.  As  of  June  30,  2015,  the  total  notional  amounts  of  these  foreign
exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these
foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.

Equity

Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based
global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging
instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls,
swaps, and forwards. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were
$2.2  billion  and  $2.6  billion,  respectively,  of  which  $1.1  billion  and  $1.4  billion,  respectively,  were  designated  as  hedging  instruments.  As  of
June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion,
respectively, of which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.

Interest Rate

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of
our  fixed-income  portfolio  to  achieve  economic  returns  that  correlate  to  certain  broad-based  fixed-income  indices  using  exchange-traded  option
and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2015,
the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2014,
the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.7 billion and $936 million, respectively.

In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed
securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available
delivery date. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $812 million and $1.1
billion, respectively.

Credit

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated
as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default
swaps  as  they  are  a  low-cost  method  of  managing  exposure  to  individual  credit  risks  or  groups  of  credit  risks.  As  of  June  30,  2015,  the  total
notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $618 million and $430 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional
amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $550 million and $440 million, respectively.

68

Table of Contents

Commodity

PART II
Item 8

We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on
commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious
metals, energy, and grain. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882 million and $316
million, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $408 million,
respectively.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured
debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these
requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2015,
our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be
posted.

credit risk:

We estimate that $492 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30, 2015 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12
months.  No  significant  amounts  of  gains  (losses)  were  reclassified  from  AOCI  into  earnings  as  a  result  of  forecasted  transactions  that  failed  to
occur during fiscal year 2015.

Non-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses)

Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense),
net.  These  amounts  are  shown  in  the  table  below,  with  the  exception  of  gains  (losses)  on  derivatives  presented  in  income  statement  line  items
other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment
purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying
available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on certain balance sheet amounts.

Mojang Synergies AB

PART II
Item 8

NOTE 9 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On November 6, 2014, we acquired Mojang Synergies AB (“Mojang”), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, for
$2.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and
other ecosystems besides our own. Our purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed
and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available, including additional information relating to tax matters and
finalization of our valuation of identified intangible assets.

The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable
intangible assets of $928 million, primarily marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily
attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our
Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Other segment. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.3
years. Mojang has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date.

Nokia’s Devices and Services Business

On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services business (“NDS”) for a total purchase price
of $9.4 billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (the “Acquisition”). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokia’s
repurchase  of  convertible  notes  of  $2.1  billion,  which  was  a  non-cash  transaction,  and  liabilities  assumed  of  $0.2  billion.  The  Acquisition  was
expected to accelerate the growth of our D&C business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing.

The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of March 31, 2015. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have
allocated the purchase price were as follows:

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded $7.5 billion of goodwill and asset impairment charges related to our Phone Hardware
business. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement. See Note 10 –
Goodwill and Note 11 – Intangible Assets for additional details.

Our  consolidated  income  statement  for  fiscal  year  2014  included  revenue  and  operating  loss  of  $2.0  billion  and  $692  million,  respectively,
attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.

Following  are  the  supplemental  consolidated  results  of  Microsoft  Corporation  on  an  unaudited  pro  forma  basis,  as  if  the  Acquisition  had  been
consummated on July 1, 2012:

These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have
been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of
operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of
related  party  transactions  between  Microsoft  and  NDS.  Acquisition  costs  and  other  nonrecurring  charges  incurred  are  included  in  the  earliest
period presented.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition costs
are  primarily  comprised  of  transaction  fees  and  direct  acquisition  costs,  including  legal,  finance,  consulting,  and  other  professional  fees.  These
costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014.

Certain  concurrent  transactions  were  recognized  separately  from  the  Acquisition.  Prior  to  the Acquisition,  we  had  joint  strategic  initiatives  with
Nokia;  this  contractual  relationship  was  terminated  in  conjunction  with  the  Acquisition.  No  gain  or  loss  was  recorded  upon  termination  of  this
agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. In addition, we agreed to license Nokia’s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately
for the services provided under a four-year license as they are rendered.

Yammer

On July 18, 2012, we acquired Yammer, Inc. (“Yammer”), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. Yammer added
an enterprise social networking service to Microsoft’s portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. The major classes of assets to which we
allocated  the  purchase  price  were  goodwill  of  $937  million  and  identifiable  intangible  assets  of  $178  million.  We  assigned  the  goodwill  to
Commercial Other under our current segment structure. Yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date.

these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.

(a) Goodwill acquired during fiscal year 2014 related to the acquisition of NDS. See Note 9 – Business Combinations for additional details.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances
that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a
recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in
the  above  table.  Also  included  in  “Other”  are  business  dispositions  and  transfers  between  business  segments  due  to  reorganizations,  as
applicable.  For  fiscal  year  2015,  a  $5.1  billion  goodwill  impairment  charge  was  included  in  “Other,”  as  discussed  further  below.  This  goodwill
impairment  charge  was  included  in  impairment,  integration,  and  restructuring  expenses  in  our  consolidated  income  statement,  and  reflected  in
Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in Note 22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data.

Our accumulated goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $11.3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.

Goodwill Impairment

PART II
Item 8

We  test  goodwill  for  impairment  annually  on  May  1  at  the  reporting  unit  level,  primarily  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  with  a  peer-
based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair
values of the businesses.

Upon completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, Phone Hardware goodwill was determined to be impaired. In the second half of fiscal
year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These
results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced
future  revenue  and  profitability  expectations  for  the  business.  As  a  result  of  these  changes  in  strategy  and  expectations,  we  have  forecasted
reductions  in  unit  volume  growth  rates  and  lower  future  cash  flows  used  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  the  Phone  Hardware  reporting  unit,  which
resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required.

Because  our  annual  test  indicated  that  Phone  Hardware’s  carrying  value  exceeded  its  estimated  fair  value,  a  second  phase  of  the  goodwill
impairment test (“Step 2”) was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities
were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an
estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the
amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates
used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets.

No other instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015 test. No impairment of goodwill was identified as of May 1, 2014.

The components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:

Technology-based intangible assets included $116 million and $98 million as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of net carrying amount
of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.

We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of
$2.2  billion  related  to  our  Phone  Hardware  intangible  assets.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2015,  we  tested  the  intangible  assets  for
recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for
Phone Hardware. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an
impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income
approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment. These intangible assets impairment charges
were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other
in  our  table  of  operating  income  (loss)  by  segment  group  in  Note  22  –  Segment  Information  and  Geographic  Data.  No  material  impairments  of
intangible assets were identified during fiscal year 2014.

NOTE 12 — DEBT

As  of  June  30,  2015,  we  had  $5.0  billion  of  commercial  paper  issued  and  outstanding,  with  a  weighted-average  interest  rate  of  0.11%  and
maturities ranging from 8 days to 63 days. As of June 30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-
average  interest  rate  of  0.12%  and  maturities  ranging  from  86  to  91  days.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  this  commercial  paper  approximates  its
carrying value.

We have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on November 4, 2015 and November 14, 2018, respectively. These credit facilities serve as a
back-up  for  our  commercial  paper  program.  As  of  June  30,  2015,  we  were  in  compliance  with  the  only  financial  covenant  in  both  credit
agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to
interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented.

Long-term Debt

As of June 30, 2015, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $30.3 billion and
$30.5 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt of $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion,
respectively, as of June 30, 2014. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

PART II
Item 8

The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our
products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2015, this reduction
was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring
charges.  Excluding  these  losses,  our  foreign  earnings,  which  are  taxed  at  rates  lower  than  the  U.S.  rate  and  are  generated  from  our  regional
operating centers, were 73%, 81%, and 79% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In general, other
reconciling  items  consist  of  interest,  U.S.  state  income  taxes,  and  credits.  In  fiscal  years  2015,  2014,  and  2013,  there  were  no  individually
significant other reconciling items.

As  of  June  30,  2015,  we  had  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of  $4.6  billion,  including  $1.8  billion  of  foreign  net  operating  loss  carryforwards
acquired through our acquisition of Skype, and $545 million through our acquisition of NDS. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above
relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other future deductible net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases
and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.

$108.3 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are

permanently  reinvested  outside  the  U.S.  The  unrecognized  deferred  tax  liability  associated  with  these  temporary  differences  was  approximately
$34.5 billion at June 30, 2015.

Income taxes paid were $4.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $3.9 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $9.6 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.6 billion, respectively. If recognized, these
tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, by $7.9 billion, $7.0 billion, and $6.5 billion, respectively.

As  of  June  30,  2015,  2014,  and  2013,  we  had  accrued  interest  expense  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  of  $1.7  billion,  $1.5  billion,  and  $1.3
billion,  respectively,  net  of  federal  income  tax  benefits.  Interest  expense  on  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was  $237  million,  $235  million,  and  $400
million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and was included in income tax expense.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our
income tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In February 2012, the
I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2015, the primary unresolved
issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe
our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not
expect  a  final  resolution  of  these  issues  in  the  next  12  months.  Based  on  the  information  currently  available,  we  do  not  anticipate  a  significant
increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the
I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2015.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax
years  1996  to  2015,  some  of  which  are  currently  under  audit  by  local  tax  authorities.  The  resolutions  of  these  audits  are  not  expected  to  be
material to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 14 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In  July  2014,  we  announced  a  restructuring  plan  to  simplify  our  organization  and  align  NDS  with  our  company’s  overall  strategy  (the  “Phone
Hardware Integration Plan”). Pursuant to the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated approximately 19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015,
including approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions related to the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware
Integration Plan were completed as of June 30, 2015.

Hardware  Restructuring  Plan”),  under  which  we  will  eliminate  up  to  7,800  positions  in  fiscal  year  2016.  In  connection  with  the  Phone  Hardware
Restructuring  Plan,  we  recorded  restructuring  charges  of  $780  million  during  fiscal  year  2015,  including  severance  expenses  and  other
reorganization costs, primarily related to contractual obligations. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan are expected
to be completed as of June 30, 2016.

Restructuring charges associated with each plan were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income
statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in Note 22 — Segment Information and
Geographic Data.

Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

Motorola litigation

NOTE 18 — CONTINGENCIES

In  October  2010,  Microsoft  filed  patent  infringement  complaints  against  Motorola  Mobility  (“Motorola”)  with  the  International  Trade  Commission
(“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by Motorola’s Android devices. Microsoft and Motorola have
filed  additional  claims  against  each  other  with  the  ITC,  in  federal  district  courts  in  Seattle,  Wisconsin,  Florida,  and  California,  and  in  courts  in
Germany. The nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.

International Trade Commission

In 2012, the ITC issued a limited exclusion order against Motorola on one Microsoft patent, which was affirmed on appeal. In 2013, Microsoft filed
an  action  in  U.S.  District  Court  in  Washington,  D.C.  seeking  an  order  to  compel  enforcement  of  the  ITC’s  2012  import  ban  against  infringing
Motorola products by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), after learning that CBP had failed to fully enforce the order.

In 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft with the ITC alleging infringement of five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles and accessories
and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing

84

Table of Contents

PART II
Item 8

Xbox products. At Motorola’s request, the ITC terminated its investigation of four Motorola patents. In 2013, the ITC affirmed there was no violation
of the remaining Motorola patent. Motorola appealed the ITC’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

U.S. District Court

The Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion to Microsoft’s ITC case against Motorola was stayed pending the
outcome of the ITC case.

In  November  2010,  Microsoft  sued  Motorola  for  breach  of  contract  in  U.S.  District  Court  in  Seattle,  alleging  that  Motorola  breached  its
commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (“RAND”) terms and
conditions. Motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the H.264 video standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In the
Motorola ITC case described above and in suits described below, Motorola or a Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in
U.S. District Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In 2012, the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft ruling
that  (1)  Motorola  had  committed  to  standards  organizations  to  license  its  declared-essential  patents  on  RAND  terms  and  conditions;  and
(2) Microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. After trial, the Seattle District Court set per unit royalties for Motorola’s H.264 and
802.11  patents,  which  resulted  in  an  immaterial  Microsoft  liability.  In  2013,  following  trial  of  Microsoft’s  breach  of  contract  claim,  a  jury  awarded
$14.5 million in damages to Microsoft. Motorola appealed with respect to both the Court’s determination of royalties due Motorola and the jury’s
award of damages against Motorola; in July 2015 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court’s judgment in all respects.

Cases  filed  by  Motorola  in  Wisconsin,  California,  and  Florida,  with  the  exception  of  one  case  in  Wisconsin  initially  stayed  and  later  dismissed
without prejudice (a companion case to Motorola’s ITC action), have been transferred to the U.S District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft
both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. The court has stayed these cases in Seattle on agreement of the parties.

  In the transferred cases, Motorola asserts 15 patents are infringed by a range of Microsoft products including mobile and PC operating

system, productivity, server, communication, browser and gaming products.

  In  the  Motorola  action  originally  filed  in  California,  Motorola  asserts  Microsoft  violated  antitrust  laws  in  connection  with  Microsoft’s

assertion of patents against Motorola that Microsoft agreed to license to certain qualifying entities on RAND terms and conditions.

  In counterclaims, Microsoft asserts 14 patents are infringed by Motorola Android devices and certain Motorola digital video recorders.

•

•

•

Germany

In 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries.

•

•

•

•

  Motorola asserts two patents (both now expired) are essential to implementation of the H.264 video standard, and Motorola alleges that
H.264 capable products including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media Player, and Internet Explorer infringe those patents. In 2012, the court
issued  an  injunction  relating  to  all  H.264  capable  Microsoft  products  in  Germany,  which  Microsoft  appealed.  Orders  in  the  litigation
pending in Seattle, Washington described above enjoin Motorola from enforcing the German injunction.

  Motorola  asserts  that  one  patent  covers  certain  syncing  functionality  in  the  ActiveSync  protocol  employed  by  Windows  Phone  7,
Outlook Mobile, Hotmail Mobile, Exchange Online, Exchange Server, and Hotmail Server. In 2013, the court stayed the case pending
the outcome of parallel proceedings in which Microsoft is seeking to invalidate the patent. In 2013, the Federal Patent Court invalidated
the originally issued patent claims, but ruled that certain new amended claims were patentable. Both Motorola and Microsoft appealed.
In June 2014, the court reopened infringement proceedings, which are currently stayed.

  Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact of any injunction by altering its products to avoid Motorola’s infringement claims.

  Any damages would be determined in separate proceedings.

85

Table of Contents

PART II
Item 8

In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in 2011 and 2012, Microsoft asserts that Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft patents and is seeking
damages and injunctions. In 2012, regional courts in Germany issued injunctions on three of the Microsoft patents, which Motorola appealed. One
judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and Motorola has further appealed), and the other two appeals are pending (in one of these two cases the
asserted  patent  has  expired).  An  additional  infringement  proceeding  is  still  pending  in  the  court  of  first  instance.  In  actions  filed  separately  by
Motorola to invalidate these patents, the Federal Patent Court in 2013 and 2014 held the Microsoft patents invalid, and Microsoft appealed. For the
cases in which Microsoft obtained injunctions, if Motorola were to prevail following all appeals, Motorola could have a claim against Microsoft for
damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction.

IPCom patent litigation

IPCom GmbH & Co. (“IPCom”) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent
families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the
leading  cell  phone  companies  and  operators.  In  November  2014,  Microsoft  and  IPCom  entered  into  a  standstill  agreement  staying  all  of  the
pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions.

InterDigital patent litigation

InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, “IDT”) filed four patent infringement cases against
Nokia  in  the  ITC  and  in  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Delaware  between  2007  and  2013.  We  have  been  added  to  these  cases  as  a
defendant. IDT has cases pending against other defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to
3G  and  4G  wireless  communications  standards  essential  functionality.  The  cases  involving  us  include  three  ITC  investigations  where  IDT  is
seeking  an  order  excluding  importation  of  3G  and  4G  phones  into  the  U.S.  and  one  active  case  in  U.S.  District  Court  in  Delaware  seeking  an
injunction and damages. The ITC issued a finding of no violation relating to two of the investigations, which IDT appealed. In February 2015, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed one of the ITC’s findings; the other has been stayed. In the third ITC action the administrative
law judge (“ALJ”) issued a determination finding: (1) infringement; (2) evidence of “reverse hold-up;” and (3) the public interest does not preclude
issuance  of  an  exclusion  order.  The  ITC  is  reviewing  the  ALJ’s  initial  determination.  The  trial  in  the  Delaware  case  is  scheduled  for  November
2015.

European copyright levies

We  assumed  from  Nokia  all  potential  liability  due  to  Nokia’s  alleged  failure  to  pay  “private  copying  levies”  in  various  European  countries  based
upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are based upon a 2001 European Union (“EU”) Directive
establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based
upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries
initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include
blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in
Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. Since April 2015, we and other major
manufacturers  have  been  engaged  in  settlement  negotiations  with  the  German  collecting  society,  with  the  aim  of  concluding  negotiations  by
October 2015.

Other patent and intellectual property claims

In addition to these cases, there are approximately 70 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft.

Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions

PART II
Item 8

A  large  number  of  antitrust  and  unfair  competition  class  action  lawsuits  were  filed  against  us  in  various  state,  federal,  and  Canadian  courts  on
behalf  of  various  classes  of  direct  and  indirect  purchasers  of  our  PC  operating  system  and  certain  other  software  products  between  1999  and
2005.

We  obtained  dismissals  or  reached  settlements  of  all  claims  made  in  the  U.S.  Under  the  settlements,  generally  class  members  can  obtain
vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of
vouchers  that  we  may  issue  varies  by  state.  We  will  make  available  to  certain  schools  a  percentage  of  those  vouchers  that  are  not  issued  or
claimed  (one-half  to  two-thirds  depending  on  the  state).  The  total  value  of  vouchers  we  ultimately  issue  will  depend  on  the  number  of  class
members who make claims and are issued vouchers. We estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $200 million, all of
which had been accrued as of June 30, 2015.

Three similar cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not been settled. In 2010, the court in the British Columbia
case certified it as a class action. After the British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the case, in 2013 the Canadian Supreme Court reversed
the appellate court and reinstated part of the British Columbia case, which is now scheduled for trial in 2016. The other two cases are inactive.

Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims

GO Computer litigation

In  June  2005,  GO  Computer  Inc.  and  co-founder  Jerry  Kaplan  filed  a  complaint  in  California  state  court  asserting  antitrust  claims  under  the
Cartwright Act related to the business of the former GO Corporation in the early 1990s and its successor in interest, Lucent Corporation in the early
2000s. All claims prior to June 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations. The case is moving forward with
discovery, and a trial is set for September 2015.

China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation

In  July  2014,  Microsoft  was  informed  that  China’s  State  Administration  for  Industry  and  Commerce  (“SAIC”)  had  begun  a  formal  investigation
relating  to  China’s  Anti-Monopoly  Law,  and  the  SAIC  conducted  onsite  inspections  of  Microsoft  offices  in  Beijing,  Shanghai,  Guangzhou,  and
Chengdu.  SAIC  has  stated  the  investigation  relates  to  compatibility,  bundle  sales,  and  file  verification  issues  related  to  Windows  and  Office
software.

Product-Related Litigation

U.S. cell phone litigation

Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of
Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects.
We have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS acquisition and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these
cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision,
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within
the  U.S.  Federal  Communications  Commission  radio  frequency  emission  guidelines  (“FCC  Guidelines”)  are  pre-empted  by  federal  law.  The
plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect.
The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.

In September 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed
scientific methodologies. In March 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to

87

Table of Contents

PART II
Item 8

preclude plaintiffs’ general causation testimony. In August 2014, the court granted in part defendants’ motion to exclude plaintiffs’ general causation
experts.  The  plaintiffs  filed  an  interlocutory  appeal.  In  December  2014,  the  District  of  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  agreed  to  hear  en  banc
defendants’  interlocutory  appeal  challenging  the  standard  for  evaluating  expert  scientific  evidence.  Trial  court  proceedings  are  stayed  pending
resolution of the appeal.

Canadian cell phone class action

Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of
British  Columbia  by  a  purported  class  of  Canadians  who  have  used  cellular  phones  for  at  least  1,600  hours,  including  a  subclass  of  users  with
brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet
active as several defendants remain to be served.

Other

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management
currently  believes  that  resolving  claims  against  us,  individually  or  in  aggregate,  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  consolidated
financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2015, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $614 million in other current liabilities and $20 million in other long-term liabilities.
While  we  intend  to  defend  these  matters  vigorously,  adverse  outcomes  that  we  estimate  could  reach  approximately  $1.6  billion  in  aggregate
beyond  recorded  amounts  are  reasonably  possible.  Were  unfavorable  final  outcomes  to  occur,  there  exists  the  possibility  of  a  material  adverse
impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

PART II
Item 8

We have an employee stock purchase plan (the “Plan”) for all eligible employees. Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at
three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase shares having
a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares during the periods
presented:

At June 30, 2015, 157 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the Plan.

Savings Plan

We  have  a  savings  plan  in  the  U.S.  that  qualifies  under  Section  401(k)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  and  a  number  of  savings  plans  in
international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 75% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty
cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant’s earnings
or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the given year. Matching contributions for all plans were $454 million, $420 million, and $393 million in
fiscal  years  2015,  2014,  and  2013,  respectively,  and  were  expensed  as  contributed.  Matching  contributions  in  the  U.S.  plan  are  invested
proportionate to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan
include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock.

NOTE 22 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain
financial  information,  including  segmented  internal  profit  and  loss  statements  prepared  on  a  basis  not  consistent  with  U.S.  GAAP.  The  segment
information  in  this  note  is  reported  on  that  basis.  During  the  periods  presented,  we  reported  our  financial  performance  based  on  the  following
segments; D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other.

On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS. See Note 9 – Business Combinations for additional details. NDS has been included in our
consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware
segment.  Prior  to  the  acquisition  of  NDS,  financial  results  associated  with  our  joint  strategic  initiatives  with  Nokia  were  reflected  in  our  D&C
Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition.

Our reportable segments are described below.

Devices and Consumer

Our  D&C  segments  develop,  manufacture,  market,  and  support  products  and  services  designed  to  entertain  and  connect  people,  increase
personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C
segments are:

•

  D&C Licensing, comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic
volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core
Office  product  set,  for  consumers  (“Office  Consumer”);  Windows  Phone  operating  system,  including  related  patent  licensing;  and
certain other patent licensing revenue.

•

  Computing and Gaming Hardware, comprising: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories, second-party and third-
party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions (“Xbox Platform”); Surface devices and accessories (“Surface”); and Microsoft
PC accessories.

  Phone Hardware, comprising: Lumia phones and other non-Lumia phones, beginning with our acquisition of NDS.

  D&C Other,  comprising:  Resale,  consisting  of  transactions  in  our  Windows  Store  and  Xbox  marketplace;  search  advertising;  display
advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games;
Mojang;  non-Microsoft  products  sold  in  our  retail  stores;  and  certain  other  consumer  products  and  services  not  included  in  the
categories above.

Commercial

Our  Commercial  segments  develop,  market,  and  support  software  and  services  designed  to  increase  individual,  team,  and  organizational
productivity  and  efficiency,  including  simplifying  everyday  tasks  through  seamless  operations  across  the  user’s  hardware  and  software.  Our
Commercial segments are:

•

•

  Commercial Licensing, comprising: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center,
and  related  Client  Access  Licenses  (“CALs”);  Windows  Embedded;  volume  licensing  of  the  Windows  operating  system,  excluding
academic  (“Windows  Commercial”);  Microsoft  Office  for  business,  including  Office,  Exchange,  SharePoint,  Skype  for  Business,  and
related CALs (“Office Commercial”); Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online; and Skype.

  Commercial  Other,  comprising:  Enterprise  Services,  including  Premier  Support  Services  and  Microsoft  Consulting  Services;
Commercial  Cloud,  comprising  Office  365  Commercial,  other  Microsoft  Office  online  offerings,  Dynamics  CRM  Online,  and  Microsoft
Azure; and certain other commercial products and online services not included in the categories above.

Revenue  and  cost  of  revenue  are  generally  directly  attributed  to  our  segments.  Certain  revenue  contracts  are  allocated  among  the  segments
based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold
separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is directly charged to our hardware segments. For the remaining segments,
cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases and allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology.

We  do  not  allocate  operating  expenses  to  our  segments.  Rather,  we  allocate  them  to  our  two  segment  groups,  Devices  and  Consumer  and
Commercial.  Due  to  the  integrated  structure  of  our  business,  allocations  of  expenses  are  made  in  certain  cases  to  incent  cross-collaboration
among  our  segment  groups  so  that  a  segment  group  is  not  solely  burdened  by  the  cost  of  a  mutually  beneficial  activity  as  we  seek  to  deliver
seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

Operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows:

•

•

•

  Sales and marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified customer segment.

  Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross margin but are mapped

directly in certain cases where the value of the expense only accrues to that segment group.

  General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated based on relative gross margin.

Certain  corporate-level  activity  is  not  allocated  to  our  segment  groups,  including  costs  of:  legal,  including  expenses,  settlements,  and  fines;
information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation
Redmond, Washington

PART II
Item 8

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2015
and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three
years in the period ended June 30, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our  opinion,  such  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 30, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  Company’s
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  June  30,  2015,  based  on  the  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework
(2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  July  31,  2015,  expressed  an
unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  we  have
evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as  required  by  Exchange  Act  Rule  13a-15(b)  as  of  the  end  of  the  period
covered  by  this  report.  Based  on  that  evaluation,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  have  concluded  that  these  disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control
over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  our  financial  reporting  for  external  purposes  in
accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  Internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes
maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded  as  necessary  for  preparation  of  our  financial  statements;  providing  reasonable  assurance  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  company
assets  are  made  in  accordance  with  management  authorization;  and  providing  reasonable  assurance  that  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  or
disposition  of  company  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial  statements  would  be  prevented  or  detected  on  a  timely  basis.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our
financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  the  framework  in  Internal
Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this
evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2015. There were no
changes  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  during  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2015  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting
as of June 30, 2015; their report is included in Item 9A.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation
Redmond, Washington

PART II
Item 9A

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2015, based
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Report  of  Management  on  Internal  Control  Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that
a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and
principal  financial  officers,  or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  and  effected  by  the  company’s  board  of  directors,  management,  and  other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being
made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding
prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company’s  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the
financial statements.

Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management
override  of  controls,  material  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud  may  not  be  prevented  or  detected  on  a  timely  basis. Also,  projections  of  any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015, based on
the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2015, of the Company and our report dated July 31, 2015, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements.

MICROSOFT CORPORATION
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
(Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2015)

Exhibit 10.14

1. Purpose

The purpose of the Microsoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “Plan”) is to further the long-term growth of

Microsoft Corporation (the “Company”) by allowing the non-employee directors of the Company the opportunity to defer certain compensation, keeping their
financial interests aligned with the Company, and providing them with a long-term incentive to continue providing services to the Company.

This Plan is intended to comply with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and official guidance issued
thereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, this Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with this
intention.

2. Effective Date

The Plan is effective January 16, 2006. This restatement of the Plan is effective January 1, 2015.

3. Definitions

In addition to the terms defined above, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated below.

Account — means a bookkeeping account established by the Company for each Participant electing to defer Eligible Compensation under the Plan,

which may include sub-accounts for amounts payable at different times and/or payable in different forms.

Affiliate — means any corporation or other entity that is treated as a single employer with the Company under Code section 414.

Board — means the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation.

Cash Retainer — means the amount of annual retainer payable in cash for service on the Board, including any annual retainer payable for service as a

chair or member of any Board committee.

Common Stock — means the Common Stock, $0.00000625 par value, of the Company.

Director — means a member of the Board who is not an officer or employee of the Company or any Affiliate.

Eligible Compensation — means both the Cash Retainer and Equity Retainer. For the avoidance of doubt, Eligible Compensation earned in a Plan Year
refers to the Cash Retainer and Equity Retainer earned in the four quarterly cycles beginning in the applicable Plan Year measured from the date of the annual
shareholders meeting in the immediately prior Plan Year.

Equity Retainer — means the amount of annual retainer payable in Common Stock for service on the Board, including any annual retainer payable for

service as a chair or member of any Board committee.

1

New Director — means a Director who was not eligible to participate in the Plan (or any other plan sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate, which
may be aggregated with the Plan under Code section 409A) prior to becoming a Director; provided, all Directors providing services to the Company as of the
Effective Date shall be deemed to be New Directors for purposes of making an initial election pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii) with respect to Eligible
Compensation earned in 2006.

Open Enrollment — means the period during each Plan Year when Directors may elect to make, terminate or change an initial election to defer amounts

under the Plan. Open Enrollment shall normally be held during the month of December of each Plan Year.

Participant — means a Director who elects to defer Eligible Compensation under the Plan.

Plan Administrator — means the Compensation Committee of the Board, or its delegate or delegates appointed to administer the Plan.

Plan Year — means the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31.

Separation from Service or Separates from Service — means a “separation from service” with the Company and its Affiliates within the meaning of

Code section 409A.

HR Officer — means the senior corporate officer in charge of the Human Resources department, currently the Chief People Officer.

4. Participation

4.1 Any Director shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. A Director becomes a Participant in the Plan on the date he or she first enrolls in the Plan

by electing to defer Eligible Compensation in accordance with Section 5.1(b).

4.2 A Director who has been a Participant under the Plan will cease to be a Participant on the date his or her Account is fully distributed.

5. Participant Accounts

5.1 Elections to Defer Eligible Compensation

(a) Initial Deferral Election. A Director may make an irrevocable election to defer the following types of Eligible Compensation in one

(1) percent increments up to the specified maximum percentages:

(i) A Director may elect to defer up to 100% of his or her Cash Retainer.

(ii) A Director may elect to defer up to 100% of his or her Equity Retainer.

(b) Time and Manner of Making an Initial Election

that occurs in the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the Eligible Compensation is earned.

(i) A Director may make an irrevocable election to defer one or more types of Eligible Compensation during the Open Enrollment period

(ii) In addition to Open Enrollment elections under Section 5.1(b)(i), a New Director may make an irrevocable election to defer one or

more types of Eligible Compensation, provided such election is made within thirty (30) days of becoming a New Director and such election shall only apply
to amounts earned after the election is filed.

2

(iii) A deferral election shall be made in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator.

(c) Evergreen Election. An initial deferral election shall be effective for succeeding Plan Years and shall become irrevocable on each

December 31 with respect to Eligible Compensation earned in the immediately following Plan Year unless the Participant terminates or modifies such
election. A Participant may terminate or modify an initial deferral election during the Open Enrollment period immediately prior to the applicable Plan Year.
Any termination of, or modification to, an initial deferral election shall be made in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator.

5.2 Crediting of Deferrals. Eligible Compensation deferred by a Participant under the Plan shall be credited to the Participant’s Account as soon as

practicable after the amounts would have otherwise been paid to the Participant. Amounts credited to a Participant’s Account shall be deemed immediately
invested in shares of Common Stock (calculated to one one-thousandth of a share). Any dividends which would have been received had such amount actually
been invested in shares of Common Stock will also be credited to the Participant’s Account and deemed immediately invested in additional shares of
Common Stock (calculated to one one-thousandth of a share). Nothing in this Section or otherwise in the Plan, however, will require the Company to actually
invest any amounts credited to a Participant’s Account in shares of Common Stock or otherwise.

5.3 Vesting. A Participant shall at all times be one-hundred (100) percent vested in any amounts credited to his or her Account.

5.4 Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization. If any change is made to the shares of Common Stock without the Company’s receipt of

consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the number and/or class of securities credited to a Participant’s Account under the Plan in the same
manner and to the same extent that adjustments are made to the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Company’s 1999 Stock Plan
for Non-Employee Directors.

6. Distribution of Account Balances

6.1 Distribution Form

(a) In the event a Participant elects to have the distribution of a deferred amount (and dividends thereon) commence thirty (30) days following

the date of his or her Separation from Service pursuant to Section 6.2, the Participant may elect to have the deferred amount (and dividends thereon)
distributed in a lump sum payment or in equal annual installments over a period of five (5) years. Such election must be made at the time of making the initial
deferral election under Section 5.1.

(b) In the event a Participant fails to specify the form in which a deferred amount (and dividends thereon) will be distributed at the time of

making an initial deferral election under Section 5.1, or if a Participant elects to receive a distribution other than pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(i), the Participant
shall receive such deferred amount (and dividends thereon) in a lump sum payment.

(c) Distribution of a Participant’s Account balance shall be made in Common Stock; provided, however, any fractional shares of Common Stock

credited to the Account shall be paid in cash.

6.2 Distribution Time

(a) A Participant may elect to have the distribution of a deferred amount (and dividends thereon) commence thirty (30) days following: (i) the

date of the Participant’s Separation from Service; (ii) the first, second, third, fourth or fifth anniversary of the Participant’s Separation from Service; or (iii) a
specified date or, if earlier, the fifth anniversary of the Participant’s Separation from Service (provided that the specified date must be at least twelve
(12) months after the date on which the final payment of the deferred amount would have been made to the Participant absent deferral).

3

(b) A Participant must elect the date on which distributions will commence at the time of making the initial deferral election under Section 5.1. In
the event a Participant fails to elect the date on which a distribution will commence at the time of making an initial deferral election under Section 5.1, or if a
Participant specifies a date under Section 6.2(a)(iii) that is less than twelve (12) months after the date on which the final payment of the deferred amount
would have been made to the Participant absent deferral, the Participant shall receive the distribution thirty (30) days following the date of the Participant’s
Separation from Service.

(c) Except as otherwise permitted under IRS guidance, if a distribution is to be made upon the Separation from Service of a Key Employee,

distribution may not be made before the date which is six months after the date of the Key Employee’s Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of death
of the Key Employee). Any payments that would otherwise be made during this period of delay shall be paid in the seventh month following Separation from
Service (or, if earlier, the month after the Key Employee’s death). For this purpose, “Key Employee” means an individual treated as a “specified employee”
under Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) as of his or her Separation from Service (i.e., a key employee (as defined under Code section 416(i) without regard to
paragraph (5) thereof) of a corporation any stock of which is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise). Key Employees shall be
determined in accordance with Code section 409A, using a December 31 identification date. A listing of Key Employees as of an identification date shall be
effective for the 12-month period beginning on the April 1 following the identification date.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.1 or 6.2 or any election to the contrary, for purposes of Eligible Compensation earned during each separate

quarterly period beginning after 2014, if a Participant Separates from Service during a separate quarterly period, the distribution of any deferred amount (and
dividends thereon) attributable to such period will be paid in a cash lump sum within 30 days following the last day of the quarterly period, subject to
Section 6.2(c) and in accordance with Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(c).

6.3 Distributions upon Death

(a) In the event a Participant dies prior to the distribution of his or her entire Account balance, the remaining Account balance shall be distributed

to the Participant’s beneficiary in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above.

(b) A Participant shall designate his or her beneficiary prior to death in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator. If a

Participant has not properly designated a beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary is living on the date of any distribution, such amount shall be distributed
to the Participant’s estate.

(c) For purposes of determining the proper death beneficiary under this Plan, this Plan shall not be interpreted as preempting applicable state law

regarding the ownership rights of Accounts upon a Participant’s death. For example, although this Plan states that upon a Participant’s death, Account
balances will be paid to his or her beneficiary, the personal representative will be obligated to pay any benefits owed to a spouse or otherwise as a result of
any applicable community property laws.

7. Administration

The Plan Administrator shall be responsible for the operation and administration of the Plan and for carrying out the provisions hereof. The Plan
Administrator shall have the full authority and discretion to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of
this Plan and decide or resolve any and all questions, including interpretations of this Plan, as may arise in connection with this Plan. Any such action taken
by the Plan Administrator shall be final and conclusive on any party. To the extent the Plan Administrator has been granted discretionary authority under the
Plan, the Plan Administrator’s prior exercise of such authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like fashion thereafter. The Plan Administrator
shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon all tables,

4

valuations, certificates, opinions and reports furnished by any actuary, accountant, controller, counsel or other person employed or engaged by the Company
with respect to the Plan. The Plan Administrator may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to such agents, including the HR Officer or other
employees of the Company, such administrative duties as it sees fit, and the HR Officer is expressly delegated the authority to take all actions necessary to
implement the Plan in accordance with the terms approved by the Board and the Plan Administrator.

8. Amendment and Termination

8.1 Amendment or Termination. The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan when, in the sole discretion of the Company, such
amendment or termination is advisable, pursuant to a resolution or other action taken by the Board or the Plan Administrator, provided that the Board or Plan
Administrator may delegate the authority to amend the Plan to the HR Officer from time to time.

8.2 Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment or termination of the Plan shall decrease the amounts credited to a Participant’s Account as of

such amendment or termination. Upon termination of the Plan, Participants’ Account balances shall be distributed in accordance with Sections 6.1 through
6.3, unless the Company determines in its sole discretion that all such amounts shall be distributed upon termination in accordance with the requirements
under Code section 409A.

8.3 Constructive Receipt Termination. If amounts deferred under the Plan must be included in income under Code section 409A prior to the scheduled

distribution of such amounts, distribution of such amount shall be made to Participants.

9. General Provisions

9.1 Rights Unsecured. The right of a Participant or his or her beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder shall be an unsecured claim against the
general assets of the Company, and neither the Participant nor his or her beneficiary shall have any rights in or against any amount credited to any Account or
any other specific assets of the Company. The Plan at all times shall be considered entirely unfunded for tax purposes. Any funds set aside by the Company
for the purpose of meeting its obligations under the Plan, including any amounts held by a trustee, shall continue for all purposes to be part of the general
assets of the Company and shall be available to its general creditors in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy or insolvency. The Company’s obligation under
this Plan shall be that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.

9.2 Construction of Plan. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to give any Director any right to receive Eligible Compensation or any other type of

compensation. No Participant or beneficiary shall have any right to receive a distribution under the Plan except in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Establishment of the Plan shall not be construed to give any Participant the right to be retained as a member of the Board. Nothing contained in the Plan shall
constitute a guarantee by the Company or any other person or entity that the assets of the Company will be sufficient to pay any benefits hereunder. In the
event any provision of the Plan shall be held invalid or illegal for any reason, any illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, but
the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted. Words in the masculine gender shall include the
feminine and the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa, unless qualified by the context. Any headings used herein are included for ease of reference
only, and are not to be construed so as to alter the terms hereof.

9.3 Nonalienation of Benefits. This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon the parties hereto and their successors, heirs and assigns; provided,

however, that the amounts credited to a Participant’s Account are not, except as provided in Section 9.4, subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation,
sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to
anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to any benefits payable hereunder, will be null and void
and not binding on the Plan or the Company.

5

9.4 Taxes. The Company or other payor may withhold from a benefit payment under the Plan or a Participant’s Eligible Compensation any federal,
state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to a payment or accrual under the Plan, and shall report such payments and other Plan-related
information to the appropriate governmental agencies as required under applicable law.

9.5 Delivery of Shares. The obligation of the Company to issue shares of Common Stock under this Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules

and regulations, including all applicable federal and state securities laws, and the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed
necessary or appropriate by the Plan Administrator.

9.6 Participant’s Cooperation. The Participant shall cooperate with the Company by furnishing any and all information requested by the Plan

Administrator in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder. If the Participant refuses to cooperate, the Company shall have no further obligation to
the Participant under the Plan.

9.7 Incapacity of Recipient. If any person entitled to a distribution under the Plan is deemed by the Plan Administrator to be incapable of personally

receiving and giving a valid receipt for such payment, then, unless and until a claim for such payment shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian or
other legal representative of such person, the Plan Administrator may provide for such payment or any part thereof to be made to any other person or
institution then contributing toward or providing for the care and maintenance of such person. Any such payment shall be a payment for the account of such
person and a complete discharge of any liability of the Company and the Plan with respect to the payment.

9.8 Legally Binding. In the event of any consolidation, merger, acquisition or reorganization, the obligations of the Company under this Plan shall
continue and be binding on the Company and its successors or assigns. The rights, privileges, benefits and obligations under the Plan are intended to be legal
obligations of the Company and binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns.

9.9 Unclaimed Benefits. Each Participant shall keep the Plan Administrator informed of his or her current address and the current address of his or her

designated beneficiary. The Plan Administrator shall not be obligated to search for the whereabouts of any person if the location of a person is not made
known to the Plan Administrator.

9.10 Applicable Law and Venue. The Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington. In the event the Company or any Participant (or

beneficiary) initiates litigation related to this Plan, the venue for such action will be in King County, Washington.

9.11 Waiver of Breach. The waiver by the Company of any breach of any provision of the Plan by a Participant shall not operate or be construed as a

waiver of any subsequent breach by the Participant.

9.12 Notice. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Plan Administrator under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-
delivered, or sent by first class mail to the principal office of the Company, directed to the attention of the Plan Administrator. Such notice shall be deemed
given as of the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark.

9.13 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. In the event that a dispute regarding benefits arises between the Company or Plan Administrator and a Participant (or
beneficiary) and such dispute is resolved through arbitration or litigation in court, the prevailing party(ies) shall be entitled to their reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs incurred in such action.

EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN

(Section 162(m) Performance-Based Awards)

STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT UNDER
THE MICROSOFT CORPORATION 2001 STOCK PLAN

Award Number <<GrantIdentifier>>

This Award Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of an award (the “Award”) of performance-based Stock Awards (“SAs”) awarded to
<<FullName>> (“Awardee”) by Microsoft Corporation (the “Company”) in the exercise of its sole discretion under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock
Plan (the “Plan”) and pursuant to the Microsoft Corporation Executive Officer Incentive Plan (the “EOIP”) on <<GrantDate>> (the “Award Date”).
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Award Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.

1. Award.

(a) The number of SAs initially subject to the Award (the “GrantedSAs”) is <<Granted SAs>>. The performance period of the Award (the “Performance
Period”) is the Company’s <<Year>> fiscal year. At the end of the Performance Period, the Committee (as that term is defined in Section 2(f) of the Plan)
will determine the number of SAs earned under the Award as set forth in Section 2 (these earned SAs are the “Earned SAs”).

(b) The Earned SAs represent the Company’s unfunded and unsecured promise to issue Common Shares at a future date, subject to the terms of this Award
Agreement and the Plan. Awardee has no rights under the Earned SAs other than the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.

2. Performance Goal; Earned SAs.

(a) Not later than 90 days after the beginning of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine the performance goal (the “Performance Goal”) for
the Performance Period under the EOIP, which shall apply to this Award and shall be set forth in Schedule A.

(b) Within a reasonable time after the close of the Performance Period, and in no event later than 90 days following the close of the Performance Period, the
Committee shall determine whether the Performance Goal has been met and, if applicable, certify in accordance with the requirements of Code
Section 162(m) to its satisfaction. The date the Committee makes this determination is the “Determination Date”. If the Performance Goal has not been met,
the number of Earned SAs will be zero. If the Performance Goal has been met, the number of Earned SAs will be determined by the Committee in accordance
with Schedule A.

3. Vesting of SAs.

(a) Subject to the terms of this Award Agreement and the Plan and provided that Awardee remains continuously employed through the vesting dates set out
below, the Earned SAs shall vest as follows:

Vesting Date
[Insert six-month anniversary of last business day in August preceding the Award Date] (“Initial Vest Date”)
Each 6 month anniversary of the Initial Vest Date

Vesting will not occur before the first NASDAQ Stock Market regular trading day that is on or after the applicable vesting date.

Percentage
of Earned
SAs

12.5%
12.5%

(b) Awardee agrees that the SAs subject to this Award Agreement, and other incentive or performance-based compensation Awardee receives or has received
from the Company, shall be subject to the Company’s executive compensation recovery policy, as amended from time to time.

(c) AWARDEE’S RIGHTS IN THE SAs SHALL BE AFFECTED, WITH REGARD TO BOTH VESTING SCHEDULE AND TERMINATION, BY
LEAVES OF ABSENCE, CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED, PARTIAL DISABILITY, AND OTHER CHANGES IN AWARDEE’S
EMPLOYMENT STATUS AS PROVIDED IN THE COMPANY’S CURRENT POLICIES FOR THESE MATTERS. ACCOMPANYING THIS AWARD
AGREEMENT IS A CURRENT COPY OF THESE POLICIES. THESE POLICIES MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT NOTICE IN THE
COMPANY’S SOLE DISCRETION, AND AWARDEE’S RIGHTS WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE POLICIES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF ANY
EMPLOYMENT STATUS CHANGE. E-MAIL “BENEFITS” FOR A COPY OF THE MOST CURRENT POLICIES.

4. Termination. Unless terminated earlier under Section 5, 6 or 7 below, an Awardee’s rights under this Award Agreement with respect to the SAs under this
Award Agreement shall terminate at the time the SAs are converted into Common Shares and distributed to Awardee.

5. Termination of Awardee’s Status as a Participant. Except as otherwise specified in Section 6, 7 and 8 below, in the event of termination of Awardee’s
Continuous Status as a Participant (as that term is defined in Section 2(j) of the Plan), Awardee’s rights under this Award Agreement in any unvested SAs
shall terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, an Awardee’s Continuous Status as a Participant terminates at the time Awardee’s actual employer ceases to be
the Company or a “Subsidiary” of the Company, as that term is defined in Section 2(y) of the Plan, and except as otherwise specified in Section 6, 7 and 8
below, no person shall have any rights as an Awardee under this Award Agreement unless he or she is in Continuous Status as a Participant on the Award
Date.

6. Disability of Awardee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, in the event of termination of Awardee’s Continuous Status as a Participant as a
result of total and permanent disability (as that term is defined in Section 12(c) of the Plan), outstanding unvested Earned SAs shall become immediately
vested.

7. Death of Awardee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, if Awardee is, at the time of death, in Continuous Status as a Participant, outstanding
unvested Earned SAs shall become immediately vested.

8. Retirement of Awardee; Severance.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, in the event of Awardee’s Retirement, Awardee shall be treated as continuously employed through the
vesting dates in Section 3(a) above. For this purpose, “Retirement” means termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary after the earlier of
(a) age 65, or (b) attaining age 55 and 15 years of Continuous Service, provided that immediately prior to termination of employment Awardee is employed
by Microsoft (or a Subsidiary) in the United States.

This Section 8 will only apply to a Retirement if (a) the Retirement occurs more than one year after the Award Date, (b) Awardee executes a release in
conjunction with the Retirement in the form provided by the Company, and (c) Awardee’s employment does not terminate due to misconduct (as determined
in the sole discretion of the Company’s senior corporate officer in charge of the Human Resources department), including but not limited to misconduct in
violation of Company policy and misconduct that adversely affects the Company’s interests or reputation.

For purposes of this Section 8, “Continuous Service” means that Awardee has continuously remained an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, measured
from Awardee’s “most recent hire date” as reflected in the Company records. For an Awardee who became an employee of the Company following the
acquisition of his or her employer by the Company or a Subsidiary, service with the acquired employer shall count toward Continuous Service, and
Continuous Service shall be measured from Awardee’s acquired company hire date as reflected in the Company’s records.

If the Awardee dies after an eligible Retirement under this Section 8, then any shares that would, but for the Awardee’s death, be distributed pursuant to this
Section 8 on vesting dates that follow the Awardee’s death shall be immediately vested and distributed in accordance with this Award Agreement.

(b) Awardee may vest in shares following Awardee’s termination of employment to the extent provided in a Company severance benefit plan, including the
Senior Executive Severance Benefit Plan. In no event, however, shall any accelerated or continued vesting under a Company severance benefit plan change
the time of payment specified under this Award Agreement.

9. Value of Unvested SAs. In consideration of the award of these SAs, Awardee agrees that upon and following termination of Awardee’s Continuous Status
as a Participant for any reason (whether or not in breach of applicable laws), and regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause, notice,
or pre-termination procedure or whether Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that Awardee’s employment was terminable only for cause or only with notice
or pre-termination procedure, any unvested SAs under this Award Agreement shall be deemed to have a value of zero dollars ($0.00).

10. Conversion of SAs to Common Shares; Responsibility for Taxes.

(a) Provided Awardee has satisfied the requirements of Section 10(b) below, on the vesting of any Earned SAs, the vested Earned SAs shall be converted into
an equivalent number of Common Shares that will be distributed to Awardee (or Awardee’s legal representative, if applicable) within 90 days after the date of
the vesting event (but in no event prior to the Determination Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if accelerated vesting of an SA occurs pursuant to a
provision of the Plan not addressed in this Award Agreement, distribution of the related Common Share shall not occur until the date distribution would have
occurred under this Award Agreement absent this accelerated vesting. The distribution to Awardee (Awardee’s legal representative, if applicable) of Common
Shares in respect of the vested Earned SAs shall be evidenced by means that the Company determines to be appropriate. In the event ownership or issuance of
Common Shares is not feasible due to applicable exchange controls, securities regulations, tax laws or other provisions of applicable law, as determined by
the Company in its sole discretion, Awardee (Awardee’s legal representative, if applicable) shall receive cash proceeds in an amount equal to the value of the
Common Shares otherwise distributable to Awardee, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, net of amounts withheld in satisfaction of the
requirements of Section 10(b) below.

(b) Regardless of any action the Company or Awardee’s actual employer takes with respect to any or all income tax (including federal, state and local taxes),
social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account, or other tax-related withholding items (“Tax-Related Items”) that arise in connection with the SAs,
Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for any Tax-Related Items determined by the Company in its discretion to be legally due by
Awardee, is and remains Awardee’s responsibility. Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the Company and/or Awardee’s actual employer (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the SAs, including the grant of the SAs, the
vesting of Earned SAs, the conversion of Earned SAs into Common Shares or the receipt of an equivalent cash payment, the subsequent sale of any Common
Shares acquired and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the
SAs to reduce or eliminate Awardee’s liability for any Tax-Related Items.

Prior to the relevant taxable or tax-withholding event, as applicable, Awardee shall pay, or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company or to
Awardee’s actual employer (in their sole discretion) to satisfy all obligations for Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Awardee authorizes the Company or
Awardee’s actual employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items from Awardee’s wages or other cash compensation payable to Awardee by the
Company or Awardee’s actual employer. Alternatively, or in addition, the Company or Awardee’s actual employer may, in their sole discretion, and without
notice to or authorization by Awardee, (i) sell or arrange for the sale of Common Shares to be issued upon the vesting of Earned SAs or other event to satisfy
the withholding obligation, and/or (ii) withhold in Common Shares, provided that the Company and Awardee’s actual employer shall withhold only the
amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount or such other amount determined by the Company as not resulting in negative
accounting consequences for the Company. Awardee will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Common Shares subject to the Earned SAs,
notwithstanding that a number of whole vested Common Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. Awardee shall pay to
the Company or to Awardee’s actual employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or Awardee’s actual employer may be required to withhold
as a result of Awardee’s receipt of SAs, the vesting of Earned SAs, or the conversion of vested Earned SAs to Common Shares that cannot be satisfied by the
means described in this paragraph. Except where applicable legal or regulatory provisions prohibit and notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary,
the standard process for the payment of an Awardee’s Tax-Related Items shall be for the Company or Awardee’s actual employer to withhold in Common
Shares only to the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount or such other amount determined by the Company as not resulting
in negative accounting consequences for the Company. The Company may refuse to deliver Common Shares to Awardee if Awardee fails to comply with
Awardee’s obligation in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section 10.

(c) In lieu of issuing fractional Common Shares, on the vesting of a fraction of an Earned SA, the Company shall round the shares down to the nearest whole
share and any such share that represents a fraction of a SA will be included in a subsequent vest date.

(d) Until the distribution to Awardee of the Common Shares in respect of the vested Earned SAs is evidenced by deposit in Awardee’s brokerage account,
Awardee shall have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Common Shares, notwithstanding the
vesting of Earned SAs. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date Awardee is recorded as the
owner of the Common Shares, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.

(e) By accepting the Award of SAs evidenced by this Award Agreement, Awardee agrees not to sell any of the Common Shares received on account of vested
Earned SAs at a time when applicable laws or Company policies prohibit a sale. This restriction shall apply so long as Awardee is an Employee, Consultant or
outside director of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.

11. Non-Transferability of SAs. Awardee’s right in the SAs awarded under this Award Agreement and any interest therein may not be sold, pledged, assigned,
hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner, other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. SAs shall not be subject to execution,
attachment or other process.

12. Acknowledgment of Nature of Plan and SAs. In accepting the Award, Awardee acknowledges that:

(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company
at any time, as provided in the Plan;

(b) the Award of SAs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of SAs or other awards, or
benefits in lieu of SAs even if SAs have been awarded repeatedly in the past;

(c) all decisions with respect to SAs or other future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;

(d) Awardee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary;

(e) the future value of the underlying Common Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;

(f) if Awardee receives Common Shares, the value of the Common Shares acquired on vesting of Earned SAs may increase or decrease in value;

(g) notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the Plan to the contrary and consistent with Section 5 above, in the event of termination of Awardee’s
Continuous Status as a Participant under circumstances where Section 8 above does not apply (whether or not in breach of applicable laws), Awardee’s right
to receive SAs and vest under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Awardee is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by
any notice period mandated under applicable law. Awardee’s right to receive Common Shares pursuant to any Earned SAs after termination of Continuous
Status as a Participant, if any, will be calculated as of the date of termination of Awardee’s active employment and will not be extended by any notice period
mandated under applicable law. The senior corporate officer in charge of the Human Resources department shall have the exclusive discretion to determine
when Awardee is no longer actively employed for purposes of the award of SAs; and

(h) Awardee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause, notice or pre-termination procedure or
whether Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that Awardee’s employment was terminable only for cause or only with notice or pre-termination procedure,
Awardee has no right to, and will not bring any legal claim or action for, (a) any damages for any portion of any Earned SAs that have been vested and
converted into Common Shares, or (b) termination of any unvested SAs under this Award Agreement.

13. No Employment Right. Awardee acknowledges that neither the fact of this Award of SAs nor any provision of this Award Agreement or the Plan or the
policies adopted pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon Awardee any right with respect to employment or continuation of current employment with the
Company or with Awardee’s actual employer, or to employment that is not terminable at will. Awardee further acknowledges and agrees that neither the Plan
nor this Award of SAs makes Awardee’s employment with the Company or Awardee’s actual employer for any minimum or fixed period, and that this
employment is subject to the mutual consent of Awardee and the Company or Awardee’s actual employer, and may be terminated by either Awardee or the
Company or Awardee’s actual employer at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without cause or notice or any kind of pre- or post-termination
warning, discipline or procedure.

14. Administration. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the authority to manage and control the operation and administration of this Award
Agreement shall be vested in the Committee, and the Committee shall have all powers and discretion with respect to this Award Agreement as it has with
respect to the Plan. Any interpretation of the Award Agreement by the Committee and any decision made

by the Committee with respect to the Award Agreement shall be final and binding on all parties. References to the Committee in this Award Agreement shall
be read to include a reference to any delegate of the Committee acting within the scope of his or her delegation.

15. Plan Governs. Except as provided in Schedule A, this Award Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Plan and the EOIP, and this Award Agreement
is subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations promulgated by the Committee from time to time pursuant to the Plan and the EOIP.

16. Notices. Any written notices provided for in this Award Agreement that are sent by mail shall be deemed received three business days after mailing, but
not later than the date of actual receipt. Notices shall be directed, if to Awardee, at Awardee’s address indicated by the Company’s records and, if to the
Company, at the Company’s principal executive office.

17. Electronic Delivery. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to SAs awarded under the Plan or future SAs that
may be awarded under the Plan by electronic means or request Awardee’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. Awardee hereby consents to
receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the
Company or another third party designated by the Company.

18. Acknowledgment. By Awardee’s acceptance of this Award Agreement in the manner prescribed by the Company, Awardee acknowledges that Awardee
has received and has read, understood and accepted all the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Award Agreement, the Plan, and the current policies
referenced in Sections 3(b) and 3(c) above. Awardee understands and agrees that this Award Agreement is subject to all the terms, conditions, and restrictions
stated in this Award Agreement and in the other documents referenced in the preceding sentence, as the latter may be amended from time to time in the
Company’s sole discretion.

19. Board Approval. These SAs have been awarded pursuant to the Plan and this Award of SAs has been approved by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors or the Board of Directors.

20. Governing Law and Venue. This Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without regard to Washington laws
that might cause other law to govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law. The venue for any litigation related to this Award Agreement will be in
King County, Washington.

21. Severability. If one or more of the provisions of this Award Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall
be deemed null and void; however, to the extent permissible by law, any provisions that could be deemed null and void shall first be construed, interpreted or
revised retroactively to permit this Award Agreement to be construed so as to foster the intent of this Award Agreement and the Plan.

22. Complete Award Agreement and Amendment. This Award Agreement (including the policies referenced in Sections 3(b) and 3(c)) and the Plan constitute
the entire agreement between Awardee and the Company regarding SAs. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning these SAs are
superseded. This Award Agreement may be amended only by written agreement of Awardee and the Company, without consent of any other person, provided
that no consent is necessary to an amendment that in the reasonable judgment of the Committee confers a benefit on Awardee. Awardee agrees not to rely on
any oral information regarding this Award of SAs or any written materials not identified in this Section 22.

23. Code Section 409A. This Award Agreement shall be interpreted, operated, and administered in a manner so as not to subject Awardee to the assessment of
additional taxes or interest under Code section 409A, and this Award Agreement shall be amended as the Company, in its sole discretion, determines is
necessary and appropriate to avoid the application of any such taxes or interest.

24. Code Section 162(m). The Award is intended to satisfy the applicable requirements for the performance-based compensation exception under Code
section 162(m) and applicable IRS guidance issued thereunder, and it is intended that the Award be interpreted, operated and administered to meet such
requirements.

Determination of Earned SAs

1.

2.

The Performance Goal for the Award established pursuant to the EOIP is that the Company have positive operating income for the Performance Period,
as reported in the Company’s financial statements (“Operating Income”).

The number of Earned SAs will be the lesser of (a) the Granted SAs and (b) the number obtained by dividing (i) the amount of Awardee’s “Individual
Award Limit” established under the EOIP for the Performance Period by (ii) the closing price of the Company’s Common Shares on the NASDAQ
Stock Market on the Determination Date, then rounding down to the nearest whole share.

The “Individual Award Limit” is the lesser of (a) Awardee’s percentage of the Aggregate Award Limit established under the EOIP for the Performance
Period, and (b) the maximum amount specified in Section 4.1(c) of the EOIP.

Notwithstanding the terms of the EOIP and the Plan, the Committee shall not have discretion to reduce the number of Earned SAs for a Performance
Period.

(a) The performance goal for the Performance Period is that the Company have positive operating income for the Performance Period, as reported in the
Company’s financial statements (the “Performance Goal”).

(b) Within 90 days following the close of the Performance Period, the Committee shall assess performance against the Performance Goal in accordance with
Section 4.2 of the EOIP. If the Performance Goal for the Performance Period is achieved, the Committee also shall determine the number of Earned PSAs
pursuant to Appendix A; provided that in no event may the number of Earned PSAs exceed the maximum amount specified in Section 1(a) or in Section 4.1
of the EOIP. If the Performance Goal for the Performance Period is not achieved, the number of Earned PSAs shall be zero. The date the Committee makes
the determination of the number of Earned PSAs is the “Determination Date” for the Performance Period.

3. Vesting of PSAs.

(a) Earned PSAs shall vest on the first NASDAQ Stock Market regular trading day that is on or after the Determination Date, subject to the terms of this
Award Agreement and the Plan and provided that Awardee remains continuously employed through the last day of the Performance Period.

(b) Awardee agrees that the PSAs subject to this Award Agreement, and other incentive or performance-based compensation Awardee receives or has received
from the Company, shall be subject to the Company’s executive compensation recovery policy, as amended from time to time.

4. Termination. Unless terminated earlier under Section 5, 6 or 7 below, an Awardee’s rights under this Award Agreement with respect to the PSAs under this
Award Agreement shall terminate at the time the PSAs are converted into Common Shares and distributed to Awardee.

5. Termination of Awardee’s Status as a Participant. Except as otherwise specified in Section 6 or 7 below, in the event of termination of Awardee’s
Continuous Status as a Participant (as that term is defined in Section 2(j) of the Plan), Awardee’s rights under this Award Agreement in any unvested PSAs
shall terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, an Awardee’s Continuous Status as a Participant terminates at the time Awardee’s actual employer ceases to be
the Company or a “Subsidiary” of the Company, as that term is defined in Section 2(y) of the Plan, and except as otherwise specified in Section 6 or 7 below,
no person shall have any rights as an Awardee under this Award Agreement unless he or she is in Continuous Status as a Participant on the Award Date.

6. Disability or Death of Awardee.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, in the event of termination of Awardee’s Continuous Status as a Participant as a result of total and
permanent disability (as that term is defined in Section 12(c) of the Plan) before the end of the Performance Period, the Awardee shall become immediately
vested in the Target Award.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, if at the time of Awardee’s death before the end of the Performance Period he or she is in Continuous
Status as a Participant (including pursuant to Section 7(a) below), the Awardee shall become immediately vested in the Target Award. If Awardee vests in the
Target Award pursuant to Section 6(b), then no vesting shall occur pursuant to the Retirement vesting provisions of Section 7(a).

7. Retirement of Awardee; Severance.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 above, in the event of Awardee’s Retirement, Awardee shall be treated as continuously employed through the
vesting date in Section 3(a) above; provided that any Earned PSAs shall be prorated, so that the number of PSAs that vest shall be calculated by multiplying
the number of Earned PSAs by (i) the number of calendar months in which Awardee was in Continuous Service (including partial months) from the beginning
of the Performance Period and the date of Awardee’s Retirement, divided by (ii) the number of calendar months (including partial months) in the Performance
Period. For this purpose, “Retirement” means termination of employment with the Company or a Subsidiary after the earlier of (a) age 65, or (b) attaining age
55 and 15 years of Continuous Service, provided that immediately prior to termination of employment Awardee is employed by Microsoft (or a Subsidiary) in
the United States.

This Section 7 will only apply to a Retirement if (i) the Retirement occurs more than one year after the beginning of the Performance Period, (ii) Awardee
executes a release in conjunction with the Retirement in the form provided by the Company, and (iii) Awardee’s employment does not terminate due to
misconduct (as determined in the sole discretion of the Company’s senior corporate officer in charge of the Human Resources department), including but not
limited to misconduct in violation of Company policy and misconduct that adversely affects the Company’s interests or reputation.

For purposes of this Section 7, “Continuous Service” means that Awardee has continuously remained an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, measured
from Awardee’s “most recent hire date” as reflected

in the Company records. For an Awardee who became an employee of the Company following the acquisition of his or her employer by the Company or a
Subsidiary, service with the acquired employer shall count toward Continuous Service, and Continuous Service shall be measured from Awardee’s acquired
company hire date as reflected in the Company’s records.

If the Awardee dies after an eligible Retirement under this Section 7, then any Common Shares that would, but for the Awardee’s death, be distributed
pursuant to this Section 7 on the vesting date that follows the Awardee’s death shall be vested and distributed after such vesting date in accordance with this
Award Agreement.

(b) Awardee may vest in PSAs following Awardee’s termination of employment to the extent provided in a Company severance benefit plan, including the
Senior Executive Severance Benefit Plan. In no event, however, shall any accelerated or continued vesting under a Company severance benefit plan change
the time of payment specified under this Award Agreement.

8. Value of Unvested PSAs. In consideration of the award of these PSAs, Awardee agrees that upon and following termination of Awardee’s Continuous
Status as a Participant for any reason (whether or not in breach of applicable laws), and regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause,
notice, or pre-termination procedure or whether Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that Awardee’s employment was terminable only for cause or only
with notice or pre-termination procedure, any unvested PSAs under this Award Agreement shall be deemed to have a value of zero dollars ($0.00).

9. Conversion of PSAs to Common Shares; Responsibility for Taxes.

(a) Provided Awardee has satisfied the requirements of Section 9(b) below, on the vesting of any Earned PSAs, the vested Earned PSAs shall be converted
into an equivalent number of Common Shares that will be distributed to Awardee (or Awardee’s legal representative, if applicable) within 60 days after the
date of the vesting event (but in no event prior to the Determination Date, except in the event of accelerated vesting under Section 6 above). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if accelerated vesting of a PSA occurs pursuant to a provision of the Plan not addressed in this Award Agreement, to the extent required by
Code section 409A, distribution of the related Common Share shall not occur until the date distribution would have occurred under this Award Agreement
absent this accelerated vesting. The distribution to Awardee (or Awardee’s legal representative, if applicable) of Common Shares in respect of the vested
Earned PSAs shall be evidenced by means that the Company determines to be appropriate. In the event ownership or issuance of Common Shares is not
feasible due to applicable exchange controls, securities regulations, tax laws or other provisions of applicable law, as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion, Awardee (or Awardee’s legal representative, if applicable) shall receive cash proceeds in an amount equal to the value of the Common Shares
otherwise distributable to Awardee, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, net of amounts withheld in satisfaction of the requirements of
Section 9(b) below.

(b) Regardless of any action the Company or Awardee’s actual employer takes with respect to any or all income tax (including federal, state and local taxes),
social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account, or other tax-related withholding items (“Tax-Related Items”) that arise in connection with the PSAs,
Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for any Tax-Related Items determined by the Company in its discretion to be legally due by
Awardee, is and remains Awardee’s responsibility. Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the Company and/or Awardee’s actual employer (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the PSAs, including the grant of the PSAs,
the vesting of Earned PSAs, the conversion of Earned PSAs into Common Shares or the receipt of an equivalent cash payment, the subsequent sale of

any Common Shares acquired and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any
aspect of the PSAs to reduce or eliminate Awardee’s liability for any Tax-Related Items.

Prior to the relevant taxable or tax-withholding event, as applicable, Awardee shall pay, or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company or to
Awardee’s actual employer (in their sole discretion) to satisfy all obligations for Tax-Related Items. In this regard, Awardee authorizes the Company or
Awardee’s actual employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items from Awardee’s wages or other cash compensation payable to Awardee by the
Company or Awardee’s actual employer. Alternatively, or in addition, the Company or Awardee’s actual employer may, in their sole discretion, and without
notice to or authorization by Awardee, (i) sell or arrange for the sale of Common Shares to be issued upon the vesting of Earned PSAs or other event to satisfy
the withholding obligation, and/or (ii) withhold in Common Shares, provided that the Company and Awardee’s actual employer shall withhold only the
amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount or such other amount determined by the Company as not resulting in negative
accounting consequences for the Company. Awardee will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Common Shares subject to the Earned PSAs,
notwithstanding that a number of whole vested Common Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. Awardee shall pay to
the Company or to Awardee’s actual employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or Awardee’s actual employer may be required to withhold
as a result of Awardee’s receipt of PSAs, the vesting of Earned PSAs, or the conversion of vested Earned PSAs to Common Shares that cannot be satisfied by
the means described in this paragraph. Except where applicable legal or regulatory provisions prohibit and notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the
contrary, the standard process for the payment of an Awardee’s Tax-Related Items shall be for the Company or Awardee’s actual employer to withhold in
Common Shares only to the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount or such other amount determined by the Company as not
resulting in negative accounting consequences for the Company. The Company may refuse to deliver Common Shares to Awardee if Awardee fails to comply
with Awardee’s obligation in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section 9.

(c) In lieu of issuing fractional Common Shares, on the vesting of a fraction of an Earned PSA, the Company shall round the shares down to the nearest whole
share.

(d) Until the distribution to Awardee of the Common Shares in respect of the vested Earned PSAs is evidenced by deposit in Awardee’s brokerage account,
Awardee shall have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Common Shares, notwithstanding the
vesting of Earned PSAs. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date Awardee is recorded as the
owner of the Common Shares, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.

(e) By accepting the Award of PSAs evidenced by this Award Agreement, Awardee agrees not to sell any of the Common Shares received on account of
vested Earned PSAs at a time when applicable laws or Company policies prohibit a sale. This restriction shall apply so long as Awardee is an Employee,
Consultant or outside director of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.

10. Non-Transferability of PSAs. Awardee’s right in the PSAs awarded under this Award Agreement and any interest therein may not be sold, pledged,
assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner, other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. PSAs shall not be subject to
execution, attachment or other process.

11. Acknowledgment of Nature of Plan and PSAs. In accepting the Award, Awardee acknowledges that:

(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company
at any time, as provided in the Plan;

(b) the Award of PSAs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of PSAs or other awards, or
benefits in lieu of PSAs even if PSAs have been awarded repeatedly in the past;

(c) all decisions with respect to PSAs or other future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;

(d) Awardee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary;

(e) the future value of the underlying Common Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;

(f) if Awardee receives Common Shares, the value of the Common Shares acquired on vesting of Earned PSAs may increase or decrease in value;

(g) notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the Plan to the contrary and consistent with Section 5 above, in the event of termination of Awardee’s
Continuous Status as a Participant under circumstances where Section 7 above does not apply (whether or not in breach of applicable laws), Awardee’s right
to receive PSAs, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Awardee is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period
mandated under applicable law. Awardee’s right to receive Common Shares pursuant to any Earned PSAs after termination of Continuous Status as a
Participant, if any, will be calculated as of the date of termination of Awardee’s active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated
under applicable law; or if later, the Determination Date in the event of continued vesting under Section 7 above. The senior corporate officer in charge of the
Company’s Human Resources department has the exclusive discretion to determine when Awardee is no longer actively employed for purposes of the award
of PSAs; and

(h) Awardee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause, notice or pre-termination procedure or
whether Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that Awardee’s employment was terminable only for cause or only with notice or pre-termination procedure,
Awardee has no right to, and will not bring any legal claim or action for, (a) any damages for any portion of any Earned PSAs that have been vested and
converted into Common Shares, or (b) termination of any unvested PSAs under this Award Agreement.

12. No Employment Right. Awardee acknowledges that neither the fact of this Award of PSAs nor any provision of this Award Agreement or the Plan or the
policies adopted pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon Awardee any right with respect to employment or continuation of current employment with the
Company or with Awardee’s actual employer, or to employment that is not terminable at will. Awardee further acknowledges and agrees that neither the Plan
nor this Award of PSAs makes Awardee’s employment with the Company or Awardee’s actual employer for any minimum or fixed period, and that this
employment is subject to the mutual consent of Awardee and the Company or Awardee’s actual employer, and may be terminated by either Awardee or the
Company or Awardee’s actual employer at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without cause or notice or any kind of pre- or post-termination
warning, discipline or procedure.

13. Administration. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the authority to manage and control the operation and administration of this Award
Agreement shall be vested in the Committee, and the Committee shall have all powers and discretion with respect to this Award Agreement as it has with
respect to the Plan. Any interpretation of the Award Agreement by the Committee and any decision made

by the Committee with respect to the Award Agreement shall be final and binding on all parties. References to the Committee in this Award Agreement shall
be read to include a reference to any delegate of the Committee acting within the scope of his or her delegation.

14. Plan Governs. Except as provided in Schedule A, this Award Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Plan and the EOIP, and this Award Agreement
is subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations promulgated by the Committee from time to time pursuant to the Plan and the EOIP.

15. Notices. Any written notices provided for in this Award Agreement that are sent by mail shall be deemed received three business days after mailing, but
not later than the date of actual receipt. Notices shall be directed, if to Awardee, at Awardee’s address indicated by the Company’s records and, if to the
Company, at the Company’s principal executive office.

16. Electronic Delivery. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to PSAs awarded under the Plan or future PSAs
that may be awarded under the Plan by electronic means or request Awardee’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. Awardee hereby
consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and
maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company.

17. Acknowledgment. By Awardee’s acceptance of this Award Agreement in the manner prescribed by the Company, Awardee acknowledges that Awardee
has received and has read, understood and accepted all the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Award Agreement (including the policy referenced in
Section 3(b)) and the Plan. Awardee understands and agrees that this Award Agreement is subject to all the terms, conditions, and restrictions stated in this
Award Agreement and in the other documents referenced in the preceding sentence, as the latter may be amended from time to time in the Company’s sole
discretion.

18. Board Approval. These PSAs have been awarded pursuant to the Plan and this Award of PSAs has been approved by the Committee or the Board of
Directors.

19. Governing Law and Venue. This Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without regard to Washington laws
that might cause other law to govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law. The venue for any litigation related to this Award Agreement will be in
King County, Washington.

20. Severability. If one or more of the provisions of this Award Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall
be deemed null and void; however, to the extent permissible by law, any provisions that could be deemed null and void shall first be construed, interpreted or
revised retroactively to permit this Award Agreement to be construed so as to foster the intent of this Award Agreement and the Plan.

21. Complete Award Agreement and Amendment. This Award Agreement (including the policy referenced in Section 3(b)) and the Plan constitute the entire
agreement between Awardee and the Company regarding PSAs. Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning these PSAs are superseded.
This Award Agreement may be amended only by written agreement of Awardee and the Company, without consent of any other person, provided that no
consent is necessary to an amendment that in the reasonable judgment of the Committee confers a benefit on Awardee. Awardee agrees not to rely on any oral
information regarding this Award of PSAs or any written materials not identified in this Section 21.

22. Code Section 409A. Payments under this Award Agreement are intended to be exempt from Code section 409A to the extent they satisfy the “short-term
deferral exception” under Code section 409A and otherwise to be compliant with Code section 409A, and this Award Agreement shall be interpreted,
operated and administered accordingly. To the extent applicable, each payment under this Award Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for
purposes of Code section 409A.

23. Code Section 162(m). The Award is intended to satisfy the applicable requirements for the performance-based compensation exception under Code
section 162(m) and applicable IRS guidance issued thereunder, and it is intended that the Award be interpreted, operated and administered to meet such
requirements.
