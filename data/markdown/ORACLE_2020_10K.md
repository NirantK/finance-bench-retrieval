PART I

Item 1.Business

Oracle  provides  products  and  services  that  address  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  environments.  Our  products  and  services  include  applications  and
infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise
deployments, cloud-based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployment) such as our Oracle
Cloud  at  Customer  offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer’s  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our  customers  and
facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government
agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner
Network.

Oracle  Cloud  Software-as-a-Service  and  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (SaaS  and  IaaS,  respectively,  and  collectively,  Oracle  Cloud  Services)  offerings  provide  a
comprehensive and integrated stack of applications and infrastructure services delivered via a cloud-based deployment model. Oracle Cloud Services integrate
the  software,  hardware  and  services  on  a  customer’s  behalf  in  a  cloud-based  IT  environment  that  Oracle  deploys,  upgrades,  supports  and  manages  for  the
customer.  Oracle  Cloud  Services  are  designed  to  be  rapidly  deployable  to  enable  customers  shorter  time  to  innovation;  intuitive  for  casual  and  experienced
users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and
extendibility between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring
lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable.

Oracle  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  deployment  offerings  include  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database  and  Oracle  Middleware  software  offerings,
among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all
customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.

Oracle hardware product offerings include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to
purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware.

Oracle also offers services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.

Providing choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element
of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and
infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer
offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer’s transition to cloud-based IT environments.

Our investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our cloud and license, hardware and services businesses
(described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we invested $6.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $6.1
billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and products and to develop new technologies and services. We
have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts on
improving the performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors; making it easier for organizations
to  deploy,  use,  manage  and  maintain  our  offerings;  and  incorporating  emerging  technologies  within  our  offerings  to  enable  leaner  business  processes,
automation and innovation. For example, the Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure through an Oracle Cloud IaaS
offering  that  utilizes  Oracle’s  Generation  2  Cloud  Infrastructure’s  machine  learning  capabilities.  After  an  initial  purchase  of  Oracle  products  and  services,  our
customers can continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings
for their

3

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud
Services contracts with us.

Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and
services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase
stockholder  value.  We  have  invested  billions  of  dollars  over  time  to  acquire  a  number  of  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies  that  add  to,  are
complementary  to,  or  have  otherwise  enhanced  our  existing  offerings.  We  expect  to  continue  to  acquire  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies  to
further our corporate strategy.

We have three businesses:

•

•

•

our cloud and license business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our Oracle Cloud Services offerings, cloud license and
on-premise license offerings, and license support offerings, represented 83% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, and 81% of our
total revenues in fiscal 2018;

our hardware business, which is comprised of a single operating segment and includes our hardware products and related hardware support services
offerings, represented 9% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, and 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018; and

our services business, which is comprised of a single operating segment, represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, and
9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018.

Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  results  of  Operations  and  Note  15  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  both
included elsewhere in this Annual report, provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments.

Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.

Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business

Oracle  is  committed  to  the  health,  safety  and  welfare  of  our  employees,  customers,  suppliers,  communities,  stockholders  and  other  stakeholders.  While  the
world continues to navigate the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed to providing critical technologies, programs
and support to individuals and organizations to navigate, adjust and continue their operations in light of the unique demands and constraints imposed by the
pandemic.  For  decades,  we  have  developed,  delivered  and  supported  products  and  services  that  enable  telecommunication  companies  to  keep  people
connected; retailers to provide food and other necessities; researchers to identify solutions; hospitals to provide care; airlines to ensure travel; banks to help
people access funds; insurers to provide benefits; governments to keep people safe and informed; utilities to supply power and water; and many other critical
functions.

We  have  proactively  sought,  supported,  donated  to,  partnered  and  engaged  with  organizations  globally  that  provide  critical  medicines,  research,  goods  and
services to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including:

• medical research organizations, which power COVID-19 simulation and modeling projects using Oracle Cloud IaaS;

•

•

•

the  U.S.  federal  government,  which  received  an  Oracle  system  to  collect  and  distribute  information  as  to  how  COVID-19  patients  respond  to
potential therapies;

hospitals,  which  have  utilized  Oracle  infrastructure  technologies  to  rapidly  develop  and  deploy  applications  that  collect,  analyze  and  manage
characteristics of COVID-19 patients;

enterprises,  which  have  the  ability  to  complimentarily  access  Oracle  Human  Capital  Management  (HCM)  Cloud  options  for  employee  health  and
safety programs in order to proactively manage and respond to COVID-19 implications on their workforces;

4

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

•

•

state and local government agencies, which have utilized Oracle Cloud SaaS solutions to develop and target constituent outreach related to COVID-
19, and to assess, research and respond to COVID-19 incident management on a unified platform; and

pharmaceutical companies, which power their research and clinical trials using Oracle Health Sciences solutions;

among dozens of other specific use cases, programs and partnerships that Oracle has donated to, partnered with, developed and supported in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are critical to the business operations of our customers, which number in the hundreds of thousands across a
broad geographic and industry base. We are profitable and generate a large amount of positive cash flow from our operations and we do not believe the COVID-
19 pandemic will jeopardize either of these characteristics of our business. Other impacts due to COVID-19 on our business are currently unknown.

For  additional  details  regarding  the  impacts  and  risks  to  our  business  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  refer  to  Item  1A  risk  Factors  and  Item  7  Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations included elsewhere in this Annual report on Form 10-K.

Applications and Infrastructure Technologies

Oracle’s  comprehensive  portfolio  of  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  is  designed  to  address  an  organization’s  IT  environment  needs  including
business  process,  infrastructure  and  applications  development  requirements,  among  others.  Oracle  technologies  are  based  upon  industry  standards  and  are
designed to be enterprise-grade, reliable, scalable and secure. Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies including database and middleware software
as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure products and services are the building
blocks  of  Oracle  Cloud  Services,  our  partners’  cloud  services,  and  our  customers’  cloud  IT  environments.  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  are
marketed  and  sold  through  our  cloud  and  license,  hardware,  and  services  businesses  and  are  delivered  through  the  Oracle  Cloud,  or  through  other  IT
deployment models including cloud-based, hybrid and on-premise deployments. We believe Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings enable flexibility,
interoperability and choice to best meet customer IT needs.

We believe that our Oracle Cloud Services offerings are opportunities for us to expand our cloud and license business. We believe that our customers increasingly
recognize the value of access to cloud-based applications and infrastructure capabilities via a lower cost, rapidly deployable, flexible and interoperable services
model that Oracle manages, upgrades and maintains on the customer’s behalf. We believe that we can market and sell our SaaS and IaaS offerings together to
help  customers  migrate  their  extensive  installed  base  of  on-premise  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  to  the  Oracle  Cloud  while  at  the  same  time
reaching a broader ecosystem of developers and partners. We also believe we can market our SaaS and IaaS services to small and medium-sized businesses and
non-IT lines of business purchasers due to the highly available, intuitive design, low touch and low cost characteristics of the Oracle Cloud.

In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services deployment models has
increased.  To  address  customer  demand  and  enable  customer  choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers  to  pivot  their  applications  and
infrastructure  licenses and  license  support  contracts  to  the  Oracle  Cloud  for new  deployments  and  to  migrate  to and  expand  with the  Oracle  Cloud  for  their
existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue.

Applications Technologies

Oracle applications technologies are marketed, sold, delivered and supported through our cloud and license business. Our applications cloud services and license
support revenues represented 40%, 40% and 38% of our total cloud services and license support revenues during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Oracle
applications technologies include our Oracle Cloud SaaS offerings, which are available for customers as a subscription, and

5

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

Oracle Applications license offerings, which are available for customers to purchase for use within the Oracle Cloud, and other cloud-based and on-premise IT
environments, with the option to purchase related license support. regardless of the deployment model selected, our applications technologies are designed to
reduce the risk, cost and complexity of our customers’ IT infrastructures, while supporting customer choice with flexible deployment models that readily enable
performance, agility, compatibility and extendibility. Our applications technologies are generally designed using industry standard architectures to manage and
automate core business functions across the enterprise, as well as to help customers differentiate and innovate in those processes unique to their industries or
organizations. We offer applications that are deployable to meet a number of business automation requirements across a broad range of industries. We also
offer  industry-specific  applications,  which  provide  solutions  to  customers  in  the  communications,  construction  and  engineering,  financial  services,  health
sciences, hospitality, manufacturing, public sector, retail and utilities industries, among others.

Oracle Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS)

Oracle’s broad spectrum of Oracle Cloud SaaS offerings provides customers a choice of software applications that are delivered via a cloud-based IT environment
that we host,  manage,  upgrade  and support,  and  that  customers purchase  by entering  into a subscription  agreement  with us  for a stated period. Customers
access Oracle Cloud SaaS offerings utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices. Our SaaS offerings are built upon open industry standards
such  as  SQL,  Java  and  HTML5  for  easier  application  accessibility,  integration  and  development.  Our  SaaS  offerings  represent  an  industry  leading  business
innovation  platform,  leveraging  our  Generation  2  Cloud  Infrastructure,  and  include  a  broad  suite  of  modular,  next  generation  cloud  software  applications
spanning all core business functions including, among others:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Oracle  Enterprise  resource  Planning  (ErP)  Cloud,  which  is  designed  to  be  a  complete,  global  and  integrated  ErP  solution  to  help  organizations
improve  decision  making  and  workforce  productivity,  and  to  optimize  back-office  operations  by  utilizing  a  single  data  and  security  model  with  a
common user interface;

Oracle Enterprise and Performance Management (EPM) Cloud, which is designed to analyze financial performance, drive accurate and agile financial
plans, optimize the financial close and consolidation process, streamline account reconciliation and satisfy an organization’s reporting requirements;

Oracle Supply Chain Management (SCM) Cloud, which is designed to help organizations create, optimize and digitize their supply chains and innovate
products quickly;

Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) Cloud, which is designed to help organizations find, develop and retain their talent, enable collaboration,
provide complete workforce insights, improve business process efficiency, and enable users to connect to an integrated suite of HCM applications
from any device;

Oracle Customer Experience Cloud including Sales, Service, Marketing and Data Cloud, which is designed to be a complete and integrated solution to
help organizations deliver consistent and personalized customer experiences across their customer channels, touch points and interactions. It also
enables organizations to leverage their own data and consumer data to inform and measure marketing strategies and programs; and

NetSuite Application Suite, which is a cloud-based ErP solution that is generally marketed to small to medium-sized organizations and is designed to
run  back-office operations and  financial processes,  and  includes  financial management,  revenue  management  and  billing, inventory, supply  chain
and warehouse management capabilities, among others.

We also offer a number of cloud-based industry solutions to address specific customer needs within certain industries.

We believe that the comprehensiveness and breadth of our SaaS offerings as a business innovation platform differentiate us from many of our competitors that
offer more limited or specialized applications. Our SaaS

6

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

offerings are designed to support connected business processes in the cloud and are centered on an intuitive interface, a responsive and flexible business core,
and a common data model. We believe Oracle ErP Cloud is a strategic suite of applications that is foundational to facilitate and extract more business value out
of the adoption of other Oracle SaaS offerings, such as Oracle HCM Cloud and Oracle EPM Cloud, as customers realize the value of a common data model that
spans across core business applications. Our SaaS offerings are designed to deliver a secure data isolation architecture and flexible upgrades; self-service access
controls  for  users;  a  Service-Oriented  Architecture  (SOA);  built-in  social,  mobile  and  business  insight  capabilities  (analytics);  and  a  high  performance,  high
availability infrastructure based on our infrastructure technologies, including Oracle’s Generation 2 Cloud Infrastructure. These SaaS capabilities are designed to
simplify IT environments, reduce time to implementation and risk, provide an intuitive user experience for casual and experienced users, and enable customers
to focus resources on business growth opportunities. Our SaaS offerings are also designed to natively incorporate emerging technologies such as Internet-of-
Things (IoT), artificial intelligence,  machine  learning, blockchain,  digital  assistants  and  advances  in  the  “human  interface”  and  how  users  interact  with  Oracle
Cloud SaaS offerings within a business context or to augment human capabilities to enhance productivity.

Oracle Applications Licenses

Customers have the ability to license Oracle Applications for use within the Oracle Cloud or within their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Oracle
Applications are designed to manage and automate core business functions across the enterprise, including HCM; ErP; financial management and governance,
risk  and  compliance;  procurement;  project  portfolio  management;  SCM;  business  analytics  and  enterprise  performance  management;  Oracle  Customer
Experience Cloud and customer relationship management; and industry-specific applications, among others.

As described below, we provide customers the option to purchase license support contracts in connection with the purchase of Oracle Applications licenses.

Oracle License Support

Oracle license support offerings  are marketed and sold as a part of our cloud and license business.  Substantially  all of our customers  opt to purchase  license
support contracts when they  purchase  Oracle applications and infrastructure licenses to run within the Oracle Cloud or other cloud-based and on-premise IT
environments. We believe our license support offerings protect and enhance our customers’ investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies
because they provide proactive and personalized support services including Oracle Lifetime Support and unspecified license enhancements and upgrades during
the term of the support period. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

devices. Oracle Cloud Operations leverage automated software tools to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities to the Oracle Cloud
as they become available, providing Oracle customers access to the latest Oracle technologies generally on a quarterly cadence.

Manufacturing

To produce our hardware products that we market and sell to third-party customers and that Oracle Cloud Operations utilize internally to deliver Oracle Cloud
Services, we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third-party manufacturing partners. Our internal manufacturing operations consist
primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers
and storage products. For all other manufacturing, we generally rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware-related components and
hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components
and products. We distribute most of our hardware products from either our facilities or partner facilities. Our manufacturing processes are substantially based on
standardization of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a “build-to-order” methodology in which products
generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product
subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources
are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. As a result, we monitor and evaluate potential risks of disruption
to our supply chain operations. refer to “risk Factors” included in Item 1A within this Annual report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter
with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business.

Sales and Marketing

We directly market and sell our cloud, license, hardware, support and services offerings to businesses of many sizes and in many industries, government agencies
and  educational  institutions.  We  also  market  and  sell  our  offerings  through  indirect  channels.  No  single  customer  accounted  for  10%  or  more  of  our  total
revenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.

In the United States (U.S.), our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country. Outside the U.S., our
international subsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through
a  direct  sales  subsidiary.  Our  geographic  coverage  allows  us  to  draw  on  business  and  technical  expertise  from  a  global  workforce,  provides  stability  to  our
operations and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends, and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings.
Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are more fully described in “risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual report. A summary of
our domestic and international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Annual report.

We  also  market  our  product  offerings  worldwide  through  indirect  channels.  The  companies  that  comprise  our  indirect  channel  network  are  members  of  the
Oracle  Partner  Network.  The  Oracle  Partner  Network  is  a  global  program  that  manages  our  business  relationships  with  a  large,  broad-based  network  of
companies, including independent software and hardware vendors, system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon
our  product  offerings.  By  offering  our  partners  access  to  our  product  offerings,  educational  information,  technical  services,  marketing  and  sales  support,  the
Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to
customers globally. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value-added resellers.

Research and Development

We develop the substantial majority of our product offerings internally. In addition, we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through
acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to
maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate
to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal
businesses.  rapid  technological  advances  in  cloud,  software and  hardware  development,  evolving  standards  in  computer  hardware  and  software technology,
changing  customer  needs  and  frequent  new  product  introductions,  offerings  and  enhancements  characterize  the  markets  in  which  we  compete.  We  plan  to
continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current products and services offerings.

Employees

As of May 31, 2020, we employed approximately 135,000 full-time employees, including approximately 36,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 19,000 in
our  cloud  services and  license  support  operations, approximately 3,000  in hardware, approximately 25,000  in services,  approximately 39,000  in research  and
development  and  approximately  13,000  in  general  and  administrative  positions.  Of  these  employees,  approximately  47,000  were  employed  in  the  U.S.  and
approximately 88,000 were employed internationally. None of our employees in the U.S. is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries,
labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our employees.

Seasonality and Cyclicality

Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans,
which are common in the technology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and
lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The  operating margins of our businesses  (in particular, our cloud  and  license business  and  hardware business) are generally
affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues because certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See
“Cloud  and  License  Business”  and  “Selected  Quarterly  Financial  Data”  in  Item  7  of  this  Annual  report  for  more  information  regarding  the  seasonality  and
cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins.

Competition

We face  intense  competition  in all aspects  of our  business.  The  nature  of the  IT  industry  creates  a competitive  landscape  that  is constantly  evolving  as firms
emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.

Our  customers  are  demanding  less  complexity  and  lower  total  cost  in  the  implementation,  sourcing,  integration  and  ongoing  maintenance  of  their  IT
environments.  Our  enterprise  cloud,  license  and  hardware  offerings  compete  directly  with  certain  offerings  from  some  of  the  largest  and  most  competitive
companies  in  the  world,  including  Amazon.com,  Inc.,  Microsoft  Corporation,  International  Business  Machines  Corporation  (IBM),  Intel  Corporation,  Cisco
Systems,  Inc.,  Adobe  Systems  Incorporated,  Alphabet  Inc.  and  SAP  SE,  as  well  as  other  companies  like  Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise,  salesforce.com,  inc.  and
Workday,  Inc.  In  addition,  due  to  the  low barriers  to  entry in  many  of our  market  segments,  new  technologies  and  new  and  growing  competitors  frequently
emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing
point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased
competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have
not  previously  competed.  Moreover,  we  or  our  competitors  may  take  certain  strategic  actions—including  acquisitions,  partnerships  and  joint  ventures,  or
repositioning of product lines—which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories.

14

•

•

the ease of deployment, use, transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings;

compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments, including our Oracle
Cloud environments;

the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors;

the broader “platform” competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the .NET programming environment of Microsoft;

operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems, with alternatives including Microsoft’s Windows Server, and
other UNIX and Linux operating systems;

the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers;

products, features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff;

products, features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants, systems integrators or other third parties; and

the attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers.

Item 1A.Risk Factors

We  operate  in  rapidly  changing  economic  and  technological  environments  that  present  numerous  risks,  many  of  which  are  driven  by  factors  that  we  cannot
control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial  Condition  and  results  of  Operations  (Item  7),  highlights  some  of  these  risks.  The  risks  described  below  are  not  exhaustive  and  you  should  carefully
consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  affected  how  we  and  our  customers  are  operating  our  respective  businesses,  and  the  duration  and  extent  to  which  this  will
impact our future results of operations and our overall financial performance remains uncertain.  A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in
late calendar year 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The long-term impacts, if any, of the global
COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  business  are  currently  unknown.  We  are  conducting  business  as  usual  with  modifications  to  employee  travel,  employee  work
locations,  and  cancellation  of  certain  marketing  events,  among  other  modifications.  We  will  continue  to  actively  monitor  the  situation  and  may  take  further
actions  that  alter  our  business  operations  as  may  be  required  by  federal,  state  or  local  authorities  or  that  we  determine  are  in  the  best  interests  of  our
employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential long-term effects of any such alterations or modifications may have
on our business, including the effects on our customers and prospects.

We have observed other companies, including customers and partners, taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Such
companies  may  take  further  actions  that  alter  their  normal  business  operations  if  there  are  future  spikes  of  COVID-19  infections  resulting  in  additional
government  mandated  shutdowns.  The  conditions  caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  have  adversely  affected  our  customers’  willingness  to  purchase  our
products and delayed prospective customers’ purchasing decisions.  The impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy have been
swift,  dramatic  and  unpredictable.  The  latency  and  duration  of  these  impacts  are  diverse  across  geographies  and  jurisdictions  in  which  we  market,  sell  and
develop our offerings. The depth and duration of the current economic declines attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and any potential economic recoveries,
are  not  currently  known.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2020  we  experienced  revenue  declines  compared  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2019  and  delayed
payments from customers. The effect of the pandemic for fiscal 2021 and future periods is unknown. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed.

Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and
services.         rapid  technological  advances,  intense  competition,  changing  delivery  models  and  evolving  standards  in  computer  hardware  and  software
development  and  communications  infrastructure,  changing  and  increasingly  sophisticated  customer  needs  and  frequent  new  product  introductions  and
enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance
and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not
purchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. renewals of these
contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new
products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.

We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving
innovations  in  technology  but  if  they  fail  to  operate  as  anticipated  or  our  other  products  do  not  perform  as  promised,  our  business  and  reputation  may  be
harmed.

17

In addition, our business may be adversely affected if:

• we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;

•

•

•

infrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated;

there is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new, enhanced or acquired product lines or
services;

there are changes in information technology (IT) trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts;

• we do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner; or

• we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.

Our  Oracle  Cloud  strategy,  including  our  Oracle  Cloud  Software-as-a-Service  and  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (SaaS  and  IaaS,  respectively,  and  collectively,
Oracle Cloud Services) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.     We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via
deployment models that best suit their needs, including via our cloud-based SaaS and IaaS offerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be
able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and
SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings. If we do not successfully execute
our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our
revenues and profitability could decline.

As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of
revenue  recognition  between  our  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license,  and  hardware  product  arrangements  relative  to  our  cloud  offering  arrangements.
Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of
the subscriptions. Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated
statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are generally recognized in full at
the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transition from or be able
to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and
demand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.

We might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings.      Despite testing prior to the
release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configuration
errors  that  can  impact  their  function,  performance  and  security,  and  result  in  other  negative  consequences.  The  detection  and  correction  of  any  errors  in
released cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to
properly function, integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings, could delay the development or release of new products or services or
new  versions  of  products  or  services,  could  create  security  vulnerabilities  in  our  products  or  services,  and  could  adversely  affect  market  acceptance  of  our
products or services. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud,
license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s business
operations  as  well  as  cloud  and  other  services  that  we  offer  to  our  customers  on  our  products  and  networks.  Therefore,  any  flaws  could  affect  our  and  our
customers’ abilities to conduct business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs. Enterprise
customers rely on our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings
and related services could expose us to product liability,

18

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.

If  our  security  measures  for  our  products  and  services  are  compromised  and  as  a  result,  our  data,  our  customers’  data  or  our  IT  systems  are  accessed
improperly,  made  unavailable,  or  improperly  modified,  our  products  and  services  may  be  perceived  as  vulnerable,  our  brand  and  reputation  could  be
damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduce
our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.     We are in the IT business, and our products and
services, including our Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, as well as our own
data. We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services, and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting
the integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage. At times, we encounter attempts by third parties (which
may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation states and individuals sponsored by
them)  to  identify  and  exploit  product  and  service  vulnerabilities,  penetrate  or  bypass  our  security  measures,  and  gain  unauthorized  access  to  our  or  our
customers’,  partners’  and  suppliers’  software,  hardware  and  cloud  offerings,  networks  and  systems,  any  of  which  could  lead  to  the  compromise  of  personal
information  or  the  confidential  information  or  data  of  Oracle  or  our  customers.  Computer  hackers  and  others  may  be  able  to  develop  and  deploy  IT  related
viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities
of  our  networks,  systems,  products  and  services,  create  system  disruptions  and  cause  shutdowns  or  denials  of  service.  This  is  also  true  for  third-party  data,
products or services incorporated into our own. Our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud Services, may also be accessed or modified improperly as a
result of customer, partner, employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or
suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers’, suppliers’
or partners’ data or the IT systems of Oracle, our customers, suppliers or partners.

Security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-attacks targeting IT products and businesses. Although this
is an industry-wide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally, it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their
efforts on the most prominent IT companies, and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for, and marketing efforts associated with, having secure
products and services. These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data, including
personal  information  and  our  customers’  confidential  information  and  data,  and  host  or  manage  parts  of  our  customers’  businesses  in  cloud-based  IT
environments,  especially  in  customer  sectors  involving  particularly  sensitive  data  such  as  health  sciences,  financial  services,  retail,  hospitality  and  the
government. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While
we make significant  efforts to address any IT security  issues with respect  to our acquired  companies,  we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these
companies within Oracle.

Because  the  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to,  or  sabotage  IT  systems  change  frequently,  grow  more  complex  over  time,  and  often  are  not
recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques. Our internal IT systems
continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with
these changes as new threats emerge. In addition, we often experience increased activity of this nature during times of instability, including during the COVID-19
pandemic,  when our operations may be more susceptible  to malfeasance due  to operational changes  instituted to comply with safety, health and regulatory
requirements, among others. We may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach.

We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification
of our customers’ or suppliers’ data, other external data, or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if
our products or services are reported to have or are perceived as having security vulnerabilities. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of
our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to not be

19

Table of Contents

secure. This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenues and earnings. The costs we would incur to address
and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to loss or destruction of information, inappropriate
use of proprietary and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations and financial penalties, and claims and increased legal liability,
including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring.

Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem. If there is a security vulnerability in one of
these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or harm
to our reputation or competitive position.

Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation,
legal requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection.     As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide
laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection and use within
our  business  will  intensify.  In  addition,  U.S.  and  foreign  governments  have  enacted  or  are  considering  enacting  legislation  or  regulations,  or  may  in  the  near
future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data
providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide.

In the  wake  of  the  European  Union  General  Data  Protection  regulation  (GDPr),  the  rate  of  global  consideration  and  adoption  of  privacy  laws has  increased,
giving rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle, and if we are not deemed to be in compliance, could
result in enforcement actions and/or fines. This is true in the U.S., where the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective in January 2020, the U.S.
Congress is considering several privacy bills at the federal level, and other state legislatures are considering privacy laws. regulators globally are also imposing
greater  monetary  fines  for  privacy  violations.  The  GDPr,  which  became  effective  in  May  2018,  provides  for  monetary  penalties  of  up  to  4%  of  an
organization’s worldwide revenue. These penalties can be significant. For example, one European data protection regulator has fined a major U.S. technology
company  EUr  50  million  for  its  data  handling  practices.  The  U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission  continues  to  fine  companies  on  a  regular  basis  for  unfair  and
deceptive data protection practices, and these fines may increase in size. The CCPA provides for statutory damages on a per violation basis that could be very
large in the event of a significant data security breach or other CCPA violation. Taken together, the changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced
protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection, and our cost of providing our products
and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we
have implemented contracts, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our
employees,  contractors,  partners,  data  providers  or  agents  will  not  violate  such  laws  and  regulations  or  our  contracts,  policies  and  procedures.  Additionally,
public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to
enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products and services.

We  make  statements  about  our  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information  through  our  privacy  policy,  information  provided  on  our  website  and  press
statements. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including
laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations,
could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect
our business and harm our reputation.

Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and
profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price.      Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we
have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:

20

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

general economic and business conditions;

overall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services;

governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and

general legal, regulatory and political developments.

Macroeconomic developments like the United Kingdom leaving the EU (Brexit), evolving trade policies between the U.S. and international trade partners, or the
occurrence  of  similar  events  in  other  countries  that  lead  to  uncertainty  or  instability  in  economic,  political  or  market  conditions  could  negatively  affect  our
business,  operating  results,  financial  condition  and  outlook,  which,  in  turn,  could  adversely  affect  our  stock  price.  Any  general  weakening  of,  and  related
declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to
reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause
customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.

In addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other
hostilities in various parts of the world, public health crises such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, and natural disasters continue to contribute
to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and
profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and, to a lesser
extent, also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.

If we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.     We face intense competition in all aspects
of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology
evolves and as delivery models change. Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure
technologies including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence,
compute,  storage  and  networking  products,  among  others,  which  compete  with  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings.  Use  of  our  competitors’
technologies  influences  a  customer’s  purchasing  decision  or  creates  an  environment  that  makes  it  less  efficient  to  utilize  or  migrate  to  Oracle  products  and
services. Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may not
generally find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce
new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more
flexible business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in
which  competitors  may  provide  software  and  intellectual  property  for  free.  Existing  or  new  competitors  could  gain  sales  opportunities  or  customers  at  our
expense.

We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.     The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general
economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop
products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings that are less favorable to us, or
offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results.
Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and
license,  hardware  and  services  offerings,  and  we  may  also  incur  increased  cloud  delivery  expenses  as  we  expand  our  cloud  operations  and  update  our
infrastructure,  all  of  which  could  reduce  our  revenues  and/or  profitability.  Our  license  support  fees  and  hardware  support  fees  are  generally  priced  as  a
percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which
could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings.

21

We introduced  Oracle  Bring  Your  Own  License  (BYOL)  and  Universal  Credit  Pricing  to  simplify  the  way  customers  purchase  and  consume  our  cloud  services.
Oracle BYOL enables customers to maintain their existing software licenses for Oracle Infrastructure while expanding their IaaS footprint at a discounted price.
Oracle  Universal  Credit  Pricing  provides  a  flexible  model  for  customers  to  access  Oracle  Infrastructure  services  on  demand  via  a  single  contract.  Any  future
changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new
pricing  policies.  Some  of  our  competitors  may  bundle  products  for  promotional  purposes  or  as  a  long-term  pricing  strategy,  commit  to  large  customer
deployments  at  prices  that  are  unprofitable,  or  provide  guarantees  of  prices  and  product  implementations.  These  practices  could,  over  time,  significantly
constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or
changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models.

Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.     We derive a substantial portion of our
revenues  from,  and  have  significant  operations,  outside  of  the  U.S.  Our  international  operations  include  cloud  operations,  cloud,  software  and  hardware
development, manufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers.

Compliance  with  international  and  U.S.  laws  and  regulations  that  apply  to  our  international  operations  increases  our  cost  of  doing  business  in  foreign
jurisdictions.  These  laws  and  regulations  include  U.S.  laws  and  local  laws  which  include  data  privacy  requirements,  labor  relations  laws,  tax  laws,  foreign
currency-related  regulations,  anti-competition  regulations,  anti-bribery  laws  and  other  laws  prohibiting  payments  to  governmental  officials  such  as  the  U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic
sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees,
and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our
products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our
international  expansion  efforts,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  employees,  our  business  and  our  operating  results.  Compliance  with  these  laws  requires  a
significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management’s attention from running our business operations and could harm our
ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts. Our
success  depends,  in  part,  on  our  ability  to  anticipate  these  risks  and  manage  these  difficulties.  We  monitor  our  operations  and  investigate  allegations  of
improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report
our  findings  to  government  authorities,  and  in  some  circumstances  such  authorities  conduct  their  own  investigations  and  we  respond  to  their  requests  or
demands for information. No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.

We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to:

•

•

•

•

general economic conditions, including the latency in economic impacts and associated economic recoveries, if any, in each country or region;

public health risks, social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations;

fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results;

difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets, in particular our
cash assets, in that country’s currency;

22

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

regulatory changes, including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may
unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to
pay in these countries;

political unrest, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;

common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics, practices and conduct policies;

natural disasters;

the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and increased storm sensitivity);

longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;

overlapping tax regimes; and

reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.

The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and the
sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.

As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly traded
company in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we
would otherwise have if these entities were wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Any failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.  Our customers
depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respond quickly
enough  to  accommodate  short-term  increases  in  customer  demand  for  support  services  or  may  be  inefficient  in  our  resolution  of  customer  support  issues.
Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Any failure to
maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our reputation,
our ability to sell our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.

We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors. Our revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-
premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. As a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate.

For our Oracle Cloud Services, our actual conversion or renewal rates may differ from those used in our forecasts because this business is continuing to evolve
and  such  rates  may  be  unpredictable  which  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  long-term  results.  For  our  license  business,  we  use  a  “pipeline”  system,  a
common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in that business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer
will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates
can be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts
can  be very  difficult  to estimate.  A reduction  in the  conversion  rates,  renewal  rates,  or in the pipeline  itself,  could  adversely  affect  our business  or results  of
operations. In particular, sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those being experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, a slowdown in IT
spending  or economic conditions generally can  unexpectedly  reduce  the conversion rates and renewal rates in particular periods as purchasing  decisions are
delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The conversion rates can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal
period  in  the  hope  of  obtaining  more  favorable  terms,  which  can  also  impede  our  ability  to  negotiate,  execute  and  deliver  upon  these  contracts  in  a  timely
manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines

23

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition. Conversion rates and renewal rates post-acquisition may be quite different
from the acquired companies’ historical conversion rates. Differences in conversion rates and renewal rates can also be affected by changes in business practices
that we implement in our newly acquired companies. These changes may negatively affect customer behavior.

A substantial portion of the revenue value of our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a
significant percentage of these are larger value orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue
shortfalls  tend  to  have  a  disproportionately  negative  impact  on  our  profitability.  The  number  of  large  license  transactions  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  hardware
products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our
quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions.

We  may  experience  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses.  Changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  can  adversely  affect  customer  demand  and  our  revenue  and
profitability.     We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign
currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results
and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to Brexit, and European sovereign and other debt obligations
may cause the value of the British Pound and Euro to fluctuate relative to the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of
the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in
U.S.  Dollars  after  converting  our  foreign  currency  results  into  U.S.  Dollars  and  in  terms  of  actual  demand  for  our  products  and  services  as  certain  of  these
products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins
on  sales  of  our  products  in  countries  outside  of  the  U.S.  Generally,  our  reported  revenues  and  operating  results  are  adversely  affected  when  the  dollar
strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected
when  the  dollar  strengthens  relative  to  other  currencies  as  a  portion  of  our  consolidated  cash  and  bank  deposits,  among  other  assets,  are  held  in  foreign
currencies and reported in U.S. Dollars.

In addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our
subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes
foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to
time. As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at
least  in  part  by gains  or  losses  on  the  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  in  an  effort  to mitigate  the  risks  and  volatility  associated  with  our  foreign  currency
transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with
respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency
gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should
we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the
size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of
operations, financial position and cash flows.

We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar. We
could incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary.

Our  periodic  workforce  restructurings  and  reorganizations  can  be  disruptive.         We  are  currently  restructuring  our  workforce  and  in  the  past  we  have
restructured  or  made  other  adjustments  to  our  workforce  in  response  to  management  changes,  product  changes,  performance  issues,  change  in  strategies,
acquisitions and other internal

24

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

and  external  considerations.  These  types  of  restructurings  have  resulted  in  increased  restructuring  costs  and  temporary  reduced  productivity  while  the
employees  adjusted  to  their  new  roles  and  responsibilities.  In  addition,  we  may  not  achieve  or  sustain  the  expected  growth,  resource  redeployment  or  cost
savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and
other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.

We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.     We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our
senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other members of our
executive  team;  and  other  key  employees.  In  the  technology  industry,  there  is  substantial  and  continuous  competition  for  highly  skilled  business,  product
development, technical and other personnel. We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher
sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term
employment or non-competition  agreements  with our employees. Members  of  our senior management  team have  left Oracle over the  years for  a variety of
reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.

We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at
lower  costs.  When  we  make  adjustments  to  our  workforce,  we  may  incur  expenses  associated  with  workforce  reductions  that  delay  the  benefit  of  a  more
efficient  workforce  structure.  We  may  also  experience  increased  competition  for  employees  in  these  countries  as  the  trend  toward  globalization  continues,
which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes to
immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.

Our  general  compensation  program  includes  restricted  stock  units  and  performance-based  equity,  which  are  important  tools  in  attracting  and  retaining
employees  in  our  industry.  If  our  stock  price  performs  poorly,  it  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  retain  or  attract  employees.  We  continually  evaluate  our
compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity
awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the
amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to
retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.

Our  sales  to  government  clients  expose  us  to  business  volatility  and  risks,  including  government  budgeting  cycles  and  appropriations,  procurement
regulations, governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.     We derive revenues from contracts
with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award,
administration and performance of those contracts.

Governmental  entities  are  variously  pursuing  policies  that  affect  our  ability  to  sell  our  products  and  services.  Changes  in  government  procurement  policy,
priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and requirements, and/or contract award criteria may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government
sector.  For  example,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  has  issued  cybersecurity  requirements  for  contractors’  internal  systems  through  a  mandatory
cybersecurity  contract  clause  referred  to  as  “DFArS  7012”  and  will  be  implementing  a  new  third-party  accreditation  program  known  as  the  Cybersecurity
Maturity  Model  Certification  (CMMC).    The  DFArS  7012  and  CMMC  requirements  may  impact  our  lines  of  business  in  the  U.S.  federal  government  market.
Compliance with these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly, and failure to meet the required security controls could limit our ability to sell products
and services, directly or indirectly, to the DoD and other federal government entities that implement similar cybersecurity requirements.

We  are also subject  to early  termination  of our  contracts.  Many  governmental  entities  have the  right  to terminate  contracts  at any  time,  without cause.  For
example,  the  U.S.  federal  government  may  terminate  any  of  our  government  contracts  and  subcontracts  at  its  convenience,  or  for  default  based  on  our
performance.

25

U.S. federal contracts are subject to the congressional approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts with
U.S.  state  and  local  governments,  foreign  governments  and  their  agencies  are  generally  subject  to  government  funding  authorizations.  Contracts  may  be
terminated based upon a lack of appropriated funds.

There  is  increased  pressure  on  governments  and  their  agencies,  both  domestically  and  internationally,  to  reduce  spending  as  governments  continue  to  face
significant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs.

Government contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If violations of law are found,
they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of
profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.

Acquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.     We continue
to  review  and  consider  strategic  acquisitions  of  companies,  products,  services  and  technologies.  We  have  a  selective  and  active  acquisition  program  and  we
expect  to  continue  to  make  acquisitions  in  the  future  because  acquisitions  are  an  important  element  of  our  overall  corporate  strategy.  risks  we  may  face  in
connection with our acquisition program include:

•

our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities;

• we  may  have  difficulties  (1)  managing  an  acquired  company’s  technologies  or  lines  of  business;  (2)  entering  new  markets  where  we  have  no,  or
limited,  direct  prior  experience  or  where  competitors  may  have  stronger  market  positions;  or  (3)  retaining  key  personnel  from  the  acquired
companies;

•

•

an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we
expected, we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay
for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially
cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill;

our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  (1)  claims  or  liabilities  that  we  assume  from  an  acquired  company  or
technology  or  that  are  otherwise  related  to  an  acquisition,  including,  among  others,  claims  from  government  agencies,  terminated  employees,
current or former customers, former stockholders or other third parties; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships that we assume from an acquired
company  that  we  would  not  have  otherwise  entered  into,  the  termination  or  modification  of  which  may  be  costly  or  disruptive  to  our  business;
(3)  unfavorable  revenue  recognition  or  other  accounting  treatment  as  a  result  of  an  acquired  company’s  practices;  and  (4)  intellectual  property
claims or disputes;

• we  may  fail  to  identify  or  assess  the  magnitude  of  certain  liabilities,  shortcomings  or  other  circumstances  prior  to  acquiring  a  company  or
technology, which could result in (1) unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, (2) unfavorable accounting treatment, (3) unexpected increases in
taxes due or the loss of anticipated tax benefits or (4) other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition;

• we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons, including (1) if a larger than predicted
number of customers decline to renew cloud-based subscription contracts or license support or hardware support contracts, (2) if we are unable to
sell  the  acquired  products  or  service  offerings  to  our  customer  base,  (3)  if  acquired  customers  do  not  elect  to  purchase  our  technologies  due  to
differing business practices or (4) if contract models utilized by an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis;

26

Table of Contents

• we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies, products, services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of

business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, architecture, controls, procedures and policies;

• we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered, priced, delivered and supported differently,

which could cause customer confusion and delays;

• we  may  incur  higher  than  anticipated  costs  (1)  to  support,  develop  and  deliver  acquired  products  or  services,  (2)  for  general  and  administrative
functions that support new business models, or (3) to comply with regulations applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we
had anticipated;

• we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or other sanctions imposed on
us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration
plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses;

• we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, which
could, among other things, (1) delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, (2) adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions,
(3) restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition, or (4) have other adverse effects on our current business
and operations;

•

our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including (1) stock repurchases, (2) dividend payments and (3)
retirement of outstanding indebtedness, among others;

• we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and
we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely
manner or on favorable terms;

•

to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and
earnings per share may decrease; and

• we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to U.S. generally accepted

accounting principles, including arrangements that we may assume in an acquisition.

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in
the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.

Our hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.     Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and
overall  profitability  and  related  growth  rates.  We  may  not  achieve  our  estimated  revenue,  profit  or  other  financial  projections  with  respect  to  our  hardware
business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:

•

•

•

•

our changes in hardware offerings, technologies and strategies, including shifting factory locations, which could adversely affect supply and demand
for our hardware products;

our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues, and thus has been less profitable, than our cloud and license business;

our  focus  on  certain  of  our  more  profitable  Oracle  Engineered  Systems  and  certain  other  hardware  products  we  consider  strategic  and  the  de-
emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products could adversely affect our hardware revenues;

changes  in  strategies  and  frequency  for  the  development  and  introduction  of  new  versions  or  next  generations  of  our  hardware  products  could
adversely affect our hardware revenues;

27

Table of Contents

•

•

•

general  supply  chain  material  shortages  worldwide  prior  to the  outbreak  of  COVID-19,  which  we expect  will be  further  exacerbated  globally  as a
result of the virus pandemic;

a  greater  risk  of  material  charges  that  could  adversely  affect  our  operating  results,  such  as  potential  write-downs  and  impairments  of  our
inventories; higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses; and amortization and potential
impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business;

decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives, which could adversely affect
our hardware revenues; and

• we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but (1) operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating
margins  than  our  own;  (2)  have  different  legacy  business  practices  and  go-to-market  strategies  than  our  own  that  we  may  alter  as  a  part  of  our
integration efforts, which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company; (3) leverage different platforms
or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating; or (4) utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to
scale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations.

Our hardware offerings are complex products, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, the results of our hardware business will suffer.     We
depend on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products, and there are
some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints.
As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural
disasters,  political  unrest,  public  health  crises  such  as  the  outbreak  of  the  novel  coronavirus  COVID-19,  changes  to  trade  policies,  port  stoppages  or  other
transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where
the  products  are  being  shipped.  We  may  be  unable  to  purchase  these  items  from  the  respective  single  vendors  on  acceptable  terms  or  may  experience
significant shortages, delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If one or more of the risks
described above occurs, our hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.

We are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.     We outsource the manufacturing,
assembly, delivery and technology or component design of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the
U.S. From time to time, these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products. To reduce this risk, we continue to
explore additional third-party manufacturing partners to drive supply chain continuity, but finding additional manufacturing sources in a timely and cost-effective
manner is difficult. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused a loss of sales during our fourth quarter of fiscal
2020. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products
expenses,  all  of  which  could  adversely  affect  the  margins  of  our  hardware  business.  These  challenges  and  risks  also  exist  when  we  acquire  companies  with
hardware products and related supply chain operations and could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers or locations. In some cases, we may be
dependent, at least initially, on these acquired companies’ supply chain operations or other manufacturing operations that we are less familiar with and thus we
may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks.

Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results.     Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect channel
network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators
and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing
and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel
participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel

28

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

participant, if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants’ products
and  services  were  to  decrease.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will be  successful  in  maintaining,  expanding  or  developing  our  relationships  with  channel
participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.     We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,
controls  and  contractual  commitments  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights.  Despite  our  efforts,  these  protections  may  be  limited.  Unauthorized  third
parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be
invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the
scope of the claims we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do
the laws and courts of the U.S. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not
remain competitive.

Third parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.
    We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights
and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products
or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of
infringement and misuse. We expect to continue to receive such claims as:

• we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies;

•

•

•

•

the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows;

the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry;

the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and

non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments.

responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

be time consuming, costly and result in litigation;

divert management’s time and attention from developing our business;

require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;

require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products;

require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms;

require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or

otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We  may  not  receive  significant  revenues  from  our  current  research  and  development  efforts  for  several  years,  if  at  all.         Developing  our  various  product
offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of our
corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both
through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired. Accelerated product and service introductions
and short lifecycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue
increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our

29

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for
several years, if at all.

Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.     A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic
areas, some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S.
We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing
services, including some of our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes. A major
earthquake or fire, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change
(such as increased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business, supply chains or IT systems
could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.

Adverse litigation results could affect our business.     We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our
operations,  and  can  divert  our  management’s  attention  away  from  running  our  core  business.  The  results  of  our  litigation  also  cannot  be  predicted  with
certainty.  An  adverse  decision  could  result  in  monetary  damages  or  injunctive  relief  that  could  affect  our  business,  operating  results  or  financial  condition.
Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Annual report.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.     As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both
the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities, including those arising from potential
changes in laws in the countries in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws. Many
judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities,
which often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact
on our tax rate.

Increasingly,  countries  around  the  world  are  actively  considering  or  have  enacted  changes  in  relevant  tax,  accounting  and  other  laws,  regulations  and
interpretations. In particular, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the U.S., which has an
ongoing impact on our provision for income taxes. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal revenue Service (IrS), and other standards-setting bodies are
continuing to issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied and it is possible that the guidance may differ from our interpretation of the
legislation.  The  Tax  Act  requires  complex  computations  not  previously  required  or  produced,  and  necessitates  that  we  make  significant  judgments  and
assumptions in the interpretation of the law where there is a lack of guidance.

Such uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act to our ongoing operations as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the U.S.
political landscape create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have an adverse impact on our future tax rate.
Various Democratic proposals would partially or wholly reverse beneficial features of the Tax Act, such as by raising the U.S. corporate tax rate and increasing the
tax  on  non-U.S.  income.    A  change  in  party  control  of  the  White  House  and  U.S.  Senate  thus  could  lead  to  dramatic  changes  in  the  tax  law  and  result  in  an
increase in our provision for income taxes.  Increased federal and state fiscal spending to fund COVID-19 relief measures, coupled with a drop in tax revenue
from pandemic-related reductions in economic activity, will add to the pressure to raise more tax revenue from federal and state corporate income and other
taxes or to enact new types of taxes on businesses and their customers.

Other countries also continue to consider enacting changes to their tax laws that could adversely affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our revenue streams
and  foreign  subsidiaries,  including  changes  in  withholding  tax  regimes  and  the  imposition  of  taxes  targeted  at  certain  technology  businesses.  More
fundamentally, longstanding international tax principles that determine each country’s right to tax cross-border transactions are being

30

Table of Contents

reconsidered, creating significant uncertainty as to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operations. This re-examination is driven by a
perceived need to provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located. Various measures are being discussed, including
adjustments to transfer pricing rules, limitations on deductions, and imposition of additional withholding taxes. The foregoing changes brought about by the Tax
Act in combination with the uncertain international tax environment have upended expectations and the predictability and reliability of the global tax system,
leading to the ongoing re-evaluation of our global legal and tax operating structure.  The resulting potential modifications to our structure could adversely impact
our provision for income taxes.

Inherent  in  our  global  business  operations  and  legal  entity  structure  are  many  intercompany  transactions  and  calculations  made  in  the  ordinary  course  of
business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the IrS and by foreign
tax  jurisdictions  and  will  likely  be  subject  to  additional  audits  in  the  future.  Although  we  have  negotiated  a  number  of  agreements  with  certain  taxing
jurisdictions, these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing. In recent periods, transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions
have become increasingly contentious. Similarly, certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters under current law.
In addition, our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions or regimes that have relatively lower statutory tax
rates to those in which the rates are relatively higher.

We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. and
various foreign jurisdictions that have uncertain applicability to the businesses in which we are engaged. Although we believe that our income and non-income
based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in
our historical income tax provisions and accruals.

There  are  risks  associated  with  our  outstanding  and  future  indebtedness.         As  of  May  31,  2020,  we  had  an  aggregate  of  $71.6  billion  of  outstanding
indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2020 and calendar year 2060, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay
interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service
such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.

We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the
terms  of  any  refinancing  may  not  be  as  favorable  as  the  terms  of  our  existing  debt.  Furthermore,  if  prevailing  interest  rates  or  other  factors  at  the  time  of
refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.

Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited,
which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating
could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These
risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.     Some of our cloud
and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials
used  for  these  products,  human  health  and  safety,  the  use  of  certain  chemical  substances  and  the  labor  practices  of  suppliers,  as  well  as  local  testing  and
labelling requirements. Compliance with these ever-changing environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development,
procurement,  manufacturing,  delivery,  cloud  operations  and  administration  costs,  limit  our  ability  to  manage  excess  and  obsolete  non-compliant  inventory,
change  our  sales  activities,  or  otherwise  impact  future  financial  results  of  our  cloud  and  hardware  businesses.  Any  violation  of  these  laws  can  subject  us  to
significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses.

regulatory, market, and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow.

The SEC has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. Our supply
chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware end-products, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining
of any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited. Our
relationships  with  customers  and  suppliers  could  suffer  if  we  are  unable  to  describe  our  products  as  “conflict-free.”  We  may  also  face  increased  costs  in
complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements.

A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on restriction of Hazardous
Substances (roHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling
Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU,
China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The UK Government has
announced a procurement policy that includes environmental, social and economic sustainability measures.

Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.    All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The
timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new products, product enhancements, technological advances, acquisitions
or major transactions could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price. Our
stock  price  could  also  be  affected  by  factors,  some  of  which  are  beyond  our  control,  including,  among  others:  speculation  in  the  press  and  the  analyst
community,  changes  in  recommendations  or  earnings  estimates  by  financial  analysts,  changes  in  investors’  or  analysts’  valuation  measures  for  our  stock,
negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys, earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors’ expectations, our
credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action
lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.

We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.   In fiscal 2020, our
Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $30.0 billion. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and
we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even
if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.

Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.     Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to
Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC)  805,  Business  Combinations,  we  recognize  the  identifiable  assets  acquired,  the  liabilities  assumed  and  any  non-
controlling  interests  in  acquired  companies  generally  at  their  acquisition  date  fair  values  and,  in  each  case,  separately  from  goodwill.  Goodwill  as  of  the
acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition
date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable
but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating
results and may adversely affect our cash flows:

•

•

•

•

costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment
or relocation expenses;

impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets;

amortization of intangible assets acquired;

a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;

32

•

•

•

•

identification  of,  or  changes  to,  assumed  contingent  liabilities,  both  income  tax  and  non-income  tax  related,  after  our  final  determination  of  the
amounts  for  these  contingencies  or  the  conclusion  of  the  measurement  period  (generally  up  to  one  year  from  the  acquisition  date),  whichever
comes first;

charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative pre-merger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities
for a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated, charges to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, and charges to restructure
our operations or to reduce our cost structure;

charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and

charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.

Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will adversely impact our operating results for the periods in which those costs are incurred.
Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the
extent of integration activities. A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the “Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations (Item 7) included elsewhere in this
Annual report.

Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.Properties

Our  properties  consist  of  owned  and  leased  office  facilities  for  sales,  support,  research  and  development,  services,  manufacturing,  cloud  operations  and
administrative and other functions. Our headquarters facility consists of approximately 2.1 million square feet in redwood City, California, substantially all of
which we own. We also own or lease other facilities for current use consisting of approximately 25.4 million square feet in various other locations in the U.S. and
abroad. Approximately 2.8 million square feet, or 10%, of our total owned and leased space is sublet or is being actively marketed for sublease or disposition. We
lease our principal internal manufacturing facility for our hardware products in Hillsboro, Oregon. Our cloud operations deliver our Oracle Cloud Services through
the use of global data centers including those that we own and operate and those that we utilize through colocation suppliers. We believe that our facilities are
in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business.

Item 3.Legal Proceedings

The  material  set  forth  in  Note  14  (pertaining  to  information  regarding  contingencies  related  to  our  income  taxes)  and  Note  17  (pertaining  to  information
regarding legal contingencies) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5.Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our  common  stock  is  traded  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  under  the  symbol  “OrCL.”  According  to  the  records  of  our  transfer  agent,  we  had  8,511
stockholders of record as of May 31, 2020.

For equity compensation plan information, please refer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual report.

Stock Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019 and March 12, 2020, we announced
that  our  Board  of  Directors  approved  expansions  of  our  stock  repurchase  program  totaling  $30.0  billion.  As  of  May  31,  2020,  approximately  $16.6  billion
remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.

Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital
needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic
and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May 31, 2020 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet
be purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program:

Our  net  income  and  diluted  earnings  per  share  were  impacted  in  fiscal  2019  and  2018  by  the  effects  of  our  adoption  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  of  2017  (the  Tax  Act).  The  more  significant
provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.

Working capital and total assets increased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2020 net income and the issuance of $20.0 billion of
long-term senior notes in fiscal 2020, partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in fiscal 2020. Working capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019
primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets
resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current
assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018 and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These working
capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented. In addition,
our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.

Our  notes  payable  and  other  borrowings,  which  represented  the  summation  of  our  notes  payable,  current,  and  notes  payable  and  other  borrowings,  non-current,  as  reported  per  our  consolidated
balance  sheets  as  of  the  dates  listed  in  the  table  above,  increased  during  fiscal  2020  primarily  due  to  the  issuance  of  $20.0  billion  of  long-term  senior  notes.    Notes  payable  and  other  borrowings
decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2016 and 2018 primarily due
to  the  fiscal  2018  issuance  of  long-term  senior  notes  of  $10.0  billion  and  short-term  borrowings  of  $2.5  billion,  the  fiscal  2017  issuance  of  long-term  senior  notes  of  $14.0  billion  and  short-term
borrowings  of  $3.8  billion,  and  fiscal  2016  short-term  borrowings  of  $3.8  billion.  See  Note  7  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  for  additional
information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings.

The summary consolidated financial data for the fiscal year ended and as of May 31, 2016 have not been updated to reflect the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) or
ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs (ASU 2017-07). refer to our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2019 for additional discussion regarding Oracle’s adoption of these accounting pronouncements.

Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This
overview  is  followed  by  a  summary  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that  we  believe  are  important  to  understanding  the  assumptions  and
judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.

Business Overview

Oracle  provides  products  and  services  that  address  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  environments.  Our  products  and  services  include  applications  and
infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on‑premise
deployments, cloud‑based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud‑based deployment) such as our Oracle
Cloud  at  Customer  offering  (an  instance  of  Oracle  Cloud  in  a  customer’s  own  data  center).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and  flexibility  to  our  customers  and
facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network,
we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.

We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a
part  of  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  results  of  Operations  and  the  information  contained  within  Note  15  of  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments
and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results
and allocate resources.

Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business

For a discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to “Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business” included in
Item  1  Business  in  this  Annual  report,  the  risks  included  in  Item  1A  risk  Factors  in  this  Annual  report  and  the  information  presented  below  in  results  of
Operations in this Item 7.

Cloud and License Business

Our cloud and license line of business, which represented 83% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum
of applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings.

Cloud services and license support revenues include:

•

•

license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services
in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments.
Substantially  all  license  support  customers  renew  their  support  contracts  with  us  upon  expiration  in  order  to  continue  to  benefit  from  technical
support  services  and  the  periodic  issuance  of  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements,  which  current  license  support  customers  are  entitled  to
receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-
premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer’s option; and are
generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and

cloud services revenues, which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment
models  that  Oracle  develops,  provides  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements  for,  hosts,  manages  and  supports  and  that  customers  access  by
entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services

37

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at
the customer’s option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage
model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time.

Cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  revenues  include  revenues  from  the  licensing  of  our  software  products  including  Oracle  Applications,  Oracle  Database,

Oracle  Middleware  and  Java,  among  others,  which  our  customers  deploy  within  cloud

based, on

premise  and  other  IT  environments.  Our  cloud  license  and

‑

‑

on

premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available

‑

to the customer to download and use. revenues from usage

based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the

‑

point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due
to the point in time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services
and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers
have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts as described above.

Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our
corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has
increased.  To  address  customer  demand  and  enable  customer  choice,  we  have  introduced  certain  programs  for  customers  to  pivot  their  applications  and
infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their
existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue.

Our cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental
budgetary  constraints;  the  strategy  for  and  competitive  position  of  our  offerings;  the  continued  renewal  of  our  cloud  services  and  license  support  customer
contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases;
the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; and
foreign currency rate fluctuations.

On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:

•

•

expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and

continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.

We  believe  these  factors  should  contribute  to  future  growth  in  our  cloud  and  license  business’  revenues,  which  should  enable  us  to  continue  to  make
investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services.

Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical
upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed
in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is
primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably;
the  renewal  of  existing  customers’  cloud  services  and  license  support  contracts  over  the  course  of  each  fiscal  year  that  we  generally  recognize  as  revenues
ratably; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in
each case over those four quarterly periods.

Hardware Business

Our  hardware  business,  which  represented  9%  of  our  total  revenues  in  each  of  fiscal  2020  and  2019,  provides  a  broad  selection  of  hardware  products  and
hardware-related  software  products  including  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage,  industry-specific  hardware  offerings,  operating  systems,
virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an
operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this
combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer
and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services
and  to  develop  new  hardware  products  and  services.  The  majority  of  our  hardware  products  are  sold  through  indirect  channels,  including  independent
distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are
essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include
product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer,
are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are
delivered over the contractual terms.

We  generally  expect  our  hardware  business  to  have  lower  operating  margins  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  than  our  cloud  and  license  business  due  to  the
incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.

Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected
by  many  factors,  including  our  ability  to  timely  manufacture  or  deliver  a  few  large  hardware  transactions;  our  strategy  for  and  the  position  of  our  hardware
products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic
and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the
time  of  hardware  product  sale;  the  percentage  of  our  hardware  support  contract  customer  base  that  renews  its  support  contracts  and  the  close  association
between  hardware  products,  which  have  a  finite  life,  and  customer  demand  for  related  hardware  support  as  hardware  products  age;  customer  decisions  to
either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.

Services Business

Our services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of
their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies.  We  believe  that  our  services  are  differentiated  based  on  our  focus  on  Oracle
technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced customer
services and education services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected
by many factors including, our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and
the  associated  services  for  these  offerings;  general  economic  conditions;  governmental  budgetary  constraints;  personnel  reductions  in  our  customers’  IT
departments; and tighter controls over customer discretionary spending.

Acquisitions

Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a
number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. The pace of our acquisitions has slowed recently, but as compelling opportunities
become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of

Index to Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions.

We  believe  that  we  can  fund  our  future  acquisitions  with  our  internally  available  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities,  cash  generated  from
operations,  additional  borrowings  or  from  the  issuance  of  additional  securities.  We  estimate  the  financial  impact  of  any  potential  acquisition  with  regard  to
earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board’s  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the  various  staff  accounting  bulletins  and  other  applicable
guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates,
judgments  and  assumptions  upon  which  we  rely  are  reasonable  based  upon  information  available  to  us  at  the  time  that  these  estimates,  judgments  and
assumptions  are  made.  These  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  can  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  as  of  the  date  of  the  financial
statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these
estimates,  judgments  or  assumptions  and  actual  results,  our  financial  statements  will  be  affected.  The  accounting  policies  that  reflect  our  more  significant
estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  and  which  we  believe  are  the  most  critical  to  aid  in  fully  understanding  and  evaluating  our  reported  financial  results
include:

•

•

•

•

•

revenue recognition;

Business Combinations;

Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments;

Accounting for Income Taxes; and

Legal and Other Contingencies.

Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Note  1  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  includes  additional  information  about  our  critical  and  other
accounting policies.

Revenue Recognition

The most critical judgments required in applying Topic 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations
and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation.

Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a
customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple
products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We
allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below)
for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer
contract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered.

We use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance
obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately
in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or
when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can

40

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

evolve  over  time  due  to  changes  in  our  pricing  practices  that  are  influenced  by  intense  competition,  changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and  services,  and
economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers
elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid
by the customer to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the
same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions
or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is
determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price
based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.

Business Combinations

We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains
to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted
and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual
assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred
over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately
value  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date  as  well  as  any  contingent  consideration,  where  applicable,  our  estimates  are  inherently
uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record
adjustments  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  with  the  corresponding  offset  to  goodwill.  Upon  the  conclusion  of  a  business  acquisition’s
measurement  period  or  final  determination  of  the  values  of  assets  acquired  or  liabilities  assumed,  whichever  comes  first,  any  subsequent  adjustments  are
recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.

Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our
estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we
believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and
information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that
may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

For a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of
these  pre-acquisition  contingencies  throughout  the  measurement  period  in  order  to  obtain  sufficient  information  to  assess  whether  we  include  these
contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.

If  we  cannot  reasonably  determine  the  fair  value  of  a  non-income  tax  related  pre-acquisition  contingency  by  the  end  of  the  measurement  period,  which  is
generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset
existed  or  a  liability  had  been  incurred  at  the  acquisition  date  and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Subsequent  to  the
measurement  period  or  final  determination  of  the  net  asset  values  for  the  business  combination,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  such  contingencies  will  affect
earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.

In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We
reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and

41

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

circumstances  that  existed  as  of  the  acquisition  date  with  any  adjustments  to  our  preliminary  estimates  being  recorded  to  goodwill  if  identified  within  the
measurement  period.  Subsequent  to  the  measurement  period  or  our  final  determination  of  the  tax  allowance’s  or  contingency’s  estimated  value,  whichever
comes  first,  changes  to  these  uncertain  tax  positions  and  tax  related  valuation  allowances  will  affect  our  provision  for  income  taxes  in  our  consolidated
statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes  in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make
certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of
our reporting units.

Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and
other  factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerations,  macroeconomic  conditions,  and  other  relevant  events  and  factors  affecting  the
reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test
is then performed.

Performing  a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test  includes  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  and  involves  significant  estimates  and
assumptions.  These  estimates  and  assumptions  include,  among  others,  revenue  growth  rates  and  operating  margins  used  to  calculate  projected  future  cash
flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.

We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment
may  exist.  In  such  situations,  we  are  required  to  evaluate  whether  the  net  book  values  of  our  finite  lived  intangible  assets  are  recoverable.  We  determine
whether  finite  lived  intangible  assets  are  recoverable  based  upon  the  forecasted  future  cash  flows  that  are  expected  to  be  generated  by  the  lowest  level
associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and
include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a
variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal
forecasts.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Judgment  is  required  in  determining  our  worldwide  income  tax  provision.  In  the  ordinary  course  of  a  global  business,  there  are  many  transactions  and
calculations  where  the  ultimate  tax  outcome  is  uncertain.  Some  of  these  uncertainties  arise  as  a  consequence  of  revenue  sharing  and  cost  reimbursement
arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation
of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these
matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our
income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.

We  record  a  valuation  allowance  to  reduce  our  deferred  tax  assets  to  the  amount  that  is  more  likely  than  not  to  be  realized.  In  order  for  us  to  realize  our
deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future
growth,  forecasted  earnings,  future  taxable  income,  the  mix  of  earnings  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate,  historical  earnings,  taxable  income  in  prior
years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event
we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future,  an adjustment  to the deferred tax assets
valuation  allowance  would  be  charged  to  earnings  in  the  period  in  which  we  make  such  a  determination,  or  goodwill  would  be  adjusted  at  our  final
determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the
net deferred tax assets would be

42

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment  to our provision for income taxes at such
time.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns
filed  during  the  subsequent  year.  Adjustments  based  on  filed  returns  are  generally  recorded  in  the  period  when  the  tax  returns  are  filed  and  the  global  tax
implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.

The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our
estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related
contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above.

For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes,
which  contains  a  two-step  approach  to  recognizing  and  measuring  uncertain  tax  positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  The  first  step  is  to
determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any
related appeals or litigation processes.  The second  step is to measure the tax benefit  as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon
ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final
outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial
rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters
is  different  than  the  amounts  recorded,  such  differences  generally  will  impact  our  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  period  in  which  such  a  determination  is
made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the
related interest and penalties.

Legal and Other Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial
exposure.  A  description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  is  provided  under  “Business
Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential
loss  from  any  claim  or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  both  the
determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these
matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess
the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could
have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Results of Operations

Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information

In our fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated
expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially
all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.

In addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 results of each our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are
our  operating  segments  as  defined  pursuant  to  ASC  280,  Segment  Reporting.  The  financial  reporting  for  our  three  businesses  that  is  presented  below  is
presented in a manner that is

43

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

consistent  with  that  used  by  our  CODMs.  Our  operating  segment  presentation  below  reflects  revenues,  direct  costs  and  sales  and  marketing  expenses  that
correspond  to and  are directly attributable to  each  of our three  businesses.  We also utilize these  inputs  to calculate  and  present  a segment  margin for each
business in the discussion below.

Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation is noted to include any revenues adjustments related
to  cloud  services  and  license  support  contracts  that  would  have  otherwise  been  recorded  by  the  acquired  businesses  as  independent  entities  but  were  not
recognized  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  periods  presented  due  to  business  combination  accounting  requirements.  refer  to
“Supplemental Disclosure related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Annual report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to
total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.

In addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets,
certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income, net and provision for
income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including
such items and/or it is impractical to do so. refer to “Supplemental Disclosure related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these
items  and  Note  15  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  for  a  reconciliation  of  the  summations  of  total
segment  margin  as  presented  in  the  discussion  below  to  total  income  before  provision  of  income  taxes  as  presented  per  our  consolidated  statements  of
operations for all periods presented.

A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, as filed
with  the  SEC  on  June  21,  2019,  which  is  available  free  of  charge  on  the  SEC’s  website  at  www.sec.gov  and  on  our  Investor  relations  website  at
www.oracle.com/investor.

Constant Currency Presentation

Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a
result, each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major
international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate
fluctuations,  we  compare  the  percent  change  in  the  results  from  one  period  to  another  period  in  this  Annual  report  using  constant  currency  disclosure.  To
present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars
at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2019, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect
during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2020 and 2019, our
financial  statements  would  reflect  reported  revenues  of  $1.10  million  in  fiscal  2020  (using  1.10  as  the  month-end  average  exchange  rate  for  the  period)  and
$1.11 million in fiscal 2019 (using 1.11 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate
the fiscal 2020 results using the fiscal 2019 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during either period. In each of the tables below,
we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues were flat in fiscal 2020. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’
revenues during fiscal 2020 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currency increase in our
cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as
customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud deployment models and license deployment models and renewed their related
cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technologies and support services. The constant currency decrease in our
hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was due to reductions in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues
primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of
certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. The constant currency decrease in
our services business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to declines in our consulting revenues and education revenues. Due to
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all three of our businesses’ revenues were adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and some of these
effects may continue into fiscal 2021. While we expect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for fiscal 2021 and future periods are unknown.
On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2020 total revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a decline in the Americas region.

Excluding  the  effects  of  currency  rate  fluctuations,  our  total  operating  expenses  decreased  during  fiscal  2020  relative  to  fiscal  2019  primarily  due  to  lower
expenses  for  substantially  all  of  our  operating  expense  categories  other  than  cloud  services  and  license  support  expenses,  which  increased  primarily  due  to
headcount and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; and research and development
expenses, which increased primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses. We curtailed a number of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of
fiscal 2020 including marketing

45

expenses and employee travel expenses in response to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses to normalize in future periods provided global economic
conditions improve.

In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 due to the decline in our
total expenses.

In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we
did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities
upon  delivery  of  the  contractual  obligations.  To  the  extent  customers  for  which  these  contractual  obligations  pertain  renew  these  contracts  with  us,  we  expect  to  recognize  revenues  for  the  full
contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.

For fiscal 2020 and 2019, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-
based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items; and, for fiscal 2019, after excluding a tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred
tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure and a tax benefit as described in footnote (7) below, resulted in effective tax rates of 18.4% and 18.5% in fiscal 2020 and 2019,
respectively, instead of 16.0% and 9.7%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations.

The fiscal 2019 income tax reform adjustment presented in the table above was due to an adjustment made pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to the enactment of the
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.

Cloud and License Business

Our  cloud  and  license  business  engages  in  the  sale  and  marketing  of  our  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  that  are  delivered  through  various
deployment  models  and  include:  Oracle  license  support  offerings;  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings;  and  Oracle  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  offerings.
License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased
by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services
deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates
and enhancements for, host, manage and support. revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to
three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned
from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and
on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and
use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market
certain  of  our  offerings  through  indirect  channels.  Costs  associated  with  our  cloud  and  license  business  are  included  in  cloud  services  and  license  support
expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and
license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.

Includes cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired
businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements.
Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment results and Other Financial
Information” above for additional information.

Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating
segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment results and Other Financial Information” above.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to growth in
our cloud services and license support revenues, which was primarily due to increased customer purchases and renewals of cloud-based services and license
support contracts in recent periods for which we delivered such services during fiscal 2020. Our cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impacted
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In constant currency, the
Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 8%, 34% and 58%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2020.

In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to higher cloud services and license
support expenses during fiscal 2020, which were primarily attributable to higher employee related expenses and higher technology infrastructure expenses to
support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower sales and marketing
expenses, which were primarily due to our curtailment of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, including reduced marketing expenses and
employee travel expenses, in response to COVID-19.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to the fiscal
2020 increases in revenues for this business, while total fiscal 2020 margins as a percentage of revenues remained flat.

Hardware Business

Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The
hardware  product  and  related  software,  such  as  an  operating  system  or  firmware,  are  highly  interdependent  and  interrelated  and  are  accounted  for  as  a
combined  performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  that  the  hardware
product  is  delivered  to  the  customer  and  ownership  is  transferred  to  the  customer.  Our  hardware  business  also  earns  revenues  from  the  sale  of  hardware
support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered
over  the  contractual  term,  which  is  generally  one  year.  The  majority  of  our  hardware  products  are  sold  through  indirect  channels  such  as  independent
distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our
hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal
manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of
inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support
services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our
hardware offerings.

Excluding  the  effects  of  currency  rate  fluctuations,  total  hardware  revenues  decreased  in  fiscal  2020  relative  to  fiscal  2019  due  to  lower  hardware  products
revenues and lower hardware support revenues. The decreases in hardware products and hardware support revenues in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 were
primarily  attributable  to  our  continued  emphasis  on  the  marketing  and  sale  of  our  cloud-based  infrastructure  technologies,  which  resulted  in  reduced  sales
volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our hardware business’
revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the economic effects caused by COVID-19. These unfavorable

49

Table of Contents

impacts to our fiscal 2020 hardware revenues were partially offset by increased hardware revenues related to certain of our strategic hardware offerings, namely
our Oracle Exadata offerings.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower hardware
products expenses, lower hardware support costs, and lower sales and marketing expenses, all of which aligned to lower hardware revenues.

In  constant  currency,  total  margin  and  total  margin  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  for  our  hardware  business  increased  in  fiscal  2020  compared  to  fiscal  2019
primarily due to lower hardware expenses.

Services Business

We  offer  services  to  customers  and  partners  to  help  maximize  the  performance  of  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies.
Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related
expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to declines in our
consulting services and education services revenues. Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to
the impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts of consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and jurisdictional restrictions imposed with
respect  to  in-person  meetings.  In  addition,  we  incurred  lower  billable  travel  expenses  and  lower  billable  sub-contractor  expenses  for  which  we  were  to  be
reimbursed by our customers, which reduced the amount of revenues and expenses we reported for this business during fiscal 2020.

In  constant  currency,  total  services  expenses  were  flat  in  fiscal  2020  compared  to  fiscal  2019  as  lower  expenses  incurred  for  travel  and  sub-contractors  as
described  above  and  lower  expenses  related  to  the  delivery  of  our  education  services  were  offset  by  higher  employee  related  expenses  associated  with  our
consulting offerings during fiscal 2020.

In  constant currency,  total margin and total margin as a percentage  of total services revenues  decreased during  fiscal 2020  relative to fiscal 2019  due to the
decrease in total revenues for this business.

Research and Development Expenses: research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest
significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

impacts of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by modestly higher fiscal 2020 employee salary expenses in constant currency.

Amortization of Intangible Assets:  Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets
over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment
based  upon  relevant  facts  and  circumstances.  Note  6  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report  has  additional

Amortization  of  intangible  assets  decreased  in  fiscal  2020  due  to  a  reduction  in  expenses  associated  with  certain  of  our  intangible  assets  that  became  fully
amortized, partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions.

Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other
employees, certain business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.

On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2020 due to higher other expenses, net including asset impairment
costs  related  to  certain  right  of  use  assets  and  other  assets  that  were  abandoned  in  connection  with  plans  to  improve  our  cost  structure  and  operations
prospectively.  In  addition,  during  fiscal  2019  we  recorded  certain  business  combination  related  adjustments  that  benefited  our  expenses  during  this  period.
These increases to our fiscal 2020 expenses growth were partially offset by lower fiscal 2020 transitional employee related costs.

Restructuring Expenses: restructuring  expenses  resulted  from  the  execution  of  management  approved  restructuring  plans  that  were  generally  developed  to
improve  our  cost  structure  and/or  operations,  often  in  conjunction  with  our  acquisition  integration  strategies.  restructuring  expenses  consist  of  employee
severance  costs  and  other  contract  termination  costs  to  improve  our  cost  structure  prospectively.  Prior  to  fiscal  2020,  restructuring  expenses  also  included
charges for duplicate facilities. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Annual report.

restructuring  expenses  in  fiscal  2020  and  2019  primarily related  to  our 2019  restructuring  Plan. Our  management  approved,  committed  to  and  initiated  the

periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans.

The  majority of  the  initiatives undertaken  by  our 2019  restructuring  Plan were  effected  to implement  our  continued  emphasis  in  developing,  marketing  and
selling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Cost savings that are
expected to be realized pursuant  to our 2019  restructuring  Plan initiatives may be offset by investments in resources and geographies that best address the

On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower interest income in fiscal
2020, which was primarily attributable to lower average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates
on these balances during fiscal 2020, and also due to higher fiscal 2020 foreign currency losses.

Provision  for  Income  Taxes:  Our  effective  income  tax  rates  for  each  of  the  periods  presented  were  the  result  of  the  mix  of  income  earned  in  various  tax
jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual
report  for  a  discussion  regarding  the  differences  between  the  effective  income  tax  rates  as  presented  for  the  periods  below  and  the  U.S.  federal  statutory
income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to
jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based
compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.

Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-
term senior notes in April 2020 (refer to recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting
from our net income during fiscal 2020 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash
used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to pay
dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2020, and the prospective recognition of current operating lease liabilities associated with our adoption of Topic 842
as of June 1, 2019. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are
variable.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash  and cash  equivalents  primarily  consist  of deposits  held  at major  banks,  Tier-1  commercial  paper  and
other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term
senior notes in April 2020, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2020. These cash inflows were
partially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $19.2 billion used for repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $4.5 billion of borrowings, payments
of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures.

The  amount  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  that  we  report  in  U.S.  Dollars  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  cash,  cash  equivalents  and
marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of
the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated
balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual report). As the
U.S.  Dollar  generally  strengthened  against  certain  major  international  currencies  during  fiscal  2020,  the  amount  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable
securities  that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries  decreased  on a net basis as of May 31, 2020 relative to what we would have reported  using
constant currency rates from the May 31, 2019 balance sheet date.

which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services,
hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing
costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower net income and certain cash unfavorable
changes  in  the  timing  of  payments  received  from  customers  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2020,  which  we  believe  were  attributable  to  the  unfavorable
global economic effects that resulted from COVID-19. We expect to collect substantially all of these delayed customer payments in future periods.

Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of
our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.

Net cash  provided  by  investing  activities  decreased  during  fiscal  2020  primarily  due  to  a  fiscal  2020  decrease  in  proceeds  from  the  maturities  and  sales  of
marketable securities and other investments and a fiscal 2020 increase in the purchase of marketable securities and other investments, in each case relative to
fiscal 2019.

Cash  flows  from  financing  activities: The  changes  in  cash  flows  from  financing  activities  primarily  relate  to  borrowings  and  repayments  related  to  our  debt
instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.

Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in our stock repurchases for which we
used $19.2 billion in fiscal 2020 in comparison to $36.1 billion in fiscal 2019; and our fiscal 2020 issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes (none in fiscal 2019).

Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to
analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our
competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our
performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:

Long-Term  Customer  Financing:  We  offer  certain  of  our  customers  the  option  to  acquire  licenses,  cloud  services,  hardware  and  services  offerings  through
separate  long-term  payment  contracts.  We  generally  sell  these  contracts  that  we  have  financed  for  our  customers  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to  financial
institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as
sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.0 billion in each of fiscal
2020 and 2019 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018 or approximately 19%, 17% and 25%, respectively, of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal
2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Recent Financing Activities:

Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2020, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.96 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2020, our Board of Directors declared a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 28, 2020 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July
15,  2020.  Future  declarations  of  dividends  and  the  establishment  of  future  record  and  payment  dates  are  subject  to  the  final  determination  of  our  Board  of
Directors.

Senior Notes: In April 2020, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:

•

•

•

•

•

$3.50 billion of 2.50% senior notes due April 2025;

$2.25 billion of 2.80% senior notes due April 2027;

$3.25 billion of 2.95% senior notes due April 2030;

$3.00 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2040;

$4.50 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2050; and

•

$3.50 billion of 3.85% senior notes due April 2060.

We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment
of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, we repaid $4.5 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regarding
our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.

Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019
and March 12, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As of
May 31, 2020, approximately $16.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 million
shares for $19.2 billion, 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our stock
repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our
cash  requirements  for  acquisitions  and  dividend  payments,  our  debt  repayment  obligations  or  repurchases  of  our  debt,  our  stock  price,  and  economic  and
market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

Contractual Obligations: The  contractual  obligations  presented  in  the  table  below  represent  our  estimates  of  future  payments  under  our  fixed  contractual
obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments
differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most
significant  assumptions  used  in preparing  this information  within  the context of our consolidated  financial  position,  results  of operations  and cash flows. The

•

certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they
effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOr-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of  these fixed to  variable
interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31, 2020 and are subject to change in future periods;

certain cross-currency swap agreements for our €1.25 billion 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including
annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these
senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements; and

certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for our €750 million 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt,
including  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  of  principal  at  maturity,  to  a  variable-rate,  U.S.  Dollar-denominated  debt.  Principal  and  interest  payments  for  these  senior  notes  were

Primarily  represents  amounts  associated  with  agreements  that  are  enforceable  and  legally  binding; terms  include:  fixed  or  minimum  quantities  to  be  purchased;  fixed,  minimum  or  variable  price
provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished  hardware  products.  We  also  obtain  individual  hardware  components  for  our  products  from  a  variety  of  individual  suppliers  based  on  projected  demand  information.  Such  purchase
commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for
the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our
external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in
order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.

As of May 31, 2020, we had $8.4 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance
sheet,  and  all  such  obligations  have  been  excluded  from  the  contractual  obligations  table  above  due  to  the  uncertainty  as  to  when  they  might  be  settled  or
released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal
2021. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to
the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which
are out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report includes additional information
regarding these contingencies.

We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,
capital  expenditures  and  contractual  obligation  requirements.  In  addition,  we  believe  that  we  could  fund  our  future  acquisitions,  dividend  payments  and
repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional
borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to investors.

Selected Quarterly Financial Data

The  following  tables  set  forth  selected  unaudited  quarterly  information  for  our  last  eight  fiscal  quarters.  We  believe  that  all  necessary  adjustments,  which
consisted  only  of  normal  recurring  adjustments,  have  been  included  in  the  amounts  stated  below  to  present  fairly  the  results  of  such  periods  when  read  in
conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  report.  The  sum  of  the  quarterly  financial
information may vary from annual data due to rounding. refer to “Seasonality and Cyclicality” in Item 1 and “Business Overview” in Item 7 included elsewhere
within  this  Annual  report  for  additional  information  regarding  the  seasonality  of  our  revenues,  expenses  and  margins  and  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  our
business during fiscal 2020.

Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options

Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees
and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.

We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards
granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2017 has been a
weighted-average annualized rate of 1.5% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards
and  stock  options  granted  and  assumed,  net  of restricted  stock-based  awards  and  stock  options  forfeited  by employees  leaving  the  company,  divided  by  the
weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and
stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2020, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, substantially all have exercise
prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of
our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including
the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2020, the
maximum  potential  dilution  from  all  outstanding  restricted  stock-based  awards  and  unexercised  stock  options,  regardless  of  when  granted  and  regardless  of
whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.0%.

During fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to
selected  employees;  all  stock-based  award  grants  to  senior  officers;  and  any  individual  grant  of  restricted  stock  units  of  62,500  or  greater.  The  annual
organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day period
following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. However, we currently do not expect that the annual grant
for  fiscal  2021  will  be  approved  during  this  time  period.  Each  member  of  a  separate  executive  officer  committee,  referred  to  as  the  Plan  Committee,  was
allocated a fiscal 2020 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations
established by the Compensation Committee.

Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $43.1 billion and $37.8 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our bank deposits and time
deposits  are  generally  held  with  large,  diverse  financial  institutions  worldwide  with  high  investment-grade  credit  ratings  or  financial  institutions  that  meet
investment-grade  ratings  criteria,  which  we  believe  mitigates  credit  risk  and  certain  other  risks.  In  addition,  as  of  May  31,  2020,  substantially  all  of  our
marketable securities were high quality with substantially all having maturity dates within one year (a description of our marketable securities held is included in
Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report and “Liquidity and Capital resources” above). We held a
mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. Fixed rate securities may have their market values adversely impacted as interest rates increase, while floating
rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may vary due to changes
in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we
classify  our  debt  securities  as  “available  for  sale,”  no  gains  or  losses  are  recognized  due  to  changes  in  interest  rates  unless  such  securities  are  sold  prior  to
maturity  or  declines  in  fair  value  are  determined  to  be  other-than-temporary.  The  fair  values  of  our  fixed-rate  debt  securities  are  impacted  by  interest  rate
movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31, 2020 and 2019 we estimate the change would have decreased
the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $15 million and $128 million, respectively. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes.

Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal
2020  and  2019,  total  interest  income  was  $527  million  and  $1.1  billion,  respectively,  with  our  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  investments
yielding an average 1.47% and 2.08%, respectively, on a worldwide basis.

Interest Expense Risk

Interest Expense Risk—Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements

Our total borrowings were $71.6 billion as of May 31, 2020, consisting of $71.5 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings. As of May
31, 2020, we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our $1.5 billion
of 2.80% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes), so that the fixed-rate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based
on LIBOr. We have also entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our €750
million of 3.125% fixed-rate senior notes due July 2025 Notes (July 2025 Notes) by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated debt, including the
annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOr. The critical terms of the swap
agreements  match  the  critical  terms  of  the  July  2021  Notes  and  July  2025  Notes  that  the  swap  agreements  pertain  to,  including  the  notional  amounts  and
maturity dates. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes. We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to
ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The fair values of our outstanding fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2020 and 2019
were a $12 million net gain and a $17 million net loss, respectively. We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements as of May 31, 2020
and 2019, respectively, were primarily attributable to a decrease and increase, respectively, in forward interest rate prices. If LIBOr-based interest rates would
have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31, 2020 and 2019,  the change would have decreased  the collective fair values of the fixed to variable swap
agreements by $63 million and $90 million, respectively.

By  entering  into  the  aforementioned  swap  arrangements,  we  have  assumed  risks  associated  with  variable  interest  rates  based  upon  LIBOr.  Changes  in  the
overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of May 31, 2020
and  2019,  if  LIBOr-based  interest  rates  would  have  been  higher  by  100  basis  points,  the  change  would  have  increased  our  interest  expense  annually  by
approximately $24 million and $52 million, respectively, as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and related borrowings, and as of
May 31, 2019, as it related to our floating-rate borrowings. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7
and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.

Currency Risk

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks
associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that
increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and
volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from
intercompany  sublicense  fees,  intercompany  loans  and  other  intercompany  transactions.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  generally  short-term  in
duration.

We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to
ASC 815. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair
values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, amounts recorded generally are not significant.
The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized
gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for

60

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

changes in fair values of these forward contracts is non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.

We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward
contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions
that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency
forward contracts and other factors. The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international
currencies were $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars
in  exchange  for  other  major  international  currencies  were  $3.9  billion  and  $3.3  billion  as  of  May  31,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  The  fair  values  of  our
outstanding  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  were  nominal  at  May  31,  2020  and  2019.  Net  foreign  exchange  transaction  losses  included  in  non-operating
income,  net  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations  were  $185  million  and  $111  million in  fiscal  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  As  a  large
portion  of  our  consolidated  operations  are  international,  we  could  experience  additional  foreign  currency  volatility  in  the  future,  the  amounts  and  timing  of
which are unknown.

Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Fluctuations  in  foreign  currencies  impact  the  amount  of  total  assets  and  liabilities  that  we  report  for  our  foreign  subsidiaries  upon  the  translation  of  these
amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of
the  cash  held  by  these  subsidiaries  is  subject  to  translation  variance  caused  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  as  of  the  end  of  each  respective
reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated
statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual report).

As the U.S. Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2020, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2020 decreased relative to what we would have reported
using a constant currency rate from May 31, 2019. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on
our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in U.S. Dollars was a decrease of $125 million and $158 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. If overall
foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019 the amount of
cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  we  would  report  in  U.S.  Dollars  would  have  decreased  by  approximately  $491  million  and  $434  million,
respectively, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our
Disclosure  Committee  and  our  management,  including  our  Principal  Executive  and  Financial  Officer,  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of  our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).

Index to Financial Statements

Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report,
our Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2020 to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our  Principal
Executive and Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act rules
13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f).  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  our  Principal  Executive  and  Financial  Officer,  we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020 based on the guidelines established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 framework. Our internal control over
financial  reporting  includes  policies  and  procedures  that  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Based  on  the  results  of  our  evaluation,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  May  31,  2020.  We
reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual report.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act
rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting  are  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  of  achieving  their  objectives  and  are  effective  at  the  reasonable  assurance  level.  However,  our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are
met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their  costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all  control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  controls  can  provide  absolute  assurance  that  all  control  issues  and
instances  of  fraud,  if  any,  have  been  detected.  These  inherent  limitations  include  the  realities  that  judgments  in  decision-making  can  be  faulty  and  that
breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of
the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Oracle Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation (the Company) as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2020, the related notes and the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  May  31,  2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 22, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company’s  financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted  our audits in accordance with the  standards of the  PCAOB. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included
evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to
be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on
the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Description of the
matter

Legal Contingencies

As discussed in Note 17 of the financial statements, the Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings. The Company
accrues  a liability for  an estimated  loss  if the  potential  loss from  any  claim or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the
amount can be reasonably estimated. For purposes of disclosure, the Company also performs an assessment of the materiality of
legal contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that an exposure to loss exists in excess of
the amount accrued.

The  audit  of  the  Company’s  accounting  for  and  disclosure  of  legal  contingencies  is  highly  subjective  and  requires  significant
judgment in assessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss.  These
judgments are impacted by uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of the legal contingencies, the status of the litigation or
the appeals processes, and the status of any settlement discussions associated with the legal contingencies.

How we addressed the
matter in our audit

  We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the identification
and evaluation of these matters, including controls over management’s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss and
whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable.

Our substantive audit procedures, among others, included gaining an understanding of the status of ongoing lawsuits, reviewing
letters  addressing  the  matters  from  internal  and  external  legal  counsel,  meetings  with  internal  legal  counsel  to  discuss  the
allegations,  and  obtaining  a  representation  letter  from  management  on  these  matters.  We  also  evaluated  the  Company’s
disclosures in relation to these matters.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

We have audited Oracle Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated
Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)  (the  COSO  criteria).  In  our  opinion,  Oracle
Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2020, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 and our
report June 22, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s report on Internal Control Over Financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our  audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and
evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Oracle  Corporation  provides  products  and  services  that  substantially  address  all  aspects  of  enterprise  information  technology  (IT)  environments,  including
applications  and  infrastructure.  We  deliver  our  products  and  services  to  customers  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and  interoperable  IT  deployment
models, including cloud-based, Cloud at Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer’s own data center), on premise and hybrid models. Oracle Cloud
Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (SaaS and IaaS, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide a comprehensive and
integrated  stack  of  applications  and  infrastructure  services  delivered  via  cloud-based  deployment  models  that  Oracle  deploys,  hosts,  upgrades,  supports  and
manages for the customer. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based
or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers
with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that
purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product
repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer
utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.

Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in
June 1977.

Basis of Financial Statements

The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions
of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle’s stockholders for all
periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have
not  been  presented  separately  and  instead  are  included  as  a  component  of  non-operating  income,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

In fiscal 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance: ASU 2017-13,
ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20 and ASU 2019-01 (collectively, Topic 842). Topic 842 requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet,
operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use (rOU) assets. We adopted this new standard using the effective date of June 1, 2019 as
our initial application date. Consequently, financial information for the comparative periods was not updated. We elected the package of practical expedients
permitted under the transition guidance of the new standard, which allows us to carry forward our historical lease classification. The adoption of Topic 842 did
not  result  in  a  cumulative  catch-up  adjustment  to  the  opening  of  our  accumulated  deficit  balance  as  of  June  1,  2019.  There  was  no  material  impact  to  our
consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended May 31, 2020 due to the adoption of Topic 842. refer to
the “Leases” section below for a description of our accounting policy that we have applied since our adoption of Topic 842.

Use of Estimates

Our  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  set  forth  in  the  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board’s  (FASB)  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC),  and  we  consider  the  various  staff  accounting  bulletins  and  other  applicable
guidance  issued  by  the  SEC.  These  accounting  principles  require  us  to  make  certain  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the  estimates,
judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon

74

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods
presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements
will  be  affected.  In  many  cases,  the  accounting  treatment  of  a  particular  transaction  is  specifically  dictated  by  GAAP  and  does  not  require  management’s
judgment  in  its  application.  There  are  also  areas  in  which  management’s  judgment  in  selecting  among  available  alternatives  would  not  produce  a  materially
different result.

Revenue Recognition

Our sources of revenues include:

•

•

•

cloud and license revenues, which include the sale of: cloud services and license support; and cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, which typically
represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments;

hardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage products, and industry-
specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and

services revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting, advanced customer services
and education services.

License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our
customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches
released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support
personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers
elect to renew their license support contracts annually.

Cloud  services  revenues  include  revenues  from  Oracle  Cloud  Services  offerings,  which  deliver  applications  and  infrastructure  technologies  via  cloud-based
deployment  models  that  we  develop  functionality  for,  provide  unspecified  updates  and  enhancements  for,  host,  manage,  upgrade  and  support  and  that
customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are
designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for customer cloud-based, on-premise or other IT
infrastructure for a fee for a stated term.

Cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  revenues  primarily  represent  amounts  earned  from  granting  customers  perpetual  licenses  to  use  our  database,
middleware,  application  and  industry-specific  software  products,  which  our  customers  use  for  cloud-based,  on-premise  and  other  IT  environments.  The  vast
majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.

revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage,
and  industry-specific  hardware.  Our  hardware  support  offerings  generally  provide  customers  with  software  updates  for  the  software  components  that  are
essential to the  functionality of the  hardware products  purchased  and  can  also include  product  repairs, maintenance  services and  technical support  services.
Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.

Our services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting
services  are  designed  to  help  our  customers  to,  among  others,  deploy,  architect,  integrate,  upgrade  and  secure  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  and
infrastructure

75

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

technologies. Our advanced customer services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and
services.  We  offer  these  advanced  customer  services  to  Oracle  customers  to  enable  increased  performance  and  higher  availability  of  Oracle products  and
services. Education services include instructor-led, media-based and internet-based training in the use of our cloud, software and hardware products.

We apply the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) as a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our
cloud, license, hardware and services arrangements and generally requires revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services
provided  to  our  customers,  reflecting  the  amount  of  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  for  those  goods  or  services.  Pursuant  to  ASC  606, revenues  are
recognized upon the application of the following steps:

•

•

•

•

•

identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

determination of the transaction price;

allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

recognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.

Our customers  that  we contract  with for the  provision  of cloud  services,  software, hardware  or other services include  businesses  of  many sizes, government
agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.

The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts
receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets
when revenues are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for
cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the
customer of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS and IaaS
contracts  are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance.  Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed.  Most
contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed
through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating income,
net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.

Our  revenue  arrangements  generally  include  standard  warranty  or  service  level  provisions  that  our  arrangements  will  perform  and  operate  in  all  material
respects  as  defined  in  the  respective  agreements,  the  financial  impacts  of  which  have  historically been  and  are  expected  to  continue  to  be  insignificant.  Our
arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected
from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services

revenues  from  cloud  services  provided  on  a  subscription  basis  are  generally  recognized  ratably  over  the  contractual  period  that  the  services  are  delivered,
beginning on the date our service is made available to our customers. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits
of the cloud services throughout  the contract period. revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are
generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer.

76

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support

Oracle’s  primary  performance  obligations  with  respect  to  license  support  contracts  and  hardware  support  contracts  are  to  provide  customers  with  technical
support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period, if and when they are
available. Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, revenues for
license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided.

Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and On-Premise License

revenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is
made available to the customer to download and use. revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are
recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, the
minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer.

Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products

The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a
combined  performance  obligation.  The  revenues  for  this  combined  performance  obligation  are  generally  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  that  the  hardware
product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer.

Revenue Recognition for Services

Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying
input methods to estimate progress to completion. revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed.

Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations

Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracle
products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not
combined.  We  allocate  the  transaction  price  for  each  contract  to  each  performance  obligation  based  on  the  relative  standalone  selling  price  (SSP)  for  each
performance obligation within each contract.

We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses,
we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We
typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licenses
and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at
the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer
to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are
sold  for  a  broad  range  of  amounts  (that  is,  the  selling  price  is  highly  variable)  and  a  representative  SSP  is  not  discernible  from  past  transactions  or  other
observable  evidence.  As  a  result,  the  SSP  for  a  cloud  license  and  an  on-premise  license  included  in  a  contract  with  multiple  performance  obligations  is
determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance

77

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price
allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.

Remaining Performance Obligations from Customer Contracts

Trade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated
balance sheets as of May 31, 2020 and 2019. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, that were included
in  the  opening  deferred  revenues  balance  as of May  31,  2019  and  2018,  respectively,  was approximately $8.4  billion and  $8.3  billion, respectively. revenues
recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended
May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been
issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future
periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In
each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first
fiscal  quarter.  These  seasonal  impacts  influence  how  our  remaining  performance  obligations  change  over  time  and,  combined  with  foreign  exchange  rate
fluctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2020, our remaining
performance obligations were $37.0 billion, approximately 62% of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months and the remainder
thereafter.

Sales of Financing Receivables

We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment
contracts.  We  generally  sell  these  contracts  that  we  have  financed  for  our  customers  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to  financial  institutions  within  90  days  of  the
contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are
considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively,
of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.

Business Combinations

We  apply  the  provisions  of  ASC  805,  Business  Combinations (ASC  805),  in  accounting  for  our  acquisitions.  ASC  805  requires  that  we  evaluate  whether  a
transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable
of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition
to  the  individual  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  on  a  relative  fair  value  basis;  whereas  the  acquisition  of  a  business  requires  us  to  recognize  separately  from
goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess
of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates
and  assumptions  to  accurately  value  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  business  acquisition  date  as  well  as  any  contingent  consideration,  where
applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the
business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of
a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any

78

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our
internal  operations  are  accounted  for  as  termination  and  exit  costs  pursuant  to  ASC  420,  Exit  or  Disposal  Cost  Obligations (ASC  420) , and  are  accounted  for
separately  from  the  business  combination.  A  liability  for  costs  associated  with  an  exit  or  disposal  activity  is  recognized  and  measured  at  its  fair  value  in  our
consolidated  statement  of  operations  in  the  period  in  which  the  liability  is  incurred.  Prior  to  June  1,  2019,  we  accounted  for  operating  lease  abandonment
pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  ASC  420.  Effective  June  1,  2019,  abandoned  operating  leases  related  to  an  acquired  company  or  our  internal  operations  are
accounted for as rOU asset impairment charges pursuant to Topic 842 and are accounted for separately from the business combination. In all periods presented,
when estimating the asset impairment charges, assumptions were applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ from actual
results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.

For a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of
these  pre-acquisition  contingencies  throughout  the  measurement  period  in  order  to  obtain  sufficient  information  to  assess  whether  we  include  these
contingencies  as  a  part  of  the  fair  value  estimates  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  and,  if  so,  to  determine  their  estimated  amounts.  If  we  cannot
reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case
given  the  nature  of  such  matters,  we  will  recognize  an  asset  or  a  liability  for  such  pre-acquisition  contingency  if:  (1)  it  is  probable  that  an  asset  existed  or  a
liability  had  been  incurred  at  the  business  acquisition  date  and  (2)  the  amount  of  the  asset  or  liability  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Subsequent  to  the
measurement  period  or  final  determination  of  the  net  asset  values  for  the  business  combination,  changes  in  our  estimates  of  such  contingencies  will  affect
earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.

In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We
reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary
estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax
allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our
provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities

In accordance with ASC 320, Investments—Debt and Equity Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all of
our  marketable  debt  securities  as  available-for-sale.  We  carry  these  securities  at  fair  value,  and  report  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses,  net  of  taxes,  as  a
component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record within non-operating income, net in
the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  We  periodically  evaluate  our  investments  to  determine  if  impairment  charges  are  required.
Substantially  all  of  our  marketable  debt  investments  are  classified  as  current  based  on  the  nature  of  the  investments  and  their  availability for  use  in  current
operations.

Investments in equity securities, other than any equity method investments, are recorded at fair value, if fair value is readily determinable. We hold investments
in certain non-marketable equity securities with no readily determinable fair values in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. We
measure these equity securities at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments
of  the  same  issuer.  Our  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  included  in  other  non-current  assets  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  are
subject to periodic impairment reviews.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

We apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to
other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments.

The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

We  record  allowances  for  doubtful  accounts  based  upon  a  specific  review  of  all  significant  outstanding  invoices.  For  those  invoices  not  specifically  reviewed,
provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable
was recorded in and current economic trends. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection
efforts without success.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives
and trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to
any single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities.
Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses in
these  contracts  is  largely  mitigated  with  collateral  security  agreements  that  provide  for  collateral  to  be  received  or  posted  when  the  net  fair  values  of  these
contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade
receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer
contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.

We outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the
U.S. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where
these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our
hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out
basis.  We  evaluate  our  ending  inventories  for  estimated  excess  quantities  and  obsolescence.  This  evaluation  includes  analysis  of  sales  levels  by  product  and
projections of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged
to hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete.
At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the
restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance
sheets and totaled $211 million and $320 million at May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Other Receivables

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

Other receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables are
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $778 million and $776 million at May 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

Deferred Sales Commissions

We defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support and
hardware support contract. Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line
basis  over  a  period  of  benefit  that  we  estimate  to  be  four  to  five  years.  We  determine  the  period  of  benefit  by  taking  into  consideration  the  historical  and
expected durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating
to  our  cloud-based  arrangements  are  generally  deferred  and  then  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  related  contractual  renewal  period,  which  is
generally  one  to  three  years.  Amortization  of  deferred  sales  commissions  is  included  as  a  component  of  sales  and  marketing  expenses  in  our  consolidated
statements of operations.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-
line  method  based  on  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets,  which  range  from  one  to  40  years.  Leasehold  improvements  are  amortized  over  the  lesser  of  the
estimated  useful  lives  of  the  improvements  or  the  lease  terms,  as  appropriate.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  periodically  reviewed  for  impairment
whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  We  did  not  recognize  any  significant
property impairment charges in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments

Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  the  purchase  price  in  a  business  combination  over  the  fair  value  of  net  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired.  Intangible
assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. Each period we
evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining
periods of amortization.

The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed for
impairment,  we  have  the  option  to  perform  an  assessment  of  qualitative  factors  of  impairment  (optional  assessment)  prior  to  necessitating  a  quantitative
impairment  test.  Should  the  optional  assessment  be  used  for  any  given  fiscal  year,  qualitative  factors  to  consider  for  a  reporting  unit  include:  cost  factors;
financial  performance;  legal,  regulatory,  contractual,  political,  business,  or  other  factors;  entity  specific  factors;  industry  and  market  considerations;
macroeconomic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely
than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For
those  reporting  units  tested  using  a  quantitative  approach,  we  compare  the  fair  value  of  each  reporting  unit  with  the  carrying  amount  of  the  reporting  unit,
including goodwill. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the
reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis; future economic and market
conditions; and market comparables of peer companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than
the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting

unit. Our most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1, 2020 and did not result in a goodwill impairment charge. We did not recognize
impairment charges in fiscal 2019 or 2018.

recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is
expected to generate. recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the
asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired
asset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our finite lived
intangible  assets  and  may  adjust  the  period  over  which  these  assets  are  amortized  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  a  shorter
amortization period is more reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments

During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 10 below for additional
information). We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and
Hedging (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of
each  reporting  date.  ASC  815  also  requires  that  changes  in  our  derivatives’  fair  values  be  recognized  in  earnings,  unless  specific  hedge  accounting  and
documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges).

The  accounting  for  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  a  derivative  depends  on  the  intended  use  of  the  derivative  and  the  resulting  designation.  For  a  derivative
instrument  designated  as  a  fair  value  hedge,  loss  or  gain  attributable  to  the  risk  being  hedged  is  recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  of  change  with  a
corresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged.

For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change in fair value of the derivative to accumulated other
comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance sheets, and the change is reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings.

Leases

As referenced above, our accounting policy for leases under ASC 842 was prospectively effective for us as of June 1, 2019. We determine if an arrangement is a
lease at its inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of
future payments, because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not known. right of Use (rOU) assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at
lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives. Our lease terms that are
used in determining our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we
will exercise such options. We amortize our rOU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the
lease  amortization  and  imputed  interest  as  operating  expenses.  We  have  lease  agreements  with  lease  and  non-lease  components,  and  in  such  cases,  we
generally account for the components as a single lease component. We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term
of less than one year.

rOU assets related to our operating leases are included in other non-current assets, short-term operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities,
and  long-term  operating  lease  liabilities are  included  in  other  non-current  liabilities in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Cash  flow  movements  related  to  our
lease  activities  are  included  in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  assets  and  accounts  payable  and  other  liabilities  as  presented  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating
activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended May 31, 2020.

Legal and Other Contingencies

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial
exposure.  Descriptions  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  contingencies  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  are  provided  under  “Business
Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for an
estimated  loss  if  the  potential  loss  from  any  claim  or  legal  proceeding  is  considered  probable,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Note  17  below
provides additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Our shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for all periods presented.

Foreign Currency

We  transact  business  in  various  foreign  currencies.  In  general,  the  functional  currency  of  a  foreign  operation  is  the  local  country’s  currency.  Consequently,
revenues  and  expenses  of  operations  outside  the  U.S.  are  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  using  weighted-average  exchange  rates  while  assets  and  liabilities  of
operations  outside  the  U.S.  are  translated  into  U.S.  Dollars  using  exchange  rates  at  the  balance  sheet  dates.  The  effects  of  foreign  currency  translation
adjustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCL in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are
summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income,
net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $185 million, $111 million and $74 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

We  account  for  share-based  payments  to  employees,  including  grants  of  service-based  restricted  stock  unit  awards,  performance-based  restricted  stock  unit
awards  (PSUs),  service-based  employee  stock  options,  performance-based  stock  options  (PSOs),  and  purchases  under  employee  stock  purchase  plans  in
accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized
in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.

For  our  service-based  stock  awards,  we  recognize  stock-based  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  service  period  of  the  award,  which  is
generally four years.

For our PSUs and PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived, explicit or implicit service period
(which is the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied). During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensation
expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that
result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock-
based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of
shares  that  are  expected  to  vest  are  reflected  in  the  amount  of  stock-based  compensation  expense  that  we  recognize  for  each  PSU  or  PSO  tranche  on  a
cumulative  catch  up  basis  during  each  interim  reporting  period  in  which  such  estimates  are  altered.  Changes  in  estimates  of  the  implicit  service  periods  are
recognized prospectively.

We  record  deferred  tax  assets  for  stock-based  compensation  awards  that  result  in  deductions  on  certain  of  our  income  tax  returns  based  on  the  amount  of
stock-based compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with
a business combination

at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards
that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised
with  any  shortfall/windfall  relative  to  the  deferred  tax  asset  established  recorded  as  a  discrete  detriment/benefit  to  our  provision  for  income  taxes  in  such
period.

Advertising

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $178 million, $169 million
and $138 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Research and Development Costs and Software Development Costs

All research and development costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Software development costs required to
be  capitalized  under  ASC  985-20,  Costs  of  Software  to  be  Sold,  Leased  or  Marketed, and  under  ASC  350-40,  Internal-Use  Software,  were  not  material  to  our
consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Acquisition Related and Other Expenses

Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation for transitional and certain other employees, certain
business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.

Income Taxes

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of
temporary  differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  amounts  recognized  for  income  tax  purposes.  We
record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.

A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
The  first  step  is  to  determine  if  the  weight  of  available  evidence  indicates  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  tax  position  will  be  sustained  in  an  audit,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our
consolidated statements of operations.

A  description  of  our  accounting  policies  associated  with  tax  related  contingencies  and  valuation  allowances  assumed  as  a  part  of  a  business  combination  is
provided under “Business Combinations” above.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Financial Instruments: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting (ASU  2020-04).  ASU  2020-04  provides  optional  guidance  for  contract  modifications  and  certain  hedging  relationships  associated  with  the
transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are
still evaluating the impact, but do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In  January  2020,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2020-01,  Investments—Equity  Securities  (Topic  321),  Investments—Equity  Method  and  Joint  Ventures  (Topic  323),  and
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU 2020-01). ASU 2020-01 clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting
for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. ASU 2020-01 is effective for us
in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2022,  and  earlier adoption  is  permitted.  We  are  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  our  pending  adoption  of  ASU  2020-01  on  our
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-
13) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 326). Topic 326 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit
losses for financial assets held. We will adopt Topic 326 effective June 1, 2020 with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to accumulated
deficit. We currently do not expect that our pending adoption of Topic 326 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes:  In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which is
intended to simplify various areas related to the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application of Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 is effective for us
beginning in fiscal 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2019-12 on our consolidated
financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS

Fiscal 2018 Acquisition of Aconex Limited

On March 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Aconex Limited (Aconex), a provider of cloud-based collaboration software for construction projects. We
have included the financial results of Aconex in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. These results were not individually material to
our

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

consolidated financial statements. The total purchase price for Aconex was approximately $1.2 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.2 billion in cash and
$7 million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, we
recorded approximately $873 million of goodwill, $377 million of identifiable intangible  assets,  and $29 million of net liabilities.  Goodwill generated from our
acquisition of Aconex was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is tax deductible.

Other Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 Acquisitions

During  fiscal  2020,  2019  and  2018,  we  acquired  certain  other  companies  and  purchased  certain  technology  and  development  assets  primarily  to  expand  our
products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, money market funds and other securities
with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other
securities.

The amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2020 and 2019. We use the
specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realized
gains  and  losses  were  insignificant  for  fiscal  2020,  2019  and  2018.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  components  of  our  cash  equivalents  and  marketable
securities held, substantially all of which were classified as available-for-sale:

purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

We perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets
and  liabilities  required  to  be  recorded  at  their  fair  values,  we  consider  the  principal  or  most  advantageous  market  in  which  we  would  transact  and  consider
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

•

•

•

Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level  2:  inputs  other  than  Level  1  that  are  observable,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  such  as  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  similar  assets  or
liabilities,  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  assets  or  liabilities  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  or  other  inputs  that  are  observable  or  can  be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or

Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Our  marketable  securities  investments  consist  of  Tier  1  commercial  paper  debt  securities,  corporate  debt  securities  and  certain  other  securities.  Marketable
securities as presented per our consolidated balance sheets included securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months and
the remainder of the securities were included in cash and cash equivalents. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our instruments that
were  classified  as  Level  1  in  the  table  above  were  derived  from  quoted  market  prices  and  active  markets  for  these  instruments  that  exist.  Our  valuation
techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derived
from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or
pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques,

We entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effects of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with the 2.25% senior notes that were due and were settled
in October 2019 (October 2019 Notes) and the 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOr. The effective
interest rates after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements were 3.07% as of May 31, 2019 for the October 2019 Notes, and 1.99% and 3.22%, respectively, for the July
2021 Notes as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges associated with our July 2021 Notes and to our Annual report for
the year ended May 31, 2019 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges associated with our October 2019 Notes.

In July 2013, we issued €2.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of €1.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and €750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July
2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes in the table above were calculated using foreign
currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt,
including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 10 for
additional information).

In  fiscal  2018  we  entered  into  certain  cross-currency  interest  rate  swap  agreements  that  have  the  economic  effect  of  converting  our  fixed-rate,  Euro-denominated  debt,  including  annual  interest
payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $871 million based on LIBOr. The effective interest rates as of May 31, 2020 and 2019 after
consideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements were 4.46% and 5.74%, respectively, for the July 2025 Notes. refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair value
hedges.

In  April  2020,  we  issued  $20.0  billion  of  senior  notes  for  general  corporate  purposes,  which  may  include  stock  repurchases,  payment  of  cash  dividends  on  our  common  stock  and  repayment  of
indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the
payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.

Future principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency swap agreements associated with the January 2021 Notes and July 2025 Notes) for all of
our borrowings at May 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions):

The senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding
our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the
subsidiaries  of  Oracle  Corporation  are  or  will  be  effectively  senior  to  the  senior  notes  and  any  future  issuances  of  commercial  paper  notes.  We  were  in

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan

During fiscal 2019, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our
acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2019 restructuring Plan). restructuring costs associated with the 2019 restructuring Plan were recorded to
the  restructuring  expense  line  item  within  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  as  they  were  incurred.  We  recorded  $261  million  and  $476  million  of
restructuring expenses in connection with the 2019 restructuring Plan in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to incur the majority of the estimated
remaining $105 million of restructuring expenses in fiscal 2021. Any changes to the estimates or timing of executing the 2019 restructuring Plan will be reflected
in our future results of operations.

Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan

During fiscal 2017, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our
acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2017 restructuring Plan). restructuring costs associated with the 2017 restructuring Plan were recorded to
the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred. We recorded $601 million of restructuring expenses
in connection with the 2017 restructuring Plan in fiscal 2018. Actions pursuant to the 2017 restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of May 31, 2018.

Deferred cloud services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud or
support  contracts  that  are  typically  billed  in  advance  with  corresponding  revenues  generally  being  recognized  ratably  over  the  contractual  periods.  Deferred
services  revenues  include  prepayments  for  our  services  business  and  revenues  for  these  services  are  generally  recognized  as  the  services  are  performed.
Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specified
enhancements.

In  connection  with  our  acquisitions,  we  have  estimated  the  fair  values  of  the  cloud  services  and  license  support  performance  obligations  assumed  from  our
acquired  companies.  We  generally  have  estimated  the  fair  values  of  these  obligations  assumed  using  a  cost  build-up  approach.  The  cost  build-up  approach
determines  fair  value  by  estimating  the  costs  related  to  fulfilling  the  obligations  plus  a  normal  profit  margin.  The  sum  of  the  costs  and  operating  profit
approximates,  in  theory,  the  amount  that  we  would  be  required  to  pay  a  third  party  to  assume  these  acquired  obligations.  These  aforementioned  fair  value
adjustments  recorded  for  obligations  assumed  from  our  acquisitions  reduced  the  cloud  services  and  license  support  deferred  revenues  balances  that  we
recorded  as  liabilities  from  these  acquisitions  and  also  reduced  the  resulting  revenues  that  we  recognized  or  will  recognize  over  the  terms  of  the  acquired
obligations during the post-combination periods. refer to Note 15 for additional information.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value Hedges—Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements

In May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July
2025  Notes  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro  denominated  2025  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  of  principal  at
maturity,  to  variable-rate,  U.S.  Dollar  denominated  debt  based  on  LIBOr.  In  July  2014,  we  entered  into  certain  interest  rate  swap  agreements  that  have  the
economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively
became variable based on LIBOr. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes that the swap
agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates.

We have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC
815. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2025 Notes are recognized as interest expense and
non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in non-current assets or non-current liabilities
in our consolidated balance sheets.

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

The  changes  in  fair  values  of  our  interest  rate  swap  agreements  associated  with  our  July  2021  Notes  are  recognized  as  interest  expense  in  our  consolidated
statements  of  operations  with  the  corresponding  amounts  included  in  other  non-current  assets  or  other  non-current  liabilities  in  our  consolidated  balance
sheets.  The  amount  of  net  gain  (loss)  attributable  to  the  interest  rate  risk  being  hedged  is  recognized  as  interest  expense  and  amount  of  net  gain  (loss)
attributable to the foreign exchange risk being hedged, as applicable, is recognized as non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations
with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, current or notes payable, non-current. We exclude the portion of the change in fair value of cross-
currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the related cross-currency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in fair value
of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the cross-currency basis spread is included in AOCL. The periodic interest settlements for
the  swap  agreements  for  the  July  2025  Notes  and  July  2021  Notes  are recorded  as interest  expense  and  are included  as a part  of  cash  flows  from  operating
activities  and,  for  the  swap  agreements  associated  with  the  July  2025  Notes,  the  cash  flows  that  pertain  to  the  principal  balance  are  classified  as  financing
activities.

Cash Flow Hedges—Cross-Currency Swap Agreements

In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency
exchange  risk  by  effectively  converting  the  fixed-rate,  Euro-denominated  January  2021  Notes,  including  the  annual  interest  payments  and  the  payment  of
principal at maturity,  to fixed-rate, U.S.  Dollar-denominated debt.  The  economic  effect  of the  swap  agreements  was to eliminate the  uncertainty  of the  cash
flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest
rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges
pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments
being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.

We used the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swap
agreements are recognized as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the gains or losses on the effective
portion  of  these  cross-currency  swap  agreements  in  AOCL  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  an  amount  is  reclassified  out  of  AOCL  into  non-operating
income, net in the same period that the carrying values of the Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized.
The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash
flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges

We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks
associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that
increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and
volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from
intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany  loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in  the near term. Our
foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally
depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those
rates, the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.

We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the
end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balance
sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current
liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is
non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.

As  of  May  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  notional  amounts  of  the  forward  contracts  we  held  to  purchase  U.S.  Dollars  in  exchange  for  other  major  international
currencies were $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major
international currencies were $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at
May 31, 2020 and 2019. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities.

LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES

Leases

We have operating leases that primarily relate to certain of our facilities, data centers and vehicles. As of May 31, 2020, our operating leases substantially have
remaining terms of one year to twelve years, some of which include options to extend and/or terminate the leases.

For fiscal 2020, operating lease expenses totaled $599 million, net of sublease income of $16 million. At May 31, 2020, rOU assets, current lease liabilities and
non-current  lease  liabilities  for  our  operating  leases  were  $2.0  billion,  $575  million  and  $1.5  billion,  respectively.  We  recorded  rOU  assets  of  $2.8  billion  in
exchange for operating lease obligations during the year ended May 31, 2020, which included $1.9 billion for operating leases existing on June 1, 2019 that were
recognized upon our initial adoption of Topic 842 and $849 million for operating leases that were contracted during fiscal 2020. Cash paid for amounts included
in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $663 million for year ended May 31, 2020. As of May 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term
for operating leases was approximately six years and the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligations was 3.2%. As of May 31,
2020, we have $411 million of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data centers, that commence in fiscal 2021 for terms of one to ten years
that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2020 or in the maturities table below.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable and
legally  binding  and  specify  terms,  including:  fixed  or  minimum  quantities  to  be  purchased;  fixed,  minimum  or  variable  price  provisions;  and  the  approximate
timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and
testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected
demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment
within  agreed  upon  lead-times  and/or  commercially  standard  lead-times  for  the  particular  part  or  product  and  have  been  included  in  the  amounts  disclosed
below. routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered
into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated
terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.

As of May 31, 2020, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions):

As described in Notes 7 and 10 above, as of May 31, 2020 we have senior notes and other borrowings that mature at various future dates and derivative financial
instruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.

Guarantees

Our cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a
third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material
liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions

98

Table of Contents

Index to Financial Statements

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

indemnifying  customers  against  liabilities  in  the  event  we  breach  confidentiality  or  service  level  requirements.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum
potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement.

Our Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreement
during the service period. Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the
applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with
industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.

We occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, among
others, guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a
material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In  connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds  with a court and  entered  into related indemnification agreements  with
each of the surety bond issuing companies. Additional information is provided in Note 17 below.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Common Stock Repurchases

Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019 and March 12, 2020, we announced
that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As of May 31, 2020, approximately $16.6
billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion, 733.8 million
shares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.

Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital
needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic
and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

Dividends on Common Stock

During  fiscal  2020,  2019  and  2018,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  cash  dividends  of  $0.96,  $0.81  and  $0.76  per  share  of  our  outstanding  common  stock,
respectively, which we paid during the same period.

In June 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 28,
2020 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2020. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment
dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.

In  fiscal 2001,  we  adopted  the  2000  Long-Term  Equity  Incentive  Plan, which  provides  for the  issuance  of long-term  performance  awards, including  restricted
stock-based  awards,  non-qualified  stock  options  and  incentive  stock  options,  as  well  as  stock  purchase  rights  and  stock  appreciation  rights,  to  our  eligible
employees, officers and directors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers.

In  fiscal  2011,  our  stockholders,  upon  the  recommendation  of  our  Board  of  Directors  (the  Board),  approved  the  adoption  of  the  Amended  and
restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and increased the
number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares.

In fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock
that may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in the
form of restricted stock units (rSUs) and performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs). For each share granted as a full value award under the
2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.

In fiscal 2018, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock
that  may  be  issued  under  the  2000  Plan  by  330,000,000  shares,  and  approved  material  terms  of  the  performance  goals  under  which  PSUs  and
performance-based stock options (PSOs) could be granted.

As of May 31, 2020, the 2000 Plan had 97 million unvested rSUs outstanding, 54 million PSOs outstanding and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase 120
million shares of common stock outstanding of which 112 million shares were vested. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 212 million shares of common stock
were available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.
The 2000 Plan is scheduled to expire on the date of Oracle’s annual meeting of stockholders in November 2020.

The vesting schedule for all awards granted under the 2000 Plan is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. rSUs generally require
service-based vesting of 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs currently requires achieving performance targets and providing service over
four fiscal years. SOs are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10
years  from  the  date  of  grant.  PSOs  granted  to our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Technology  Officer  in fiscal  2018  consist  of seven  numerically  equivalent
vesting tranches that potentially may

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

vest. One tranche vests solely on the attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six tranches require the attainment of both a performance metric and
a market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capitalization metrics for the PSOs may be achieved at
any time during a five year performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison to the typical ten year contractual lives for
SOs. For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is to be recognized once each vesting
tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service. Stock-based compensation associated with
a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period
when such a determination is made. We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement to be
up to  five  years.  Stock-based  compensation  for  the  market-based  tranche  will  be  recognized  using  the  derived  service  period  for  the  market-based  metric
achievement, which we have initially estimated to be approximately three years.

In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of rSUs and other stock-based awards,
including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the
Directors’  Plan,  10  million  shares  of  common  stock  are  reserved  for  issuance (including  a  fiscal  2013  amendment  to  increase  the  number  of  shares  of  our
common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, and
expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. We currently grant rSUs only that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’
Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic
grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for
chairing  certain  Board  committees,  subject  to  certain  stockholder  approved  limitations  set  forth  in  the  Directors’  Plan.  In  April  2020,  the  Compensation
Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic rSU grants to each non-employee director from $400,000 to $350,000 and eliminated all equity
grants for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 81,000 unvested rSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of
common  stock (all of  which  were  vested)  were outstanding  under  the  Directors’  Plan.  As  of  May  31,  2020,  approximately 1  million shares  were available for
future stock awards under this plan.

In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’s
respective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the 2000 Plan. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed or
substituted generally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2020, stock
options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.

The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the gross difference between our closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2020 of $53.77 and the exercise prices for all “in-the-money”
options outstanding, excluding tax effects.

The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares expected to vest (unvested shares net of expected forfeitures) as of May 31, 2020 was approximately $64
million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.94 years. Approximately 49 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2020 were not expected to vest.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Stock Awards

We estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market values
as of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.

Stock-based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations:

Tax Benefits from Exercises of Stock Options and Vesting of Restricted Stock-Based Awards

Total cash received as a result of option exercises was approximately $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The
total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $2.9 billion, $3.1 billion
and $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that
were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $638 million, $692 million and $860 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fair
market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2020, 44 million shares were reserved for future issuances under the
Purchase Plan. We issued 2 million shares in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 3 million shares in fiscal 2018 under the Purchase Plan.

Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans

We offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $376 million, $380 million and
$384 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

In  the  U.S.,  regular  employees  can  participate  in  the  Oracle  Corporation  401(k)  Savings  and  Investment  Plan  (Oracle  401(k)  Plan).  Participants  can  generally
contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as
defined by the U.S. Internal revenue Service (IrS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period,
subject  to  maximum  aggregate  matching  amounts.  Our  contributions  to  the  Oracle  401(k)  Plan,  net  of  forfeitures,  were  $152  million,  $154  million  and  $151
million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

We  also  offer  non-qualified  deferred  compensation  plans  to  certain  employees  whereby  they  may  defer  a  portion  of  their  annual  base  and/or  variable
compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each
approximately $636 million and approximately $566 million as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and other
non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through
our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into
government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $97 million,
$90 million and $102 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of
our  defined  benefit  plans  as  of  May  31,  2020  were  $1.3  billion  and  $884  million,  respectively,  and  as  of  May  31,  2019  were  $1.2  billion  and  $821  million,
respectively.

INCOME TAXES

Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income
tax rates. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings in
foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the
Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). During fiscal 2019, we recorded a net benefit of
$389 million in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to adjustments in our estimates of the one-time transition tax on certain
foreign subsidiary earnings, and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities affected by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act).
Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to earnings in foreign operations,
state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived
Intangible Income deduction, GILTI, and the aforementioned $389 million net reduction to our transition tax recorded consistent with the provision of SAB 118.
Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Act upon
our adoption date of January 1, 2018 including the impacts of the transition tax, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax
authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction.

We provide for taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We do not provide for taxes on other outside basis temporary differences of foreign
subsidiaries as they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At May 31, 2020, the amount of temporary differences related to other outside basis
temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.9 billion. If the other
outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated
with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2020, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred
tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $1.5 billion.

Our net deferred tax assets were $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable
income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income
change.

The valuation allowance was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2020
and 2019 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and
the  recognition  of  the  associated  tax  benefits  associated  with  our  acquisitions  will  be  recorded  to  our  provision  for  income  taxes  subsequent  to  our  final
determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.

At  May  31,  2020,  we  had  federal  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of  approximately  $597  million,  which  are  subject  to  limitation  on  their  utilization.
Approximately $537 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $60 million of these
federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion at May 31,
2020, which expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1.9 billion at May 31, 2020, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net operating losses
are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $133 million, expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal
2040. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion at May 31, 2020, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $741
million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $357 million,
expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038.

We  classify  our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  as  either  current  or  non-current  income  taxes  payable  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The
aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows:

As  of May 31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,  $4.3  billion, $4.2  billion and  $4.2  billion, respectively, of unrecognized  tax benefits  would affect our effective tax rate if
recognized.  We  recognized  interest  and  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  line  of  our  consolidated  statements  of
operations of $202 million, $312 million and $127 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2020 and
2019 were $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal
2017.  Many  issues  are  at  an  advanced  stage  in  the  examination  process,  the  most  significant  of  which  include  the  deductibility  of  certain  royalty  payments,
transfer pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken. With all of
these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefits
related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $1.1 billion ($1.0 billion net
of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and we are no longer subject to audit for
those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with

some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.

Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it was
reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by as
much  as  $105  million  ($42  million  net  of  offsetting  tax  benefits)  in  the  next  12  months  related  primarily  to  transfer  pricing.  With  some  exceptions,  we  are
generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.

We  believe  that  we  have  adequately  provided  under  GAAP  for  outcomes  related  to  our  tax  audits.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurances  as  to  the  possible
outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof. On June 22, 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court declined a Writ of Certiorari in the case of Altera Corp vs
Commissioner challenging a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which itself reversed a previous decision of the U.S. Tax Court) holding that the U.S.
Treasury  Department’s  regulations  requiring  the  inclusion  of  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  a  taxpayer’s  cost-sharing  calculations  were  valid.  Our
consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  consistent  with  this  outcome,  and  accordingly  no  adjustments  will  be  required  as  the  result  of  this
development.

We are under audit by the IrS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in
various  challenges  and  litigation  in  a  number  of  countries,  including,  in  particular,  Australia,  Brazil,  Canada,  India,  Indonesia,  Israel,  South  Korea,  Mexico,
Pakistan,  Saudi  Arabia  and  Spain,  where  the  amounts  under  controversy  are  significant.  In  some,  although  not  all  cases,  we  have  reserved  for  potential
adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax
authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not
have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would
result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income
tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in
deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  and  in  assessing  performance.  Our  chief  operating  decision  makers  (CODMs)  are  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief
Technology  Officer.  We  are  organized  by  line  of  business  and  geographically.  While  our  CODMs  evaluate  results  in  a  number  of  different  ways,  the  line  of
business  management  structure  is  the  primary  basis  for  which  the  allocation  of  resources  and  financial  results  are  assessed.  The  tabular  information  below
presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocating
company resources.

We have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a  single operating segment. All three of our businesses
market  and  sell  our  offerings  globally  to  businesses  of  many  sizes,  government  agencies,  educational  institutions  and  resellers  with  a  worldwide  sales  force
positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.

Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise
deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and license
support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over
time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud services
and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available
and  for  which  the  customer  contracted  and  also  include  related  technical  support  services  over  the  contractual  term.  Cloud  license  and  on-premise  license
revenues  represent  fees  earned  from  granting  customers  licenses,  generally  on  a  perpetual  basis,  to  use  our  database  and  middleware  and  our  applications
software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the
customer  to  download  and  use,  which  typically  is  immediate  upon  signature  of  the  license  contract.  In  each  fiscal  year,  our  cloud  and  license  business’
contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal
quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts.

Our  hardware  business  provides  Oracle  Engineered  Systems,  servers,  storage,  industry-specific  hardware,  operating  systems,  virtualization,  management  and
other  hardware-related  software  to  support  diverse  IT  environments.  Our  hardware  business  also  offers  hardware  support,  which  provides  customers  with
software  updates  for  the  software  components  that  are  essential  to  the  functionality  of  their  hardware  products,  such  as  Oracle  Solaris  and  certain  other
software, and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.

Our  services  business  provides  services  to  customers  and  partners  to  help  maximize  the  performance  of  their  investments  in  Oracle  applications  and
infrastructure technologies.

We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.

Disaggregation of Revenues

We have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance, and disclosures presented outside of our financial
statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services as
presented in our consolidated statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as per the preceding tables of
this footnote.

The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region. The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region as
presented in the table below was materially consistent across each of our operating segments’ revenues for each of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018:

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted‑average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicable
pursuant to the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa
Clara  against  Oracle  Corporation  alleging  numerous  causes  of  action  including  breach  of  contract,  breach  of  the  covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing,
defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged
that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, it
breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 (the HP Settlement Agreement), resolving litigation between HP and one of Oracle’s former
CEOs who had previously acted as HP’s chief executive officer and chairman of HP’s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights and
obligations under the HP Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.

After a bench trial on the meaning of the HP Settlement Agreement, the court found that the HP Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop
certain of its software products for use on HP’s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP. The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury
returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its
cross-claims. The jury awarded HP $3.0 billion in damages. Under the court’s rulings, HP is entitled to post-judgment interest, but not pre-judgment interest, on
this award.

After the trial court denied Oracle’s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal of
the trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest.

Oracle has posted a mandated surety bond with the trial court for the amounts owing. No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations. We
continue  to  believe  that  we  have  meritorious  defenses  against  HP’s  claims,  and  we  intend  to  present  these  defenses  to  the  appellate  court.  Oracle  filed  its
opening brief on March 7, 2019. Briefing on the appeal was completed November 1, 2019, and the appellate court has not scheduled a date for oral argument.
We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the
nature  of  the  claims.  Litigation  is  inherently  unpredictable,  and  the  outcome  of  the  appeal  process  related  to  this  action  is  uncertain.  It  is  possible  that  the
resolution of this action could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations.

Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s NetSuite Acquisition

On  May  3  and  July  18,  2017,  two  alleged  stockholders  filed  separate  derivative  lawsuits  in  the  Court  of  Chancery  of  the  State  of  Delaware,  purportedly  on
Oracle’s  behalf.  Thereafter,  the  court  consolidated  the  two  derivative  cases  and  designated  the  July  18,  2017  complaint  as  the  operative  complaint.  The
consolidated lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.
Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. Plaintiff
seeks declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the
court denied on March 19, 2018.

On May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-
employee directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiff should be allowed to
proceed with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had fulfilled its duties and obligations, the Board withdrew the
SLC’s authority, except that the SLC maintained certain authority to respond to discovery requests in the litigation.

ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

After plaintiff filed its initial complaint, plaintiff filed several amended complaints. Plaintiff filed its most recent amended complaint on February 18, 2020. The
complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former Chief
Executive  Officer  who  passed  away  on  October  18,  2019),  and  two  other  members  of  our  Board  of  Directors.  Oracle  is  named  as  a  nominal  defendant.  The
complaint also asserts an aiding-and-abetting claim against NetSuite’s former Chief Executive Officer and NetSuite’s former Chief Technology Officer. The two
former NetSuite officers moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court held a hearing on that motion on March 11, 2020. The court has not yet ruled on that
motion. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer answered the latest complaint on March 3, 2020, and Oracle filed an answer on the same day.
On February 20, 2020, the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss. No hearing has been scheduled for this motion.

On April 20, 2020, after our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer indicated that they might challenge plaintiff’s standing to pursue this matter, an
additional plaintiff moved to intervene in this case. On April 29, 2020, the court granted that plaintiff’s motion to intervene. On May 7, 2020, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Technology Officer filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to have the plaintiff that filed the July 18, 2017 complaint dismissed from the
case for lack of standing, arguing that this plaintiff had not continuously owned Oracle stock during the relevant time period. This motion is scheduled for oral
argument on July 9, 2020.

While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Securities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s Cloud Business

On August 10, 2018, a putative class action, brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
against us, our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, two other Oracle executives, and one former Oracle executive. As noted above,
Mr.  Hurd,  one  of  our  then-two  Chief  Executive  Officers,  passed  away  on  October  18,  2019.  On  March  8,  2019,  plaintiff  filed  an  amended  complaint.  Plaintiff
alleges  that  the  defendants  made  or  are  responsible  for  false  and  misleading  statements  regarding  Oracle’s  cloud  business.  Plaintiff  further  alleges  that  the
former Oracle executive engaged in insider trading. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees and
costs, and unspecified declaratory/injunctive relief. On April 19, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint. On December 17, 2019, the
court granted this motion, giving plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint, which plaintiff filed on February 17, 2020. On April 23, 2020, defendants
filed a motion to dismiss, which is scheduled for hearing on September 24, 2020. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will
continue to vigorously defend it.

On February 12, 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought by
two alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiffs
claim that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and that Oracle’s Board members violated
their fiduciary duties  of care,  loyalty, reasonable inquiry,  and  good faith by failing to prevent  this alleged harm. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants’  actions
constitute gross mismanagement, waste, and securities fraud. Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants
are  liable for  breaching  their fiduciary  duties,  an order  directing  defendants  to  enact  corporate reforms,  attorneys’  fees and  costs,  and  unspecified  equitable
relief. On April 26, 2019, the court approved a stay of this action, which will be lifted if the class action discussed above is dismissed, if the motion to dismiss the
class action is denied, or if either party voluntarily chooses to lift the stay.

On May 8, 2019, a second derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged
stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, one former Oracle executive,
and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff claims that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class

115

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020

action  discussed  above  caused  harm  to  Oracle,  and  plaintiff  raises  further  allegations  of  impropriety  relating  to  Oracle’s  stock  buybacks  and  acquisition  of
NetSuite. Plaintiff asserts claims for violation of securities laws, violation of fiduciary duties, contribution and indemnification. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that the
case may proceed as a derivative action, and seeks damages, declaratory and other equitable relief, attorneys’ and expert fees and costs. On June 4, 2019, the
court issued an order finding that this case was related to the derivative case above and staying the case under the court’s prior stay order. On July 8, 2019,
plaintiffs in the two derivative actions filed a consolidated complaint. The actions remain stayed.

While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Other Litigation

We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings
and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters
cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are
materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.

Exhibit 31.01

I, Safra A. Catz, certify that:

1.

2.

3.

4.

I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Oracle Corporation;

Based on my knowledge,  this report does not contain any untrue statement  of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary  to make the
statements  made,  in  light  of  the  circumstances  under  which  such  statements  were  made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to  the  period  covered  by  this
report;

Based  on  my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial  information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in  all  material  respects  the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

I  am responsible for establishing  and  maintaining disclosure controls and  procedures  (as defined  in Exchange  Act  rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))  and
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

a)

b)

c)

d)

designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

designed  such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  or  caused  such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  to  be  designed  under  our
supervision,  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  registrant’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  presented  in  this  report  our  conclusions  about  the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent
fiscal  quarter  (the  registrant’s  fourth  fiscal  quarter  in  the  case  of  an  annual  report)  that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to
materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and

5.

I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the Finance and Audit
Committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

a)

b)

all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control
over financial reporting.
