ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

The Company

PART I

With a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in
the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Company
employs approximately 6,800 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to approximately 15 million people in 46 states. The
Company  conducts  the  majority  of  its  business  through  regulated  utilities  that  provide  water  and  wastewater  services,  collectively  presented  as  the  “Regulated
Businesses.” The Company also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary services. Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria of a
reportable  segment  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States  (“GAAP”), and  are  collectively  presented  as the  “Market-
Based Businesses,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

Throughout this Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean American
Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without
its subsidiaries.

Regulated Businesses

The  Company’s  primary  business  involves  the  ownership  of  utilities  that  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  to  residential,  commercial,  industrial,
public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers. The Company’s utilities operate in approximately 1,700 communities in 16 states in the United States,
with over 3.4 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple
state  utility  commissions  or  other  entities  engaged  in utility  regulation,  collectively  referred  to as public  utility  commissions  (“PUCs”).  Federal,  state  and local
governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in
the Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,094 million for 2019, $2,984 million for 2018 and $2,958 million for
2017, accounting for 86%, 87% and 88%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.

Presented in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses’ operating revenues and the number of customers the Company serves,

Customers

The Company’s Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or
any other entity that purchases the Company’s water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase the
Company’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses, such as homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.

Table of Contents

The vast majority of the Company’s regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage,
typically on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters
with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data
to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based
upon their water consumption.

Residential customers make up a substantial portion of the Company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i)
commercial  customers,  such as food and beverage  providers,  commercial  property developers  and proprietors,  and energy suppliers,  (ii) fire  service  customers,
where the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire
suppression systems  in office  buildings and other facilities,  (iii)  industrial  customers,  such as large-scale  manufacturers,  mining  and production  operations,  (iv)
public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community water
and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater, for their own customers.

The following chart depicts the allocation of the Company’s Regulated Businesses’ operating revenue of $3,094 million by type, including a breakout of the

Table of Contents

Customer growth in the Company’s Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water
and/or wastewater utility systems, (ii) population growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems.

Capital Investment

Excluding acquisitions, the Company plans to invest $8.2 billion over the next five years and between  $18 billion and $19 billion over the next 10 years,
including  $1.6  billion in  2020,  for  capital  improvements  to  its  Regulated  Businesses’  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure,  largely  for  pipe  replacement  and
upgrading  aging  water  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  The  Company  has  proactively  improved  its  pipe  renewal  rate  from  a  250-year  replacement  cycle  in
2009 to an expected 115-year replacement cycle by 2024, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,000 miles of mains and collection pipes
between 2020 and 2024. In addition, from 2020 to 2024, the Company’s capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities
is  expected  to  increase,  further  addressing  infrastructure  renewal,  resiliency,  water  quality,  operational  efficiency,  technology  and  innovation,  and  emerging
regulatory compliance needs. Additionally, the Company is investing significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability
by hardening  its assets.  Recently  completed  projects  include  the  $25 million  raised  floodwall  project  at New Jersey’s  Raritan  Millstone  Water  Treatment  Plant
which  provides  protection  against  a  500  year  flood,  and  the  $15  million  Bel  Air,  Maryland  Reservoir  project  which  provides  90  million  gallons  of  drought
mitigation water storage for the region.

Regulation and Rate Making

The operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary
responsibility of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ from
state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital,
operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions,
along with imposing  certain  penalties  or granting  certain  incentives.  Regulatory  policies  vary from state  to state  and could potentially  change  over time.  These
policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.

Periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is typically
determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment
costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” which is the time between
the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates.

Table of Contents

The  Company’s  Regulated  Businesses  support  regulatory  practices  at  the  PUCs  and  state  legislatures  that  mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of  regulatory  lag.

Presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices:

Regulatory Practices

Infrastructure replacement
surcharges

Future test year

Description

Allows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made to
replace  infrastructure  necessary  to  sustain  safe,  reliable  services  for  the  Company’s  customers.  These  mechanisms  typically
involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency.
A test period used for setting rates, which begins with the date new rates are effective. This allows current or projected revenues,
expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more timely basis.

mechanisms

Consolidated tariffs

Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance for
funds  used  during  construction.  In  addition,  some  states  allow  the  utility  to  seek  pre-approval  of  certain  capital  projects  and
associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.
Allows  changes  in  certain  operating  expenses,  which  may  fluctuate  based  on  conditions  beyond  the  utility’s  control,  to  be
recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding.
Separates  a  utility’s  cost  recovery  from  the  amount  of  water  it  sells  to  recover  its  fixed  costs  and  ongoing  infrastructure
investment needs. Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its
costs, regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing
an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently.
Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically
interconnected.  The  consolidated  tariff  pricing  structure  may  be  used  fully  or  partially  in  a  state,  and  is  generally  used  to
prioritize capital investments and moderate the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costs
for customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements.

The Company pursues enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments in order to continue to
provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the PUCs
will accept the Company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these regulatory practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associated
with traditional rate making processes. It is also the Company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply.

Acquisitions and Strategic Growth

The U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments
or governmental subdivisions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as of 2017, approximately 84% of the water market is served by
municipal  systems  and  approximately  98% of  the  country’s  wastewater  systems  are  government  owned.  The  EPA  also  estimates  that  there  are  approximately
50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States, with approximately 80% of the community water
systems serving a population of 3,000 or less.

A  fundamental  aspect  of  the  Company’s  growth  strategy  is  to  pursue  acquisitions  of  small  and  medium  water  and/or  wastewater  systems  in  geographic
proximity to areas where the Company operates its Regulated Businesses. The proximity of acquisition opportunities to the Company’s regulated footprint allows it
to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using its existing management, although the Company typically retains the majority, if not
all, of the employees, and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Company’s current customer mix of 93% water and 7%
wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation, allowing it to add wastewater customers where the Company
already serves water customers. The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in
its existing markets and, if appropriate, pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the Company does not currently operate its Regulated
Businesses. Before entering new regulated markets, the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to
achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to its customers, as
well as a line of sight to grow the Company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market.

Increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment,

financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.

Industry Legislation

In 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey,
including  municipal  and  investor-owned  utilities  with  more  than  500  service  connections.  This  law  imposes  requirements  in  areas  such  as  cybersecurity,  asset
management, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the most senior water manager,
or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems, to certify that
the system meets the requirements under the WQAA. In 2019, the New Jersey Senate held three hearings on the WQAA and is expected to introduce legislation in
the new 2020 legislative session that would strengthen accountability for obligations under the WQAA.

In 2018, similar legislation was passed in Indiana that set new operational requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants as part of the permitting
process for construction, installation, or modification of sources, facilities, equipment or devices. These requirements include capital asset management plans that
include annual reviews of infrastructure needs, engineering analysis of useful life, and a rate analysis to support the capital asset management plan. A life cycle
cost-benefit analysis must be done comparing owning and operating a plant to other alternatives to supply water or wastewater services. Cybersecurity plans must
also be developed. In 2019, additional legislation was passed which set requirements for access to loans or grants such as participation in regional planning events,
use of current capital asset management programs, and elimination of the causes of non-revenue water. The finance authority was also required to establish project
prioritization that included consideration of project effects on public health and safety, user rates and charges, plans for collaboration, plans to manage non-revenue
water and use of best practices.

Also, in 2018, America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 was signed into law. The legislation includes policies intended to improve water and wastewater
system management and authorization for states to assess consolidation options for systems that do not comply with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and its
rules  and  regulations.  The  legislation  increases  funding  to  water  system  funding  programs,  including  the  State  Revolving  Loan  Fund  program  and  the  Water
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (“WIFIA”).

The Company’s regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have access to fair market
value legislation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities, including
state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchased
property. Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, providing
municipalities with a purchase price that is reflective of the assets’ market value, while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over the
life of the assets, subject to state regulatory commission approval.

Consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected.
Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state.
As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest of
systems  and  prioritize  capital  needs  across  the  state.  Overall,  this  brings  cost-effective,  higher  quality  services  to  a  larger  number  of  citizens.  Twelve  of  the
Company’s  regulated  jurisdictions  currently  have  some  form  of  consolidated  tariff  pricing,  including  California,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Kentucky,  Maryland,
Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.

In  2018,  legislation  was  enacted  in  the  Company’s  Missouri  and  California  subsidiaries  changing  the  public  vote  requirement  for  the  sale  of  water  or
wastewater systems. In Missouri, the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than
500  small  towns.  Historically,  only  larger  communities  required  a  simple  majority,  while  smaller  communities  needed  a  two-thirds  majority.  This  legislation
increases the options for small towns, should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale. In California, the vote required to allow
cities to sell sewer systems changed to a simple majority from a two-thirds majority.

Competition

The Company’s Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those markets
pursuant to franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state PUCs or other
authorities, and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry. However,
the Company’s Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to
provide  their  own  water  supply/treatment  process  and  strategic  buyers  that  are  entering  new  markets  and/or  making  strategic  acquisitions.  When  pursuing
acquisitions, the Company’s largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, are Essential Utilities, Inc.
(formerly  known  as  Aqua  America,  Inc.),  Suez  North  America,  American  States  Water  Company  and  California  Water  Service  Group.  From  time  to  time,  the
Company also faces competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energy
and Corix.

Table of Contents

Condemnation and Eminent Domain

All or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the
following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when
the original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from
which  it  received  its  CPCN.  The  acquisition  consideration  related  to  such  a  proceeding  initiated  by  a  local  government  may  be  determined  consistent  with
applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.

As such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group in
Monterey,  California  successfully  added  “Measure  J”  to  the  November  2018  election  ballot  asking  voters  to  decide  whether  the  Monterey  Peninsula  Water
Management  District  (the  “MPWMD”)  should  conduct  a  feasibility  study  concerning  the  potential  purchase  of  the  Monterey  water  service  system  assets  (the
“Monterey system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote.
This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. In November 2018, Measure J was certified to have passed.

On August 19, 2019, the MPWMD’s General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board (1) develop criteria to determine which
water systems should be considered for acquisition, (2) examine the feasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller
systems only if the MPWMD becomes the owner of a larger system, (3) evaluate whether it is in the public interest to acquire the Monterey system assets and
sufficiently satisfy the criterion of “feasible” as provided in Measure J, (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an
acquisition, and (5) develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.

On November 6, 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey
system assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in
revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible.
The MPWMD will hold public hearings regarding the findings contained in this preliminary report. If the MPWMD were to make a final determination that an
acquisition  of  the  Monterey  system  assets  is  feasible,  then  the  MPWMD  would  commence  a  multi-year  eminent  domain  proceeding  against  the  Company’s
California subsidiary to first establish the MPWMD’s right to take the Monterey system assets and, if such right is established, to determine the amount of just
compensation to be paid to the California subsidiary for such assets.

Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit
against the Company’s Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. Before filing its eminent
domain lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. A jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline. The parties have
filed with the court updated valuation reports. Although the date of the valuation trial has not currently been scheduled, it is not likely to commence before the
second quarter of 2020.

Furthermore,  the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  the  Regulated  Businesses operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  property
owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage
to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connection
with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in
damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in other
cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility
would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.

Water Supply and Wastewater Services

The  Company’s  Regulated Businesses generally  own  the  physical  assets  used  to  store,  pump,  treat  and  deliver  water  to  its  customers  and  collect,  treat,
transport and recycle wastewater. Typically, the Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts,
permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The Company is
dependent  on  defined  sources  of  water  supply  and  obtains  its  water  supply  from  surface  water  sources  such  as  reservoirs,  lakes,  rivers  and  streams;  from
groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment the Company applies varies
significantly  depending  upon  the  quality  of  the  water  source  and  customer  stipulations.  Surface  water  sources  typically  generally  require  significant  treatment,
while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only.

The  Company’s  ability  to  meet  the  existing  and  future  water  demands  of  its  customers  depends  on  an  adequate  water  supply.  Drought,  governmental
restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and
surface water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term.
The geographic diversity of the Company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes it might
encounter in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce the
amount of source water available, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather.

Table of Contents

The  Company  evaluates  quality,  quantity,  growth  needs  and  alternate  sources  of  water  supply  as  well  as  transmission  and  distribution  capacity.  Water
supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that the Company has adequate water supply, it uses
long-term  planning  processes  and  maintains  contingency  plans  to  minimize  the  potential  impact  on  service  caused  by  climate  variability  and  a  wide  range  of
weather fluctuations. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs models to determine safe yields under
different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be
predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of the Company’s use of long-term planning to ensure that
it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply
Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to
the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project
(the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water
Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as
required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative
Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions.

Wastewater  services  involve  the  collection  of  wastewater  from  customers’  premises  through  sewer  lines.  The  wastewater  is  then  transported  through  a
sewer network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid
waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.

Seasonality

Customer  demand  for  the  Company’s  water  service  is  affected  by  weather  and  tends  to  vary  with  temperature  and  amount  and  frequency  of  rainfall.
Customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As
such,  the  Company  typically  expects  its  operating  revenues  to  be  the  highest  in  the  third  quarter  of  each  year.  Weather  that  is  hotter  and/or  drier  than  average
generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can
reduce  water  operating  revenues.  Three  of  the  Company’s  jurisdictions,  California,  Illinois  and  New  York,  have  adopted  revenue  stability  mechanisms  which
permit the Company to collect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening
the impact of weather variability. See “Regulation and Rate Making” for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.

Market-Based Businesses

The Company’s Market-Based Businesses provide complementary home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers and water and
wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, utilities and industrial customers. These businesses are not subject
to regulation by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for the Company’s Market-Based
Businesses were $539 million for 2019, $476 million for 2018 and $422 million for 2017, accounting for 15%, 14% and 13%, respectively, of the Company’s total
operating revenues for the same periods.

The Company’s primary Market-Based Businesses include the following operating segments:

•

•

Homeowner Services Group (“HOS”), which provides various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers;

Military  Services  Group (“MSG”),  which  enters  into  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  on
various military installations.

The Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services

through its Contract Services Group (“CSG”).

Previously,  the  Company  provided  customized  water  transfer  services  for  shale  natural  gas  exploration  and  production  companies  through  its  Keystone
Clearwater Solutions, LLC (“Keystone”) operations. On December 12, 2019, as part of a strategic review undertaken by the Company, the Company sold all of its
interest  in  Keystone  to  a  natural  gas  and  oil  industry  investment  group.  See  Note  4—Acquisitions  and  Divestitures in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements for additional information.

Table of Contents

Homeowner Services Group

The  Company’s  Homeowner  Services  Group,  which  includes  the  operations  of  Pivotal  Home  Solutions  (“Pivotal”)  acquired  in  June  2018,  provides
warranty  protection  programs  and  other  home  services  to  residential  customers  for  interior  and  exterior  water  and  sewer  lines,  interior  gas  and  electric  lines,
heating  and  cooling  systems,  water  heaters  and  other  home  appliances,  as  well  as  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  The  Company  develops
partnerships  with municipalities,  utilities  and other  organizations  to offer  protection  programs  to customers  serviced  by, or affiliated  with, those municipalities,
utilities and organizations. The term of these partnership agreements with the municipalities, utilities and other organizations is typically three to five years, with
mutual optional renewals. As of December 31, 2019, HOS had approximately 3 million customer contracts in 43 states.

Military Services Group

The  Company’s  Military  Services  Group operates  on  16 military  installations  under  50-year  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  as  part  of  its  Utility
Privatization  Program.  The  scope  of  these  contracts  generally  includes  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  installation’s  water  and  wastewater  systems  and  a
capital program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the
Company is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program
performed over the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the
installation’s mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital
program historically has not used the Company’s equity or debt borrowings; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under these
contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects. However, the U.S.
Army’s implementation of this requirement has limited the need for financing of these projects and the Company has been awarded several projects without any
requirement to provide financing.

The contract price for nine of the Company’s contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations,
and  every  three  years  thereafter.  Price  redetermination  is  a  contract  mechanism  to  periodically  adjust  the  service  fee  in  the  next  period,  to  reflect  changes  in
contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining seven contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a
mechanism similar to price redetermination called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All of these contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of
the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In either event,
pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts, the Company would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under
the  contract,  plus  the  contract  profit  margin  on  incurred  costs.  The  Company’s  backlog  of  revenue  associated  with  its  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  is
approximately $5.4 billion, with an average remaining contract term of 42 years.

Competition

The Company’s Market-Based Businesses face competition from a number of service providers, including HomeServe USA and Cinch Home Services in

HOS, and American States Water Company, Suez North America, and Veolia Environnement S.A. in MSG.

Environmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regulation

The  Company’s  water  and  wastewater  operations,  including  the  services  provided  by  both  its  Regulated Businesses and  Market-Based Businesses, are
subject  to  extensive  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  governing  the  protection  of  the  environment,  health  and  safety,  the  provision  of  water  and
wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges,
recycles and disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reduction
of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. Environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to
state  in  those  instances  where  a  state  has  adopted  a  standard  that  is  more  stringent  than  the  Federal  standard.  For  example,  while  the  EPA  has  issued  a  non-
enforceable Health Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS),
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is developing drinking water standards for these two compounds and has adopted a standard for a third
compound, perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, as well as other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The Company is also subject to various
federal, state, local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to
air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also set
conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the Company delivers.

12

Table of Contents

The Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and
effective use of natural resources, which is important given the overall trend that drinking water standards have become increasingly more stringent over time. As
newer  or  stricter  standards  are  introduced,  the  Company’s  capital  and  operating  costs  could  increase.  The  Company  incurs  substantial  costs  associated  with
compliance  with  the  environmental,  health  and  safety,  and  water  quality  standards  to  which  its  operations  are  subject  and  the  Company  invests  in  technology
solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring. The Company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately $600 million over the next five
years for environmental control facilities, which the Company defines for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water
or  land.  The  Company  believes  that  its  operations  are  materially  in  compliance  with,  and  in  many  cases  surpass,  minimum  standards  required  by  applicable
environmental laws and regulations.

The  Company’s  operations  also  involve  the  use,  storage  and  disposal  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  For  example,  the  Company’s  water  and
wastewater  treatment  facilities  store  and  use  chlorine  and  other  chemicals  that  generate  wastes  that  require  proper  handling  and  disposal  under  applicable
environmental requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its off-
site disposal of wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable
state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial
actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or
more hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such
sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup or
decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs. The Company’s
facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder. Certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings for additional information.

Safe Drinking Water Act

The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels
of numerous, naturally occurring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose new
rules.  These  rules  also  prescribe  testing  requirements  for  detecting  regulated  contaminants,  the  treatment  systems  that  may  be  used  for  removing  those
contaminants,  and  other  requirements.  To  date,  the  EPA  has  set  standards  for  approximately  90 contaminants  and  indicators  for  drinking  water,  and  there  is  a
process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.

To  help  formulate  the  basis  for  future  regulations,  the  EPA  has  the  authority  to  require  monitoring  for  additional,  unregulated  contaminants  under  the
Unregulated  Contaminant  Monitoring  Rule  (the  “Monitoring  Rule”).  The  Company’s  facilities  have  participated  in  the  data  gathering  effort  for  the  Monitoring
Rule in previous rounds, which occurs every five years, and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round, which is scheduled for completion by the end of
2020. There are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which are lacking a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects
information and/or treatment technology. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with
the  EPA  and  other  water  industry  groups  by  sharing  research  and  water  quality  operational  knowledge.  See  “Research  and  Development—Emerging
Containments” for additional information.

To effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking
water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and by-products of the disinfection process. In 2006, the EPA issued the Long-Term 2 Enhanced Surface
Water  Treatment  Rule  and  the  Stage  2  Disinfectants  and  Disinfection  Byproduct  Rule  and  finalized  the  Ground  Water  Rule,  which  is  applicable  to  systems
providing water from underground sources. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels
requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. The Company is within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with these standards, which includes sample
collection, data analysis, engineering planning and system implementation. Recent monitoring under the Long-Term 2 Rule has resulted in the need for more than
30 of the Company’s surface water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium. In many cases, this will involve installing UV disinfection,
and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades, an estimated $150 million to $250 million of investment will still be required for
the remaining facilities. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalent chromium, fluoride,
nitrosamines, perchlorate, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. The Company does not anticipate that any such regulations, if enacted,
will require implementation in 2020.

Table of Contents

The  Company  conducts  over  one  million  water  quality  tests  each  year  at  its  laboratory  facilities  and  plant  operations,  including  continuous  online
instrumentations  such  as  monitoring  turbidity  levels,  disinfectant  residuals  and  adjustments  to  chemical  treatment  based  on  changes  in  incoming  water.  The
Company participates in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 69
of the Company’s 80 surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that (i) have completed a
comprehensive  self-assessment  report,  (ii)  created  an  action  plan  for  continuous  improvement,  and  (iii)  produced  high-quality  drinking  water,  the  Company
accounts  for  approximately  one-third  of  the  plants  receiving  such  awards  nationwide.  In  addition,  67 of  the  Company’s  surface  water  treatment  plants  have
received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 62 plants have received the “Ten-Year Phase III” award,  58 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award,
and three plants have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III” award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20
years, respectively. Further, nine of the Company’s surface water plants have received the “Presidents” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the
Partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards.

Although  it  is  difficult  to  project  the  ultimate  costs  of  complying  with  the  above  or  other  pending  or  future  requirements,  the  Company  expects  current
requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not
expected  to have a material  impact  on its operations  or financial  condition.  In addition,  capital  expenditures  and operating  costs to comply with environmental
mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operating
and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements.

Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act

In 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions
in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water
Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in
reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The failure of certain
water systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to a
number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing water
main replacement and service line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace LSLs in accordance with current scientific guidance. Also, the Company
utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. The EPA proposed revisions to the
LCR in November 2019 designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water. The Company
continues to review the implications of the LCR and comments on the proposed revisions to the rule were due to the EPA by February 12, 2020. The Company will
develop an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements, if and when adopted, prior to the compliance effective dates in the final rule. Capital
expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisions cannot be determined until the final rule is promulgated, but costs
associated with compliance with federal regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.

The Company currently estimates that approximately 5% of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company or
customer portion of the service line (“LSLs”). The Company is replacing LSLs as part of ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects. The
Company’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most service areas by the end of
2030, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2 billion. The Company believes this will be attainable for most service areas where public policy is
supportive of this goal. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal
goals  appropriate  for  those  systems.  The  prioritization  of  LSL  removal  plan  is  dependent  on  several  factors,  including  the  Company’s  planned  water  main  and
service line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers with
respect  to  replacing  the  customer-owned  portion  of  the  LSL  as  necessary.  In  certain  cases  these  factors  may  result  in  a  shorter  or  longer  time  frame  for
replacement.  Because  replacing  the  external  LSL  in  its  entirety  is  advised  by  several  water  industry  organizations  including  the  U.S.  National  Drinking  Water
Advisory Council, the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Company’s preferred approach is to replace
the  entire  external  LSL  if  lead  is  found  on  either  the  Company  or  customer  portion  of  the  service  line.  The  Lead  Service  Line  Replacement  Collaborative  is  a
diverse  group of  public  health,  water  utility,  environmental,  labor,  consumer  and  housing organizations  from  across  the  country  working  together  to  encourage
communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level.

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition to
requirements  applicable  to  the  Company’s  wastewater  collection  systems,  its  operations  require  discharge  permits  under  the  National  Pollutant  Discharge
Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit
program, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges
that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant
fines and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may
impose time and cost burdens on the Company’s operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Company’s facilities, some of which result in
fines. The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance

The Company considers environmental, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”) to include: environmental leadership and sustainability; operational
excellence; employee engagement, safety and equality; active community engagement, civic and charitable involvement; and transparency and good governance.
Integration of these principles into the Company’s daily operations emphasizes its belief that “how” a company operates is just as important as “what” a company
does.

This focus is derived from the Company’s vision statement, “clean water for life,” and its core values: (i) safety; (ii) trust; (iii) environmental leadership;
(iv) teamwork; and (v) high performance, which are the principles by which it operates. The Company’s vision and values drive its company strategy, which is
centered on five central themes:

•

•

•

•

•

Safety—The safety of the Company’s employees and its customers is the number one focus for American Water.

Customers—The Company’s customers are at the center of everything it does, helping the Company to shape its strategic priorities. The Company
challenges  itself  so that  if  its regulated  utility  customers  were  to  have  a  choice  of  providers,  the  Company would want  them  to choose  American
Water.

People—Maintaining an environment which is open, transparent, diverse and inclusive, and where the Company’s people feel valued, included and
accountable, is critical to the Company’s ability to serve its customers every day.

Operational  Excellence—The  Company’s  operational  excellence  strategy  helps  it  to  find  better  and  more  efficient  ways  to  do  business,  and  to
provide safe, clean and affordable water services for its customers.

Growth—The Company believes that when companies grow, they can invest more in creating stable jobs, training, benefits, infrastructure and their
communities. The Company’s growth benefits all of its stakeholders, including its shareholders.

In 2019, the Company issued its fifth biennial Sustainability Report, covering its sustainability performance for calendar years 2018 and 2017. This report
can be accessed on the Company’s website, https://amwater.com, and was prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core Option, as well as standards from
the  Sustainability  Accounting  Standards  Board  and  Edison  Electric  Institute.  The  Company’s  first  report  was issued  in  2011, making  American  Water  the  first
large water services company to measure its performance against the Global Reporting Index. In addition, the Company’s sustainability practices have supported
its inclusion in the Euronext Vigeo® U.S. 50 index, FTSE4Good index series, 2018 NAACP Equity Inclusion and Empowerment Index, 2019 Constituent MSCI
ESG Leaders Indexes, 2020 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, and ranked 16th on the Corporate Knights’ 2020 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the

Research and Development

The Company’s Research and Development Program

The Company maintains an industry-leading Research and Development (“R&D”) program that is designed to enhance its services, help ensure compliance,
improve  quality  and  operational  effectiveness,  and  provide  environmental  leadership.  For  more  than  three  decades  from  its  inception,  American  Water’s  R&D
program  has  evolved  into  an  industry  leading  effort  and  has  achieved  numerous  advancements  in  the  science  of  drinking  water,  wastewater,  and  desalination.
Through laboratory and industry resources and the team’s expertise, efforts are focused on contaminants of emerging concern, including but not limited to PFAS,
Legionella,  cyanotoxin-forming  algal  blooms,  pathogens  and  disinfection  byproducts.  The  Company’s  R&D  personnel  are  located  at  the  Company’s  corporate
headquarters  and  at  two  laboratory  testing  facilities  in  New  Jersey  and  Illinois,  the  latter  housing  its  quality  control  and  testing  laboratory,  which  supports  the
Company’s R&D activities through testing and analysis.

The  Company  continues  to  leverage  its  expertise  and  collaborate  with  the  EPA  and  state  agencies  to  help  establish  effective  environmental,  health  and
safety, and water quality standards and regulation. This relationship includes the sharing of the Company’s research, such as its treatment and distribution system
optimization  research  and  its  national  water  quality  monitoring  data.  The  Company’s  engagement  with  the  EPA  provides  it  with  early  insight  into  emerging
regulatory  issues  and  initiatives,  thereby  allowing  the  Company  to  anticipate  and  to  accommodate  its  future  compliance  requirements.  The  Company  also
frequently  engages  with  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control,  other  state  environmental  agencies,  and  national  and  international  water  research  foundations.  The
Company believes that continued R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its leadership position in the
industry, which provides the Company with a competitive advantage as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers.

Emerging Contaminants

Emerging  contaminants  include  numerous  chemicals  such  as  pharmaceuticals,  personal  care  products,  pesticides,  herbicides  and  endocrine  disrupting
compounds, as well as some naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which
the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood and/or has not been quantified. While these contaminants have been present in drinking water for as long as
they have been in use, technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels,
has raised questions among regulators and government agencies, further affecting the public’s perception of drinking water quality.

The Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 159 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes that
can  affect  humans.  The  Company  is  continually  investigating  new  substances  and  contaminants,  employing  a  team  of  scientists,  engineers  and  public  health
professionals  to  identify  threats  to  its  water  supply,  to  act  on  emerging  regulations  and  new  health  advisories,  and  to  evaluate  the  benefits  of  alternative  or
advanced treatment technologies. The Company maintains state-of-the-art water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help
predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of the Company’s efforts include:

•

•

•

•

•

using its research findings to communicate information to its customers on the actions they can take to manage Legionella (the Centers for Disease
Control  statistics  indicate  that  water-associated  disease  from  Legionella  is  on  the  rise,  with  exposure  typically  associated  with  customer-owned
plumbing systems in large buildings);

aerial  drone  testing  to  detect  harmful  algal  blooms  and  testing  ultrasonic  technology  to  help  prevent  taste  and  odor  events  and  to  eliminate
cyanotoxins before they get to the water treatment plant;

the implementation of water source assessment tools, including sensors and analytics, to evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the detection
of source water contamination events;

development of methodology and measurement techniques for emerging contaminants to investigate transport, occurrence and treatment; and

the implementation of activated carbon, biofiltration and ion exchange for the control of emerging contaminants.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

We  operate  in  a  market  and  regulatory  environment  that  involves  significant  risks,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control.  In  addition  to  the  other
information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects.
Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows
and liquidity.

Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations

Our  utility  operations  are  subject  to  extensive  regulation  by  state  PUCs  and  other  regulatory  agencies,  which  significantly  affects  our  business,  financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our utility operations also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these
regulatory requirements.

Our Regulated Businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs. This
regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations. Generally, the state PUCs authorize us
to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operating and maintenance
costs, depreciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.

Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rate
increase applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, or
may be partially approved, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to:

•

•

•

cover our expenses, including purchased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;

enable us to recover our investment; and

provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.

Approval of the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial
penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits, approvals
and  certificates  from  the  PUCs  that  regulate  their  businesses  and  authorize  acquisitions,  dispositions,  and,  in  certain  cases,  affiliated  transactions.  Although  we
believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations, we are
unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business.

In any of these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if rates are sufficient,
we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certain conditions
exist, including, but not limited to, if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than
the level estimated in establishing rates.

Our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety laws
and regulations, including with respect to emerging contaminants, compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures, and
violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.

Our regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our Market-Based Businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and
regulations. These requirements include, among others, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the LCR and CERCLA. EPA requirements and similar
federal and state laws and regulations. For example, state PUCs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services
we deliver. If we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws,
regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as
damage to our reputation. In the most serious cases, regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating
assets to another utility or to a municipality. Given the nature of our business which, in part, involves supplying water for human consumption, any potential non-
compliance with, or violation of, environmental, water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a
company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry.

In  addition,  CERCLA  authorizes  the  EPA  to  issue  orders  and  bring  enforcement  actions  to  compel  responsible  parties  to  investigate  and  take  remedial
actions  with  respect  to  actual  or  threatened  releases  of  hazardous  substances,  and  can  impose  joint  and  several  liability,  without  regard  to  fault,  on  responsible
parties for the costs thereof. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.

We  incur  substantial  operating  and  capital  costs  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  comply  with  environmental,  water  quality  and  health  and  safety  laws  and
regulations. These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, generally have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase
our  costs.  Although  we  may  seek  to  recover  ongoing  compliance  costs  in  our  Regulated  Businesses  through  customer  rates,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  the
various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or
that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

We  may  also  incur  liabilities  if,  under  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  we  are  required  to  investigate  and  clean  up  environmental  contamination,
including  potential  releases  of  hazardous  chemicals,  such  as  chlorine,  which  we  use  to  treat  water,  or  at  off-site  locations  where  we have  disposed  of  waste  or
caused an adverse environmental impact. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in
significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may not be covered by
insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.

Attention is being given to emerging contaminants, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory
standard  in  drinking  water  or  have  been  recently  created  or  discovered  (including  by  means  of  scientific  achievements  in  the  analysis  and  detection  of  trace
amounts  of  substances).  Examples  of  sources  of  emerging  contaminants  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  newly  created  chemical  compounds  (including,  for
example, manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds; bacteria, microbes, viruses, amoebae and
other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from
these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in
whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapid
pace at which emerging contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking water
system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. In addition, we believe emerging
contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could significantly increase
the cost of our operations.

Limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our
access to sources of water, our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services.

Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources of
public water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers, are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests. As a result, we
typically  do  not  own  the  water  that  we  use  in  our  operations,  and  the  availability  of  our  water  supply  is  established  through  allocation  rights  (determined  by
legislation or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements  set by governmental entities. Passing-flow requirements  set minimum volumes of water that must
pass through specified water sources, such as rivers and streams, in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users.
Allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing-flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller
rivers, lakes and streams. These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water supply. Supply
issues, such as drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of
ground and surface water.

For example, in our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an October
20, 2009 cease and desist order (the “2009 Order”), as amended by an order in July 2016 (the “2016 Order”), of the SWRCB that requires California-American
Water Company, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Cal Am”), to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedule
that terminates on December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Deadline”). We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with the
requirements of the Endangered Species Act. We cannot predict whether Cal Am will be able to secure alternative sources of water, or if Cal Am will be exposed
to liabilities, including fines and penalties, if it is unable to meet the 2021 Deadline under the 2016 Order. Furthermore, Cal Am continues to work constructively
with  all  appropriate  agencies  to  provide  necessary  information  to  obtain  the  required  approvals  for  the  Water  Supply Project;  however,  due  to  the  delay  in  the
approval  schedule,  Cal  Am  currently  does  not  believe  that  it  will  be  able  to  fully  comply  with  the  diversion  reduction  requirements  and  other  remaining
requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, including the 2021 Deadline. If Cal Am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative
source of water, or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could  be  adversely  affected.  See  Item  3—Legal  Proceedings—Alternative  Water  Supply  in  Lieu  of  Carmel  River  Diversions,  which  includes  additional
information regarding this matter.

Climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of which
may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise.

The issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. Some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather
volatility in the future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewater
utilities, including us, such as:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

increased frequency and duration of droughts;

increased precipitation and flooding;

increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events;

challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;

potential degradation of water quality;

decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns;

increases in disruptions in service;

increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or

increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our
water production and delivery facilities and systems.

Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our Regulated Businesses could be recovered
through rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to
enable us to recover such expenditures and costs, in whole or in part.

22

The current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as “regulatory lag,” from the time that we invest in infrastructure
improvements, incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case
applications; our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.

There is typically a delay, known as “regulatory lag,” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating
expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based on
the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining
usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

We  endeavor  to  reduce  regulatory  lag  by  pursuing  constructive  regulatory  policies.  For  example,  three  of  our  states  have  approved  revenue  stability
mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition of
declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 11 of our state PUCs
permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement of
aging  infrastructure.  These  surcharges  are  adjusted  periodically  based  on  factors  such  as  project  completion  or  future  budgeted  expenditures,  and  specific
surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, ten of our state PUCs allow
us to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflected
in rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control,
such as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation, chemical or other expenditures. These surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust
rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the general rate case application process.

While these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in
those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue
in  their  current  form,  or  at  all.  Although  we  intend  to  continue  our  efforts  to  expand  state  PUC approval  of  surcharges  to  address  issues  of  regulatory  lag,  our
efforts may not be successful, or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag, in which case our business, financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.

Changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and liquidity.

New legislation,  regulations, government policies or court decisions, including, without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax
laws,  can  materially  affect  our  operations,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  The  individuals  who  serve  as  regulators  are  elected  or  political  appointees.
Therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators
and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy,
including those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences,
among others:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

making it more difficult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;

changing the determination of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases;

restricting  our  ability  to  terminate  our  services  to  customers  who  owe  us  money  for  services  previously  provided  or  limiting  our  bill  collection
efforts;

requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;

limiting  or restricting  our  ability  to acquire  water  or  wastewater  systems,  purchase  or  dispose  of  assets  or  issue securities,  or  making  it less  cost-
effective for us to do so;

negatively impacting the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, the amount of tax credits or tax abatement benefits that may be
available, the amount of taxes owed, the timing of tax effects on rates, or the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;

changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;

increasing  the  associated  costs  of,  or  difficulty  complying  with,  environmental,  health,  safety,  consumer  privacy,  water  quality,  and  water  quality
accountability laws and regulations to which our operations are subject;

23

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;

making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or
for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;

placing limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a
regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;

restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and

revoking or altering the terms of a CPCN issued to us by a state PUC.

Any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

In addition, new Federal, state and local laws, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof, could impact us. In
December 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain other
provisions  related  specifically  to  the  public  utility  industry,  including  the  normalization  of  our  deferred  income  taxes.  The  enactment  of  the  TCJA required  re-
measurement of our deferred income taxes, which materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position and had a lesser impact on our 2018
results of operations and financial position. Following enactment of the TCJA, the Company adjusted its customer rates and deferred income taxes to reflect the
lower  income  tax  rate  as  mandated  by  PUCs  in  jurisdictions  that  have  addressed  the  issue.  We  expect  that  further  impacts  to  our  deferred  income  taxes  will
continue to occur through pending or future rate cases or other proceedings in the remaining jurisdictions. At this time, we cannot predict the impacts on us of the
regulatory treatment of the TCJA in these remaining proceedings, or of the enactment or adoption of any Related Interpretations, if and when issued. Moreover, we
are  unable  to  determine  or  predict  the  potential  impacts,  if  any,  of  any  other  new  or  amended  laws,  rules  or  regulations,  or  interpretations  thereof,  including,
without limitation, further amendments to the Code or applicable Treasury regulations, to the extent they may be ultimately enacted, adopted or issued, on us or our
businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for
our water services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Service  interruptions  due  to  severe  weather,  climate  variability  patterns  and  other  natural  events  are  possible  across  all  our  businesses.  These  include,
among other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and intercoastal
floods or high water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, severe electrical storms, sinkholes and solar flares. Weather and other natural
events  such  as  these  may  affect  the  condition  or  operability  of  our  facilities,  limiting  or  preventing  us  from  delivering  water  or  wastewater  services  to  our
customers,  or  requiring  us  to  make  substantial  capital  expenditures  to  repair  any  damage.  Tariffs  in  place  or  cost  recovery  proceedings  with  respect  to  our
Regulated Businesses may not provide reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.

Government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers,
which  may  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Seasonal  drought  conditions  that  may  impact  our  water  services  are
possible across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the
supply  adequacy  of  any  individual  system.  Responses  may  range  from  voluntary  to  mandatory  water  use  restrictions,  rationing  restrictions,  water  conservation
regulations, and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be
recoverable  provided  the  relevant  PUC  determines  they  were  reasonable  and  prudent,  we  cannot  assure  that  any  such  expenses  incurred  will,  in  fact,  be  fully
recovered. Moreover, reductions in water consumption, including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even
after  drought restrictions  are  repealed  and the  drought has ended, which could adversely  affect  our business, financial  condition,  results  of operations  and cash
flows.

A  loss  of  one  or  more  large  industrial  customers  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  upon  the  results  of  operations  of  one  or  more  of  our  Regulated
Businesses.

Adverse economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers, particularly industrial customers, to curtail operations. A curtailment of operations
by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent.
Any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. Tariffs in place with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.

Our Regulated Businesses require  significant  capital  expenditures  and  may  suffer  if  we  fail  to  secure  appropriate  funding  to  make  investments,  or  if  we
experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects.

The  water  and  wastewater  utility  business  is  capital  intensive.  We  invest  significant  amounts  of  capital  to  add,  replace  and  maintain  property,  plant  and
equipment, and to improve aging infrastructure. In 2019, we invested $1.7 billion in net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expenditures
necessary  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  our  systems  will  continue  into  the  future  and  may  increase.  We  expect  to  fund  capital  improvement  projects  using  cash
generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt and equity. We may not
be  able  to  access  our  revolving  credit  facility  or  the  commercial  paper,  long-term  debt  and  equity  capital  markets,  when  necessary  or  desirable  to  fund  capital
improvements  on  favorable  terms  or  at  all.  If  we  are  not  able  to  obtain  sufficient  financing,  we  may  be  unable  to  maintain  our  existing  property,  plant  and
equipment,  fund  our  capital  investment  strategies,  meet  our  growth  targets  and  expand  our  rate  base  to  enable  us  to  earn  satisfactory  future  returns  on  our
investments. Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital
projects on time, as a result of construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, or other obstacles. Each of
these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Aging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions, property damage and increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, all of which could negatively impact
our financial results.

We  have  risks  associated  with  aging  infrastructure,  including  water  and  sewer  mains,  pumping  stations  and  water  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.
Additionally, the nature of information available on buried and newly acquired assets may be limited, which may challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset
management  and  maintenance  practices.  Assets  that  have  aged  beyond  their  expected  useful  lives  may  experience  a  higher  rate  of  failure.  Failure  of  aging
infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, and negatively impact our future O&M efficiency ratio. In addition, failure of aging
infrastructure may result in property damage, and in safety, environmental and public health impacts. To the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not
fully recovered in rates, our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.

Seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues.

The volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increased
water usage for irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months,
the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months
are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.

Three of our jurisdictions, California, Illinois, and New York, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to collect state PUC-authorized
revenue for a given period, which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recover
the fixed cost of operations while supporting water conservation goals. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, operating results
could continue to be affected by seasonality.

Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs.

The  wastewater  collection,  treatment  and  disposal  operations  of  our  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  substantial  regulation  and  involve  environmental  risks.  If
collection, treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties
or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is most acute during periods of
substantial  rainfall  or  flooding,  which  are  the  main  causes  of  sewer  overflow  and  system  failure.  Liabilities  resulting  from  such  damage  could  adversely  and
materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Contamination  of  water  supplies  or  our  water  service  provided  to  our  customers  could  result  in  service  limitations  and  interruptions  and  exposure  to
substances not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations,
government enforcement actions, damage to our reputation and private litigation.

The  water  supplies  that  flow  into  our  treatment  plants  or  are  delivered  through  our  distribution  system,  or  the  water  service  that  is  provided  to  our
customers, may be subject to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems,
pollution resulting from man-made sources (such as perchlorate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, lead and other materials, chemical spills or other accidents that result
in contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks. In addition, new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water industry.
If one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to take
responsive  actions  that  could  include,  among  other  things  (1)  continuing  limited  use  of  the  water  supply  under  a  “Do  Not  Use”  protective  order  that  enables
continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply. If service is disrupted, our financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source
through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods. We may be unable to recover
costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms. Any recovery of these costs that we
are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arising
from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our
drinking water and water supplies.

Since  we  engage  in  the  business  of  providing  water  service  to  our  customers,  contamination  of  the  water  supply,  or  the  water  service  provided  to  our
customers, could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Such
claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may be
brought by our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur, and
we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to our reputation
may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or
hazardous substances in the water or water supplies. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductibles
and other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

We may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.

We  maintain  insurance  coverage  as  part  of  our  overall  legal  and  risk  management  strategy  to  minimize  potential  liabilities  arising  from  our  utility
operations,  as  well  as  the  operations  of  our  Market-Based Businesses.  Our  insurance  programs  have  varying  coverage  limits,  exclusions  and  maximums,  and
insurance  companies  may  seek  to  deny  claims  we  might  make.  Generally,  our  insurance  policies  cover  property  damage,  worker’s  compensation,  employer’s
liability, general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for
covered claims. As a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.

Although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance  coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure all
necessary  or  appropriate  insurance  in  the  future,  or  that  such  insurance  can  be  economically  secured.  For  example,  catastrophic  events  can  result  in  decreased
coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles.

We are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory
oversight or sanctions.

Our  business  and  operations  have  a  large  direct  and  indirect  customer  base  and,  as  a  result,  we  are  exposed  to  public  criticism  regarding,  among  other
things, the reliability of their water, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of water provided, and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and format of
bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies, state PUCs and
other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative,
regulatory  and  economic  outcomes,  as  well  as  increased  regulatory  or  other  oversight  and  more  stringent  regulatory  or  economic  requirements.  Unfavorable
regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms
in our agreements related to our Market-Based Businesses, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing
could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

For example, New York American Water Company, Inc. (“NYAW”) has been the subject of a New York State Public Service Commission (“NYSPSC”)
investigation related to the unintentional provision of incorrect data to a taxing authority that resulted in an over-assessment of real property taxes. NYAW self-
reported this issue to the NYSPSC promptly after NYAW’s senior leadership became aware of it. Neither NYAW nor any of its employees received any financial
benefit as a result of this matter, as all customer overpayments were provided to the local taxing authorities. The NYSPSC investigation also related to the failure
of a few employees working on NYAW’s 2016 general rate case to properly disclose these issues in that rate case. In September 2018, a settlement of these matters
was approved by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Albany County, and NYAW has been working with the New York State Department of Public
Service to implement its terms. While the settlement resolves the NYSPSC’s investigation involving NYAW and those matters set forth above, there can be no
assurance that NYAW will not be subject to additional federal, state or local proceedings regarding these and other related matters, and these proceedings could
result in increased oversight and civil, administrative and/or criminal sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect upon our reputation and perception.

The failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows and liquidity.

The properties of our Regulated Businesses segment include 76 dams, the majority of which are earthen dams, and the failure of any of which could result
in personal injury and property damage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also
adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may
make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.

We also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been
material. The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entail
material costs. Although in most cases, the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able to
recover  costs of repairs,  upgrades or dismantling  through rates  in the future.  The inability  to recover  these costs or delayed recovery  of the costs as a result of
regulatory lag can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and
reputation.

Our  operating  subsidiaries  distribute  water  and  collect  wastewater  through  an  extensive  network  of  pipes  and  storage  systems  located  across  the  United
States.  A  failure  of  major  pipes  or  reservoirs  could  result  in  injuries,  property  and  other  damage  for  which  we  may  be  liable.  The  failure  of  major  pipes  and
reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our
ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators,
including state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation.
Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to
secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not be
recovered through rate adjustments.

An  important  part  of  our  growth  strategy  is  the  acquisition  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  involves  risks,  including  competition  for  acquisition
opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyers, that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.

An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and move
into  new,  service  areas.  We  may  not  be  able  to  acquire  other  systems  or  businesses  if  we  cannot  identify  suitable  acquisition  opportunities  or  reach  mutually
agreeable  terms  with  acquisition  candidates.  Further,  competition  for  acquisition  opportunities  from  other  regulated  utilities,  governmental  entities,  and  other
buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business.

The  negotiation  and  execution  of  potential  acquisitions  as  well  as  the  integration  of  acquired  systems  or  businesses  with  our  existing  operations  could

require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:

•

•

•

•

incurrence or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities of or with respect to an acquired business, including liabilities
that were unknown at the time of acquisition;

failure to recover acquisition premiums;

unanticipated capital expenditures;

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;

27

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

•

the need to successfully integrate the acquired systems’ cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures with those of the Company’s;

recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;

fluctuations in quarterly results;

unanticipated acquisition-related expenses;

failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and

difficulties in integrating or assimilating personnel, benefits, services and systems.

Some  or  all  of  these  items  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business.  The  systems  and  businesses  we  acquire  in  the  future  may  not  achieve
anticipated  sales  and profitability  or other  perceived  synergies,  and any difficulties  we encounter  in the integration  process  could  interfere  with our operations,
reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.

We compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. If consolidation becomes
more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and
limit our ability to expand through acquisitions.

Our Regulated Businesses are  subject  to  condemnation  and  other  proceedings  through  eminent  domain  or  other  similar  authorized  process,  which  could
materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition.

Municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States,
and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public
ownership  and  operation  through  exercise  of  the  governmental  power  of  eminent  domain,  or  another  similar  authorized  process.  A  municipality  or  other
government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of a
citizen petition.

For example, in November 2018, Monterey, California ballot Measure J was certified as having been approved by a public vote, requiring the MPWMD
to conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the Monterey system assets without an additional public vote. On
November  6, 2019, the  MPWMD issued  a  preliminary  report  finding,  among  other  things,  that  the  acquisition  of  the  Monterey  system  assets  by the  MPWMD
would be economically  feasible. Also, five municipalities  in the Chicago, Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our
Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. This lawsuit remains pending, and a valuation trial is
likely to be held in the near future. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Condemnation and Eminent Domain, which includes additional information
regarding these matters.

Furthermore,  the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  Regulated Businesses operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  property
owners  to  file  a lawsuit  to  seek  just  compensation  against  a  public  utility,  if  the  public  utility’s  infrastructure  has  been  determined  to  be a  substantial  cause  of
damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in
connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that
resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits.

Contesting an exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedings
and may divert the attention of management. Moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which may
require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding  or to pay a private  property owner compensation  for the property damage suffered.  If a
municipality  or  other  government  subdivision  succeeds  in  acquiring  the  assets  of  one  or  more  of  our  Regulated Businesses through  eminent  domain  or  other
process, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not be
able to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.

We rely on operational and technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these
systems could adversely affect our business.

Our  operational  and  technology  systems  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business,  and  any  disruption  of  these  systems  could  significantly  limit  our  ability  to
manage  and  operate  our  business  efficiently,  which,  in  turn,  could  cause  our  business  and  competitive  position  to  suffer  and  adversely  affect  our  results  of
operations. For example, we depend on these systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage certain plant operations and construction
projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory and
accounts receivable collections.

28

Table of Contents

Although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure than other similar organizations, our technology systems remain

vulnerable to damage or interruption from:

•

•

•

•

•

power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;

operator error or improper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees and contractors;

physical and electronic loss of customer or employee data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, hacking, denial of services action, misappropriation
of data or other property and similar events;

computer viruses; and

severe weather and other events, including without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other disasters.

These events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer, employee or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation of property and other
adverse consequences. In addition, a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact
of any of these events on us. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and
we  might  lack  sufficient  resources  to  make  the  necessary  upgrades  or  replacements  of  outdated  existing  technology  to  enable  us  to  continue  to  operate  at  our
current  level  of efficiency.  Any or all  of these  events  could  have a material  adverse  impact  on our business, results  of operations,  financial  condition  and cash
flows.

We may be subject to physical and/or cyber attacks.

As  operators  of  critical  infrastructure,  we  may  face  a  heightened  risk  of  physical  and/or  cyber  attacks  from  internal  or  external  sources.  Our  water  and
wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Our
operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or
terrorism,  and  other  causes.  Unauthorized  access  to  confidential  information  located  or  stored  on  these  systems  could  negatively  and  materially  impact  our
customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or
administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protect
our operational and technology systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. We
cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.

If, despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customer
and other confidential information lost or stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; suffer a loss of management time,
attention and resources from our regular business operations; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, and damage to our reputation, any of which could
have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be non-compliant with
applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings
and regulatory fines or penalties. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and
insurance related costs.

In  addition,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  collect  and  retain  sensitive  information,  including  personally  identifiable  information,  about  our
customers and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss and/or
fraudulent  use  of  customer,  employee  or  proprietary  data  as  a  result  of  a  cyber  attack  could  subject  us  to  significant  litigation,  liability  and  costs,  as  well  as
adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.

We have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach, but such insurance is
subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. The market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and
coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are
reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.

Our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected costs
or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.

Upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management’s
time  and  financial  resources  to  complete,  and  may  also  result  in  system  or  network  defects  or  operational  errors  due  to  multiple  factors,  including  employees’
ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and have
installed new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. These efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations and
enhance our customer service capabilities. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may
increase  costs  beyond  those  anticipated  and  have  an  adverse  or  disruptive  effect  on  our  operations  and  reporting  processes,  including  our  internal  control  over
financial  reporting.  We  may  also  experience  difficulties  integrating  current  systems  with  new  or  upgraded  systems,  which  may  impact  our  ability  to  serve  our
customers effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that all
such impacts have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

An inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

A significant part of our long-term strategic focus on safety, operational excellence, O&M expense efficiency, water quality, asset and capital management
and the customer experience includes the development and implementation of new technologies to be used for, among other things: customer service and support;
environmental  compliance;  water  metering;  water  quality  and  source  monitoring;  cybersecurity;  business  development  and  growth;  data  analysis;  employee
development and training; and other initiatives. For example, we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing, deploying and
maintaining customer-facing technologies, applications to support field service and customer service operations, water source sensor and evaluation technologies,
and data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies. Where appropriate, we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructure
and systems.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing, developing, deploying, integrating or maintaining these new technologies, and if they do
not perform effectively or adequately serve their respective business objectives, their value to us and our business and operations may be negatively and materially
impacted.  Because  these  efforts  can  be  long-term  in  nature,  these  new  technologies  may  be  more  costly  or  time-consuming  than  expected  to  design,  develop,
integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion. Technologies that do not perform as intended or desired
may need to be redesigned, redeveloped or abandoned. While we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with
respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our Regulated Businesses, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to do so in every instance or at all. Our failure to timely and effectively invest in, develop, deploy and implement improvements to, and properly maintain the
operation  and  integrity  of,  our  new  technologies,  including  related  data  and  other  related  systems,  and/or  adequately  obtain  recovery  in  rates  of  the  costs  and
expenses  associated  with  such  activities,  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  achieve  intended  O&M expense  efficiencies  or  other  key  performance  results  and,
ultimately, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

All of the intellectual property that has been or is being used or developed in connection with these technologies, we believe we own, or have valid licenses
to use. However, competitors, contracting parties or other third parties may bring claims against us to challenge our right to use, license, sub-license, market or
monetize, in whole or in part, such intellectual property or derivatives thereof or works made therefrom, and the assertion, defense or protection of our intellectual
property rights could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful. If we are unable to do so, or it is determined that we do not own or have valid
licenses or other rights to any of the intellectual property used in our technologies, we may lose valuable rights to what we regard as our intellectual property, the
carrying values of the affected technologies may need to be decreased significantly, and we may be required to obtain or purchase licenses at significant cost from
third  parties  to  use  the  intellectual  property.  In  any  of  these  cases,  we  may  be  unable  to  execute  our  long-term  strategy,  and  our  financial  condition,  results  of
operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted.

Our business has inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life, and be exposed
to financial losses, including penalties and other liabilities.

Safety  is  a  core  value  and  a  strategy  at  American  Water.  Our  safety  performance  and  continual  progress  to  our  ultimate  desired  goal  of  zero  injuries  is
critical to our reputation. We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and the public. Although we intend to
adhere to such health and safety standards with a goal of achieving zero injuries, it is extremely challenging to eliminate all safety incidents at all times.

30

Table of Contents

At our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, our employees, contractors and others are often in close proximity to large pieces of
equipment, moving vehicles, pressurized water, underground trenches and vaults, chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites, we are responsible for
safety  and,  accordingly,  must  implement  important  safety  procedures  and  practices  above  what  governmental  regulations  require.  If  we  fail  to  implement  such
procedures  or  if  the  procedures  we  implement  are  ineffective  or  are  not  followed  by  our  employees  or  others,  our  employees,  contractors  and  others  may
experience minor, serious or fatal injuries. Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover, expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs.
Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

In  addition,  our  operations  can  involve  the  delivery,  handling  and  storage  of  hazardous  chemicals,  which,  if  improperly  delivered,  handled,  stored  or
disposed  of,  could  result  in  serious  injury,  death,  environmental  damage  or  property  damage,  and  could  subject  us  to  penalties  or  other  liabilities.  We  are  also
subject  to  regulations  dealing  with  occupational  health  and  safety.  Although  we  maintain  functional  employee  groups  whose  primary  purpose  is  to  ensure  we
implement effective health and, safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to
comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability.

Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 46% of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 71 collective bargaining agreements in place with
14 different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, including four which are beyond expiration and 14 which will
expire during 2020, are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that
are fair to us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or
work stoppages. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations, may
disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. While
we  have  developed  contingency  plans  to  be  implemented  as  necessary  if  a  work  stoppage  or  strike  does  occur,  a  strike  or  work  stoppage  may  have  a  material
adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel.

The  success  of  our  business  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  hire,  retain,  and  utilize  qualified  personnel,  including  engineers,  licensed  operators,  water
quality  and  other  operating  and  craft  personnel,  and  management  professionals  who  have  the  required  experience  and  expertise.  From  time  to  time,  it  may  be
difficult  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  individuals  with  the  expertise  and  in  the  timeframe  demanded  for  our  business  needs.  In  certain  geographic  areas,  for
example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.

In addition, as key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. If
we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted.

Financial and Market-Related Risks

Our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate
sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs.

As of December 31, 2019, our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was
$9.5  billion,  and  our  working  capital  (defined  as  current  assets  less  current  liabilities)  was  in  a  deficit  position.  Our  indebtedness  could  have  important
consequences, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;

exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;

limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;

impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;

requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, thereby
reducing funds available for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;

limiting  our ability  to  take  advantage  of significant  business opportunities,  such  as acquisition  opportunities,  and to react  to  changes  in market  or
industry conditions; and

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.

31

Table of Contents

In order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue a combination
of  new  short-term  and  long-term  debt  securities  and  equity.  Moreover,  additional  borrowings  may  be  required  to  refinance  outstanding  indebtedness.  Debt
maturities and sinking fund payments in 2020, 2021 and 2022 will be  $28 million, $310 million and $14 million, respectively. We can provide no assurance that
we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks
we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms.

In an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt, we have in the past entered into, and
in the future may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury
lock agreements. See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. However, these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest
rate  risk,  and  may  expose  us  to  other  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  quarterly  “mark  to  market”  valuation  risk  associated  with  these  instruments,  that  could
negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance, which will be affected by the
financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other risk
factors described in this section, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding
debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In
addition,  if  our  business  does  not  generate  sufficient  cash  flows  from  operations,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  incur  indebtedness  sufficient  to  enable  us  to  fund  our
liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to
be affected materially and adversely.

Our inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to
meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to cash from operations, we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility, commercial  paper program, and the capital markets to satisfy our
liquidity needs. In this regard, our principal external sources of short-term liquidity are our $2.10 billion commercial paper program and our $2.25 billion revolving
credit facility. Our revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in March 2024, although under those terms we may request to extend the
expiration  date  for  up  to  one  year.  We  regularly  use  our  commercial  paper  program  under  this  revolving  credit  facility  as  a  principal  source  of  short-term
borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2019, American Water Capital
Corp. (“AWCC”), our wholly owned financing subsidiary, had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and had $786 million of commercial
paper outstanding and $76 million in outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that AWCC will be able to continue to access its commercial paper
program or its revolving credit facility, when, as and if desired, or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity
needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.

Under the terms of our revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the terms
of the credit facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit, lenders under the credit facility would
be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable. To avoid such a
default, a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would
restrict our operational and financing flexibility.

Our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various
risks and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significant
write-down of our goodwill. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our
business by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we
may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete.

32

Table of Contents

Disruptions  in  the  capital  markets  or  changes  in  our  credit  ratings  could  also  limit  our  ability  to  access  capital  on  terms  favorable  to  us  or  at  all.  For
example, on April 1, 2019, Moody’s Investors Service changed the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1, from A3, with a stable outlook. While the
lending banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, or
deterioration  of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the
terms of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. These or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments, and we
may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or capital markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain,
renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity.  Longer-term  disruptions  in  the  capital  and  credit  markets  as  a  result  of  economic,  legislative,  political  or  other  uncertainty,  including  as  a  result  of
changes in U.S. tax and other laws, reduced financing alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity
needed  for  our  business.  Any  significant  disruption  in  the  capital,  debt  or  credit  markets,  or  financial  institution  failures  could  require  us  to  take  measures  to
conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, reducing or
suspending  dividend  payments,  and  reducing  other  discretionary  expenditures.  Finally,  there  is  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  access  the  equity  capital
markets to obtain financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us.

Any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets, or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from
financial market disruptions, could expose us to increased interest expense, require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Parent company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to
pay upstream dividends or repay funds.

Parent  company  is  a  holding  company  and,  as  such,  it  has  no  substantive  operations  of  its  own.  Substantially  all  of  our  consolidated  assets  are  held  by
subsidiaries. Parent company’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash
flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company. Prior to paying dividends to parent company, our
regulated  subsidiaries  must  comply  with  applicable  regulatory  restrictions  and  financial  obligations,  including,  for  example,  debt  service  and  preferred  and
preference  stock  dividends,  as  well  as  applicable  corporate,  tax  and  other  laws  and  regulations  and  agreements,  and  our  covenants  and  other  agreements.  Our
subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to
pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent company’s ability to pay dividends on its
common stock and meet its other obligations.

We may not be able to fully utilize our U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards.

As  of  December  31,  2019,  we  had  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOL  carryforwards  of  approximately  $673  million and  $453  million,  respectively,  and
management  believes  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  these  NOL  carryforwards  will  be  recovered  in  the  future.  With  the  enactment  of  the  TCJA,  the  Company
analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, including
its NOL carryforwards, and as a result, remeasured those NOL carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the TCJA based on this tax rate change.

Our federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028, and our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2019 and will continue to expire through
2038. We expect to fully utilize our federal NOL balance before it expires, and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient
taxable income. We have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards, and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in
the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income.

Our  actual  results  may  differ  from  those  estimated  by  management  in  making  its  assessment  as  to  our  ability  to  use  the  NOL carryforwards.  Moreover,
adoption of Related Interpretations with respect to the TCJA and other changes in income tax laws, the economy and the general business environment could affect
the  future  utilization  of  our  NOL  carryforwards.  If  we  are  unable  to  fully  utilize  our  NOL  carryforwards  to  offset  taxable  income  generated  in  the  future,  our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that may
negatively affect our results of operations.

Our total assets include $1.5 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2019. The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an
affiliate of our previous owner in 2003, the acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and our acquisition of Pivotal in
2018. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill
is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not
be recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, we have taken significant non-cash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the
past.

We  may  be  required  to  recognize  an  impairment  of  goodwill  in  the  future  due  to  market  conditions  or  other  factors  related  to  our  performance  or  the
performance of an acquired business. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time in
valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases in
control premiums, or other circumstances.  For example,  in the third quarter of 2018, prior to our sale of Keystone, we strategically  narrowed the scope of that
business and, as a result, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $57 million. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, could
also result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred,
which may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment could be material and could
make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of
our regulators.

Market volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which may
require us to provide significant additional funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and
postretirement  benefit  plans.  The  value  of  these  assets  is  subject  to  market  fluctuations  and  volatility,  which  may  cause  investment  returns  to  fall  below  our
projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension
and  postretirement  benefit  plans.  Additionally,  our  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  plan  liabilities  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  interest  rates.  If  interest  rates
decrease, our liabilities would increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, such as increases in
life  expectancy  assumptions  and  increasing  trends  in  health  care  costs  may  also  increase  our  funding  requirements.  Future  increases  in  pension  and  other
postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position could be
negatively affected.

In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans. For
example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent that
market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

New  accounting  standards  or  changes  to  existing  accounting  standards  could  materially  impact  how  we  report  our  results  of  operations,  cash  flow  and
financial condition.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative
bodies  or  governmental  entities  may  issue  new  pronouncements  or  new  interpretations  of  existing  accounting  standards  that  may  require  us  to  change  our
accounting policies. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash
flow  and financial  condition.  We  could  be  required  to  apply  a  new or  revised  standard  retroactively,  which  could also  adversely  affect  our previously  reported
results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

Undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.

Our internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and
information  in  a  timely  and  accurate  manner  in  compliance  with  GAAP,  taxation  requirements,  federal  securities  laws  and  regulations  and  other  laws  and
regulations  applicable  to  us.  Such  compliance  permits  us  to,  among  other  things,  disclose  and  report  financial  and  other  information  in  connection  with  the
recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations.

Table of Contents

We have implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the  “Sarbanes-Oxley  Act”)  and  relevant  SEC  rules,  as  well  as  other  applicable  regulations.  Such  internal  controls  and  policies  have  been  and  continue  to  be
closely  monitored  by  our  management  and  Board  of  Directors  to  ensure  continued  compliance  with  these  laws,  rules  and  regulations.  Management  is  also
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. While
we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary
lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery
and non-compliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could
also harm our reputation, increase financing costs or adversely affect our or AWCC’s ability to access the capital markets.

Additional Risks Related to Our Market-Based Businesses

We  (excluding  our  regulated  subsidiaries)  provide  performance  guarantees  with  respect  to  certain  obligations  of  our  Market-Based Businesses, including
financial guarantees or deposits, to our public-sector and public clients, and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our Market-Based Businesses
do not satisfy these obligations.

Under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities, other governmental entities
and  other  customers,  American  Water  (excluding  our  regulated  subsidiaries)  provides  guarantees  of  specified  performance  obligations  of  our  Market-Based
Businesses, including financial guarantees or deposits, primarily related to MSG. In the event our Market-Based Businesses fail to perform these obligations, the
entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against American Water (excluding our regulated subsidiaries) or proceed against
the deposit. In that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected.

At December 31, 2019, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately $5.4 billion related
to MSG’s contracts, and this amount is likely to increase if the number of bases served by MSG increases. The presence of these commitments  may adversely
affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms.

Our Market-Based Businesses’ operations under MSG are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the U.S. government.

MSG  enters  into  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  contracts  may  be
terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the
subsidiary  performing  the  contract.  In  addition,  the  contract  price  for  each  of  these  military  contracts  is  typically  subject  to  either  an  annual  economic  price
adjustment, or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. Annual economic price adjustment is an inflation
index-based contract price increase mechanism. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect
changes  in  contract  obligations  and  anticipated  market  conditions.  Any  early  contract  termination  or  unfavorable  annual  economic  price  adjustment  or  price
redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Moreover, entering into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the level
of  government  spending  and  compliance  with  and  changes  in  governmental  procurement  and  security  regulations.  We  are  subject  to  potential  government
investigations  of  our  business  practices  and  compliance  with  government  procurement  and  security  regulations,  which  are  complex,  and  compliance  with  these
regulations can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or barred from bidding
on or receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and cash flows.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions

Compliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions

Under the 2009 Order, Cal Am is required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a
set reduction schedule. The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water
from the Carmel River as required by a 1995 order of the SWRCB. In July 2016, at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies, the
SWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving the 2021 Deadline.

The 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased use
of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a decision
directing  modifications  in Cal Am’s tariffs  to recognize  the moratorium  mandated  by the 2009 Order, and directing  Cal Am to seek written guidance from the
SWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter to
Cal  Am  providing  an  interpretation  as  to  the  calculation  of  a  baseline  to  determine  increases  in  use  of  water  at  existing  service  addresses.  In  March  2018,  the
MPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCB’s written interpretation. In May 2018, Cal
Am notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. In
an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. The
SWRCB agreed to circulate  revisions to its 2012 interpretive  letter, which would be subject to a public comment period. Any failure to follow the MPWMD’s
resolution or the SWRCB’s written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and other actions against Cal
Am.

36

Table of Contents

The 2016 Order provides that if the CPUC authorizes Cal Am to acquire more than 1,000 acre-feet per year of water from a source other than the Water
Supply Project, proponents of the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the SWRCB for consideration. In May 2018, certain parties to the
Water Supply Project proceeding submitted a petition to the SWRCB to add parallel milestones to the 2009 Order for 2019, 2020, and 2021, based on the proposed
expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project, another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the Monterey peninsula. Petitioners claim that
compliance with the alternate  milestones would still provide for cessation  of Cal Am’s unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River by 2021. A preliminary
report on feasibility concluded that the expanded Pure Water Monterey project could provide an additional 2,250 acre-feet of water per year. Cal Am believes that
(i) the petition is premature, (ii) the expanded Pure Water Monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and, even if construction is
successfully  completed,  would  provide  an  insufficient  quantity  of  water  to  allow  full  compliance  with  the  2009  Order,  and  (iii)  the  imposition  of  parallel
milestones would distract from completion of the Water Supply Project. On December 13, 2019, the SWRCB dismissed the petition without prejudice.

Cal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for
the Water Supply Project. However, based on the matters discussed below in “Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project,” there can be no assurance that the Water
Supply  Project  in  its  current  configuration  will  be  completed  on  a  timely  basis,  if  ever.  Due  to  the  delay  in  the  approval  schedule,  Cal  Am  currently  does  not
believe that it will be able to fully comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order,
including  the  2021  Deadline.  The  CPUC’s  final  decision  approving  the  Water  Supply  Project  permits  recovery  of  all  of  Cal  Am’s  prudently  incurred  costs
associated therewith, subject to the frameworks set forth in the final decision related to cost caps, O&M costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters.  Cal
Am  currently  believes  that  its  expenditures  to  date  have  been  prudent  and  necessary  to  comply  with  the  2009  Order  and  the  2016  Order.    Further  attempts  to
comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, or the 2021 Deadline, may result in material additional costs or obligations to Cal Am, and failure to comply
could lead to fines and penalties against Cal Am.

Regional Desalination Project Litigation

Review of CPUC-Approved Settlement Agreement

The Regional Desalination Project (the “RDP”) involved the construction of a desalination facility in the City of Marina, north of Monterey. The RDP was
intended  to,  among  other  things,  eliminate  unauthorized  diversions  from  the  Carmel  River  as  required  under  the  2009  Order.  In  December  2010,  the  CPUC
approved  the  RDP,  which  was  to  be  implemented  through  a  Water  Purchase  Agreement  and  ancillary  agreements  (collectively,  the  “Agreements”)  among  the
Marina  Coast  Water  District  (“MCWD”),  the  Monterey  County  Water  Resources  Agency  (“MCWRA”)  and  Cal  Am.  In  2011,  due  to  a  conflict  of  interest
concerning  a  former  member  of  MCWRA’s  Board  of  Directors,  MCWRA  stated  that  the  Agreements  were  void,  and,  as  a  result,  Cal  Am  terminated  the
Agreements. In April 2015, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among Cal Am, MCWRA and the County of Monterey to resolve these matters among the
parties signing the agreement. In March 2016, the Supreme Court of California granted MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC approval, and following the
court’s disposition of a related issue in another case, MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC-approved settlement agreement was remanded to the CPUC. On
September 19, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision affirming  its prior decisions with respect to the settlement  agreement that resolved matters among the parties
thereto associated with the termination of the RDP agreements, after considering the issue remanded by the California Supreme Court.

Cal Am’s Action for Damages Following RDP Termination

In October 2012, Cal Am filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief against MCWRA and MCWD, which was ultimately transferred to the San Francisco
County Superior Court, seeking a determination as to whether the Agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest. In June 2015, the court entered
a final judgment agreeing with Cal Am’s position that four of the five Agreements are void, and one, the credit line agreement, is not void. In November 2016, the
Supreme  Court  of  California  denied  MCWD’s  final  appeal  of  this  judgment,  which  allows  further  proceedings,  discussed  below,  to  determine  the  amount  of
damages that may be awarded in the proceeding.

In  July  2015,  Cal  Am  and  MCWRA  filed  a  Complaint  in  San  Francisco  County  Superior  Court  against  MCWD  and  RMC  Water  and  Environment
(“RMC”),  a  private  engineering  consulting  firm  which  has  since  been  acquired  by  a  national  engineering,  science  and  operations  company,  seeking  to  recover
compensatory damages in excess of $10 million associated with the failure of the RDP, as well as punitive and treble damages, statutory penalties and attorneys’
fees. Shortly thereafter, complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court by MCWD and RMC against Cal Am and MCWRA in excess of $19
million in the aggregate. In December 2015, the court consolidated all of these complaints into a single action. On February 15, 2019, the court granted Cal Am’s
motion for summary judgment, and as a result, no claims remain pending against Cal Am in this action. On February 25, 2019, the court granted RMC’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to certain of Cal Am’s tort claims against it. On June 20, 2019, the court granted MCWD’s motion for summary judgment related to
Cal Am’s tort claims against MCWD, which Cal Am appealed to the California Court of Appeal, and on January 14, 2020, this appeal was denied. On January 17,
2019, a motion filed by MCWD for summary judgment against Cal Am relating to the contract claims in Cal Am’s complaint was denied.

Table of Contents

Trial in this lawsuit had been scheduled to take place in January 2020. On January 27, 2020, the parties to this lawsuit reached a tentative agreement, which
was entered into the court record and would resolve the litigation in part without trial. Under the terms of this tentative agreement, MCWD and RMC would pay
Cal  Am  an  aggregate  of  $5.2  million  in  settlement  of  Cal  Am’s  contract  claims  against  MCWD  and  all  claims  against  RMC  relating  to  the  RDP.  Under  this
agreement, Cal Am’s and MCWRA’s right to appeal the dismissal of their tort claims against MCWD would be expressly reserved. A draft settlement agreement is
being reviewed and negotiated by the parties. Once executed, the settlement agreement would be subject to approval of the San Francisco County Superior Court.

Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project

CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project

Cal  Am’s  ability  to  move  forward  on  the  Water  Supply  Project  is  and  has  been  subject  to  extensive  administrative  review  by  the  CPUC  and  other
government  agencies,  obtaining  necessary  permits,  and  intervention  from  other  parties.  In  September  2016,  the  CPUC  unanimously  approved  a  decision  to
authorize  Cal  Am  to  enter  into  a  water  purchase  agreement  for  the  GWR  Project  and  to  construct  a  pipeline  and  pump  station  facilities  and  recover  up to  $50
million in associated costs, subject to meeting certain criteria. If construction costs exceed $50 million, Cal Am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery.

In September 2018, the CPUC unanimously adopted a final decision finding that (i) the Water Supply Project, based on Cal Am’s request for a 6.4 million
gallons per day desalination plant, meets the CPUC’s requirements for a CPCN, (ii) the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed, and (iii) an additional
procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative  projects. The CPUC’s decision directs Cal Am to enter into negotiations regarding expansion of the
GWR  Project  between  Monterey  One  Water  and  the  MPWMD  and  to  indicate  whether  Cal  Am  plans  to  file  an  application  for  approval  of  an  agreement  to
purchase additional water from the GWR Project. The decision notes, however, that the CPUC will only consider such an application if the Water Supply Project is
delayed  such  that  Cal  Am  would  not  be  able  to  meet  the  2021  Deadline.  The  decision  accepts  Cal  Am’s  estimates  of  future  water  demand  in  Monterey  and
concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address those needs, and adopts Cal Am’s most recent cost estimates. The decision also allows Cal
Am  to  earn  an  allowance  for  funds  used  during  construction,  or  AFUDC,  at  a  rate  representative  of  its  actual  financing  costs.  The  final  decision  adopted
frameworks as to cost caps, O&M costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters.

In  addition,  the  CPUC  final  decision  imposes  numerous  reporting  and  filing  requirements  to  ensure  the  expenditures  for  the  Water  Supply  Project  are
reasonable, including that the financing is the lowest cost and most beneficial for ratepayers, and that construction is progressing in a timely manner and within the
authorized  cost  caps.  The  reasonableness  of  Water  Supply  Project  costs  will  be  reviewed  in  the  first  general  rate  case  filed  by  Cal  Am  after  the  Water  Supply
Project becomes operational. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the
construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC
costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service.

In February 2019, the City of Marina and MCWD filed petitions for writ of review before the Supreme Court of California challenging the sufficiency of
the final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement adopted by the CPUC in September 2018, which the court declined to consider on August
28, 2019.

On  July  2,  2019,  Cal  Am  notified  MPWMD  and  Monterey  One  Water  (collectively,  the  “Agencies”)  that  an  event  of  default  occurred  under  the  water
purchase agreement for the GWR Project because the Agencies failed to deliver to Cal Am by July 1, 2019 advanced treated recycled water produced by the GWR
Project.  Under  the  water  purchase  agreement,  upon  the  occurrence  of  this  event  of  default,  Cal  Am  had  the  right  to  terminate  the  water  purchase  agreement
immediately. Cal Am has elected not to exercise its right to terminate the water purchase agreement at this time, but in its notification to the Agencies, Cal Am
expressly reserved its right to terminate the water purchase agreement until such time as the Agencies commence their required delivery of water from the GWR
Project. On July 16, 2019, MPWMD and Monterey One Water responded to Cal Am’s event of default notice and estimated that water delivery would begin by
mid-October 2019. On December 12, 2019, Cal Am sent a letter to the Agencies requesting a status update with respect to the event of default. On January 2, 2020,
Cal Am notified the Agencies that a second event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement because the Agencies failed to achieve the Performance
Start Date (the date upon which MPWMD’s performance obligations under the water purchase agreement were to commence) by January 1, 2020. Under the water
purchase  agreement,  upon  the  occurrence  of  this  event  of  default,  Cal  Am  had  the  right  to  terminate  the  water  purchase  agreement  immediately.  Cal  Am  has
elected not to exercise its right to terminate the water purchase agreement at this time, but in its notification to the Agencies, Cal Am expressly reserved its right to
terminate  the water purchase agreement  until such time as the Performance  Start Date has occurred.  On January 9, 2020, the Agencies responded to Cal Am’s
December  12,  2019  and  January  2,  2020  letters.  In  the  response,  the  Agencies  acknowledged  they  remain  in  default  under  the  water  purchase  agreement  but
indicated that corrective action is being taken to attain the Performance Start Date in the near future.

On  April  17,  2019,  Water  Ratepayers  Association  of  the  Monterey  Peninsula  (“WRAMP”),  a  citizens’  advocacy  group,  filed  an  amended  complaint  in
Monterey County Superior Court asserting a “qui tam” claim under the California False Claims Act on behalf of itself and the State of California against Cal Am
and certain environmental consultants who worked on the CPUC’s environmental analysis of the MPWSP. The State Attorney General declined to proceed with
this  action  after  it  was  originally  filed  in  2016.  On  July  10,  2019,  defendants  filed  a  joint  demurrer  challenging  the  legal  sufficiency  of  the  allegations  of  the
amended complaint. At an August 27, 2019 hearing on the demurrer, the court dismissed the petition without leave to amend. On October 17, 2019, WRAMP filed
motions seeking clarification and a reconsideration of the court’s ruling. A hearing on these motions was set for December 3, 2019, but on November 26, 2019,
WRAMP abandoned its motions and instead filed an appeal of the court’s dismissal. This appeal remains pending.

Coastal Development Permit Application

In June 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina for those project components of the Water Supply Project
located within the City of Marina’s coastal zone. Members of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed opposition
to  the  Water  Supply Project.  On March  7, 2019,  the City  of  Marina  Planning  Commission  adopted  a  resolution  denying  Cal  Am’s  coastal  development  permit
application. Cal Am appealed the Marina Planning Commission's decision to the City Council, which set a public hearing on the appeal for April 30, 2019. On
April 25, 2019, Cal Am submitted a letter to the City challenging the impartiality of the City and three of its council members with respect to the Water Supply
Project.  On  April  29,  2019,  the  City  informed  Cal  Am  that  it  intended  to  proceed  with  the  hearing  with  the  participation  of  the  challenged  City  Council
members. As a result, on April 29, 2019, Cal Am notified the City that it was withdrawing its appeal, as Cal Am believes it could not receive a fair and impartial
hearing before the City Council.

On  May  10,  2019,  the  City  issued  a  notice  of  final  local  action  based  upon  the  Marina  Planning  Commission’s  decision.  On  May  22,  2019,  Cal  Am
appealed this decision to the California Coastal Commission (the “Coastal Commission”), as permitted under the City’s code and the California Coastal Act. On
October 28, 2019, staff of the Coastal Commission issued a report recommending a denial of Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit with respect to
the Water Supply Project, largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the MPWMD that contradicted findings made by the CPUC in its
final  decision  approving  the  Water  Supply  Project.  Staffs  of  the  CPUC  and  the  Coastal  Commission  met  to  discuss  the  Coastal  Commission’s  staff
recommendation, at which time the CPUC raised questions about the Coastal Commission staff’s findings on water supply and demand, groundwater impacts and
other matters. On November 4, 2019, Coastal Commission staff released an addendum to the staff report, concluding that additional groundwater modeling was
needed before staff could find that the Water Supply Project would not prevent depletion of groundwater supplies. At its November 14, 2019 hearing on both the
appeal from the City of Marina’s denial and Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction, Coastal
Commission staff advised that no vote would be taken at the meeting and that further investigation was required in light of the CPUC staff’s questions. The hearing
was continued to a later date. On January 28, 2020, Coastal Commission staff recommended to Cal Am that it withdraw its application for a coastal development
permit  within  the  Coastal  Commission’s  original  jurisdiction  and  resubmit  such  application  at  a  later  date,  as  the  staff  believes  that  its  additional  investigation
could not be completed in time for a vote on Cal Am’s existing application. The staff indicated that such a withdrawal would not affect Cal Am’s appeal of the City
of Marin’s denial, which would remain  pending. Cal Am has declined to withdraw its application, and instead, on February 12, 2020, Cal Am and the Coastal
Commission entered into a stipulation extending by 90 days, to July 24, 2020, the deadline for the Coastal Commission to vote on Cal Am’s original jurisdiction
application.

Desalination Plant Development Permit

The proposed desalination plant for the Water Supply Project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of Monterey County, California on a site owned
by CEMEX, Inc. (“CEMEX”), and requires a combined development permit from the County of Monterey prior to commencement of construction. On April 24,
2019, the County’s Planning Commission voted to approve the permit. On July 15, 2019, the Board of Supervisors heard appeals filed by MCWD and a public
advocacy group, at which time it denied the appeals and approved the permit. On August 21, 2019, MCWD filed a petition in Monterey County Superior Court
challenging Monterey County’s approval of Cal Am’s combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Monterey County and Cal
Am  from  commencing  construction  of  the  desalination  plant.  On  October  9,  2019,  after  a  hearing,  the  court  denied,  without  prejudice,  MCWD’s  motion  for  a
preliminary injunction, but issued a stay of the County’s approval of the combined development permit, precluding commencement of physical construction of the
desalination plant until November 19, 2019, at which time the parties were to advise the court of the Coastal Commission’s decision on Cal Am’s application for a
coastal development permit for the slant wells needed to source water for the desalination plant. In the interim, Cal Am is allowed to continue to obtain permits
needed  for  the  desalination  plant’s  construction.  On  November  19,  2019,  the  parties  informed  the  court  that  the  Coastal  Commission  had  continued  its  public
hearing on the slant wells and had not yet made a determination about permitting the slant wells. In response, the court continued its stay until March 24, 2020.

Proposed Zoning Changes at CEMEX Site for Slant Wells

In August 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed the matter
for consideration on the Planning Commission’s agenda for its September 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the CEMEX site to
open space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Any change to the
City's  local  coastal  program  must  ultimately  be  approved  by  the  Coastal  Commission.  Cal  Am,  CEMEX  and  the  Coastal  Commission  each  submitted  letters
opposing the proposed amendments. At its November 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the Marina City Council
consider approving the amendments.

In December 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission again submitted letters
opposing  the  proposed  changes,  but  the  City  Council  unanimously  adopted  a  resolution  amending  its  local  coastal  plan  and  a  draft  amendment  to  its  zoning
ordinance. Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final, which occurred at the City’s December 2018 meeting. The changes to the
local coastal plan must be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained.

Test Slant Well Permitting

A preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of
the  property  on  which  intake  wells  will  be  located  to  draw  water  from  under  Monterey  Bay.  In  November  2014,  the  Coastal  Commission  approved  coastal
development permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well. Because Cal Am may use the test slant well as one of the
slant wells for the Water Supply Project, Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain in
place and be maintained until February 28, 2020. On November 27, 2019, Cal Am filed an application with the Coastal Commission for a permit amendment to
allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until February 28, 2021. A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission, as
amended, will expire on December 16, 2022. Effective February 28, 2018, test slant well pumping ceased, except for minimal maintenance pumping activities, in
accordance with Cal Am’s coastal development permits.

In November 2015, MCWD filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Santa Cruz County Superior Court
against the Coastal Commission and Cal Am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test well
pumping. In orders issued in September 2016 and October 2017, the court denied MCWD’s challenges. In January 2018, MCWD filed a notice of appeal of the
court’s judgment. On June 28, 2019, the California Court of Appeal dismissed MCWD’s appeal. On July 15, 2019, MCWD filed a petition for rehearing with the
Court of Appeal, which was denied on July 19, 2019. This decision is now final.

Water Supply Project Land Acquisition and Slant Well Site Use

In July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned by
CEMEX  on  which  intake  wells  for  the  Water  Supply  Project  will  be  located,  to  cease  by  the  end  of  2020  and  the  property  to  be  sold  to  either  a  non-profit  or
governmental entity. The consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent
with existing easements and other rights of record. A permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am was recorded in June 2018 to allow Cal Am access to the
property and to construct, operate and maintain the Water Supply Project intake wells. On November 26, 2019, the City of Marina notified CEMEX that, based on
this easement and Cal Am’s proposed use of the site for the intake wells, CEMEX has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement (to which
Cal Am was not a party). The City states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from CEMEX and Cal Am ordering that Cal Am’s extraction is limited to 500
acre-feet per year of groundwater, that Cal Am cannot export extracted water out of the basin, and that the permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am is
void. The City has requested a meeting with CEMEX as part of a mandatory dispute resolution process under the annexation agreement prior to filing a lawsuit.
CEMEX has denied the City’s claims and requested indemnification from Cal Am under the terms of the permanent easement. Cal Am and CEMEX believe that
there is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on Cal Am’s right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the site for desalination and use by
Cal Am’s customers.

Under  California’s  Sustainable  Groundwater  Management  Act  (“SGMA”)  enacted  in  2015,  groundwater  basins  designated  by  the  state  as  critically
overdrafted must be managed by a groundwater sustainability agency (“GSA”) by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan (“GSP”)
designed  to  achieve  sustainability  by  2040.  Under  the  SGMA,  GSAs  have  broad  powers  to  achieve  sustainability  including,  but  not  limited  to,  regulating
groundwater  extraction  by  imposing  fees  on  groundwater  extractions  and  controlling  groundwater  extractions  by  regulating,  limiting  or  suspending  extractions
from  wells.  The  400-acre  CEMEX  site  overlies  a  small  portion  of  the  180/400  Subbasin  of  the  Salinas  Valley  Groundwater  Basin;  the  84,000-acre  180/400
Subbasin has been designated by the state as critically overdrafted, mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin.

Table of Contents

In late 2016, the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (“SVBGSA”) was formed as a joint powers authority to become the GSA for the
Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin and prepare a GSP. In April 2018, the City of Marina filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site, creating an overlap
with the SVBGSA’s filing for the 180/400 Subbasin. In 2016, the SVBGSA commenced preparation of a GSP covering the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the
CEMEX site, but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX site with the intent to severely limit or prohibit
groundwater pumping at that site. The State Department of Water Resources (“SDWR”) has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved, it will not accept
the GSP from either agency, placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management. In December 2019, the County
of  Monterey  filed  its  own  notice  to  become  the  exclusive  GSA  at  the  CEMEX  site  in  order  to  resolve  the  overlap,  which  is  permitted  under  SGMA.  SDWR
accepted the County’s filing on December 18, 2019, and now lists the County as the exclusive GSA for the site.

On December 30, 2019, the City of Marina filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of California challenging the County’s filing, and SDWR’s acceptance of
the filing, as the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site. The City has named the County and its Board of Supervisors, the County GSA, and SDWR and its director as
defendants, and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. The City seeks to invalidate the County’s filing, as well as injunctive relief to preserve the
City’s status as a GSA for the site. To protect its interest in the matter, Cal Am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit, which is scheduled to be heard on
February 18, 2020.

Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation

On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of
WVAWC’s West  Relay pumping  station  located  in the  City of Dunbar. The failure  of the main  caused  water  outages  and low pressure  to up to approximately
25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,
2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20%
by  the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  was
reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully
restored on July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by this event.

On June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha
County on behalf of an alleged  class of residents  and business owners who lost water service  or pressure  as a result of the Dunbar main break.  The complaint
alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence
by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost
profits, annoyance and inconvenience,  and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe
failure and a large outage.

In  October  2017,  WVAWC  filed  with  the  court  a  motion  seeking  to  dismiss  all  of  the  Jeffries plaintiffs’  counts alleging  statutory  and common  law tort
claims.  Furthermore,  WVAWC  asserted  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia,  and  not  the  court,  has  primary  jurisdiction  over  allegations
involving violations of the applicable tariff, the public utility code and related rules. In May 2018, the court, at a hearing, denied WVAWC’s motion to apply the
primary  jurisdiction  doctrine,  and  in  October  2018,  the  court  issued  a  written  order  to  that  effect.  On  February  21,  2019,  the  court  issued  an  order  denying
WVAWC’s motion  to dismiss  the Jeffries plaintiffs’  tort  claims.  On August 21, 2019, the  court  set  a  procedural  schedule  in this  case,  including  a  trial  date  of
September 21, 2020. Discovery in this case is ongoing. On February 4, 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach
of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. A hearing on class certification is
currently scheduled for March 11, 2020.

The Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC will continue

to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.

Chattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Action Litigation

On September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“TAWC”), experienced a break of a 36-inch
water transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main
break by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon on September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all
customers on September 16, 2019.

On September  17, 2019, a complaint  captioned  Bruce,  et  al.  v.  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.,  et al.  was  filed  in  the  Circuit  Court  of  Hamilton
County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and the Service Company (collectively, the “Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of an alleged
class  of  individuals  or  entities  who  lost  water  service  or  suffered  monetary  losses  as  a  result  of  the  Chattanooga  main  break  (the  “Tennessee  Plaintiffs”).  The
complaint alleges breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate
veil. The Tennessee Plaintiffs seek an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use
and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest.

On November 22, 2019, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief

may be granted, and, with respect to the Company, for lack of personal jurisdiction. A hearing on this motion is scheduled for February 18, 2020.

The  Tennessee-American  Water  Defendants  believe  that  they  have  meritorious  defenses  to  the  claims  raised  in  this  class  action  complaint,  and  they  are

vigorously defending themselves against these allegations.

CSG — East Palo Alto Water System Voluntary Report

In April 2017, AWE, the parent entity of CSG, voluntarily reported to the Division of Drinking Water of the SWRCB potential violations of the California
Safe Drinking Water Act (the “CSDWA”) in connection with AWE’s operation of the City of East Palo Alto’s water distribution system. Upon the resignation of
the  system’s  general  manager  in  March  2017,  AWE  discovered  that  it  may  have  operated  the  system  without  a  properly  certified  operator  for  two  years,  the
triennial LCR sampling was not completed, and the 2015 Consumer Confidence Report improperly reported data for lead and copper samples from the system’s
upstream water provider. Promptly after discovering these issues, AWE engaged an outside law firm to conduct an internal investigation and reported the results of
that investigation to the SWRCB.

On  June  15,  2017,  the  SWRCB  issued  to  AWE  a  citation  that  required  AWE  to,  among  other  things:  comply  with  regulations  related  to  water  operator
certifications, lead and copper tap sampling requirements and the publishing of a Consumer Confidence Report; provide public notification of the LCR violation;
and  prepare  a  corrective  action  plan  to  evaluate  the  causes  leading  to  these  incidents  and  measures  to  be  taken  to  prevent  recurrence  of  future  incidents.  The
citation did not impose on AWE any monetary penalties, but the SWRCB reserved the right to take additional enforcement action.

In October 2017, the SWRCB advised AWE that it is in compliance with all of the directives and relevant statutory and administrative provisions specified
in the SWRCB’s June 2017 citation. In February 2018, the SWRCB referred this matter to the San Mateo County, California District Attorney’s office for further
investigation. AWE continues to cooperate with the SWRCB, the City of East Palo Alto and the San Mateo County District Attorney regarding this matter. Proven
violations of the CSDWA may result in civil and criminal penalties.

General

Periodically, the Company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than those proceedings described
in this Item 3—Legal Proceedings, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect its financial position or results
of operations. However, litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance.
It  is  possible  that  some  litigation  and  other  proceedings  could  be  decided  unfavorably  to  the  Company,  and  that  any  such  unfavorable  decisions  could  have  a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

MARKET  FOR  REGISTRANT’S  COMMON  EQUITY,  RELATED  STOCKHOLDER  MATTERS  AND  ISSUER  PURCHASES  OF
EQUITY SECURITIES

Since April 23, 2008, the Company’s common stock has traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “AWK.” As of February 13,
2020,  there  were  180,974,719 shares  of  common  stock  outstanding  held  by  approximately  2,546 record  holders.  Holders  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  are
entitled  to  receive  dividends  when  they  are  declared  by  its  Board  of  Directors.  See  Note  9—Shareholders’  Equity in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s dividends.

In February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued through the
Company’s dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the Company to purchase up to 10 million
shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The
program  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  Rule  10b-18  of  the  Exchange  Act,  and,  to  facilitate  these  repurchases,  the  Company  enters  into  Rule  10b5-1  stock
repurchase plans with a third-party broker, which allow the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from
doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations, the Company may elect to amend or
cancel the program or the stock repurchase parameters at its discretion to manage dilution.

From  April  1,  2015,  the  date  repurchases  under  the  anti-dilutive  stock  repurchase  program  commenced,  through  December  31,  2019,  the  Company
repurchased an aggregate of 4,860,000 shares of its common stock under the program, including 350,000 shares repurchased during the first quarter of 2019. There
were no repurchases of common stock in the last three quarters of 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $3.43, an increase of $0.28 per diluted share compared to the prior year,

which includes the net adjustments presented in the table above and discussed in greater detail in the “Adjustments to GAAP” section below.

Excluding the net adjustments presented in the table above, adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were $3.61 for the year ended  December 31,

2019, an increase of $0.31 per diluted share compared to the prior year.

These results were driven by continued growth in the Regulated Businesses from infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth, and growth in
the Market-Based Businesses, primarily from HOS’s 2018 acquisition of Pivotal and from MSG’s addition of two new military contracts in 2018 (Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base and Fort Leonard Wood).

Table of Contents

Adjustments to GAAP

Adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a non-GAAP financial measure and, as shown in the table above, is calculated as GAAP diluted earnings per
share, excluding the impact of one or more of the following events: (i) a loss on the sale in the fourth quarter of 2019 of the Keystone operations; (ii) previously
reported settlement activities related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia; (iii) a gain recognized in the third quarter of 2018 on the sale of the
majority of CSG’s O&M contracts; (iv) a goodwill and intangible impairment charge in the third quarter of 2018 related to the Keystone operations; (v) an early
extinguishment of debt charge at parent company in the third quarter of 2017; and (vi) non-cash re-measurement charges recorded in the fourth quarters of 2017
and  2018 resulting  from  the  impact  of  the  change  in the  federal  corporate  income  tax  rate  on the  Company’s  deferred  income  taxes  from  the  enactment  of  the
TCJA.

The Company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful information by excluding certain matters that may not be indicative of
its  ongoing  operating  results,  and  that  providing  this  non-GAAP  measure  will  allow  investors  to  better  understand  the  businesses’  operating  performance  and
facilitate a meaningful year-to-year comparison of the Company’s results of operations. Although management uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally to
evaluate  its  results  of  operations,  the  Company  does  not  intend  results  reflected  by  this  non-GAAP  measure  to  represent  results  as  defined  by  GAAP,  and  the
reader  should  not  consider  them  as  indicators  of  performance.  This  non-GAAP  financial  measure  is  derived  from  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial
information but is not presented in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a
substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure as defined and used above,
may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, may have significant limitations on its use.

Growth—through  capital  investment  in  infrastructure  and  regulated  acquisitions,  as  well  as  strategic  growth  opportunities  in  the  Market-Based
Businesses

The Company expects to continue to grow its businesses, with the majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued
capital investment in the Company’s infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulated
acquisitions to expand the Company’s services to new customers. The Company also expects to continue to grow the Market-Based Businesses, which leverages
its core water and wastewater competencies. In 2019, the Company invested $1.9 billion, primarily in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below:

Regulated Businesses Growth and Optimization

•

•

•

$1.7 billion capital investment in the Regulated Businesses, the majority for infrastructure improvements and replacements.

$235 million to fund acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 53,100 water and wastewater customers.

The Company has entered into agreements for pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to add approximately 44,200 customers.

On  November  20,  2019,  the  Company  and  its  New  York  subsidiary  entered  into  a  Stock  Purchase  Agreement  with  Liberty  Utilities  Co.  (“Liberty”),
pursuant  to  which  Liberty  will  purchase  all  of  the  capital  stock  of  the  New  York  subsidiary  (the  “Stock  Purchase”)  for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of
approximately $608 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided in that agreement. The New York subsidiary includes all of the water and wastewater assets
of  the  Company’s  New  York  regulated  utility  operations,  with  approximately  125,000 customer  connections  in  the  State  of  New  York.  Algonquin  Power  &
Utilities Corp., Liberty’s parent company, executed and delivered an absolute and unconditional guaranty of the performance of all of Liberty’s obligations under
the stock purchase agreement.

The Stock Purchase is subject to various conditions, including obtaining regulatory approval, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law and other customary closing conditions. The stock purchase agreement may be terminated  by either party if the
Stock Purchase is not completed by June 30, 2021, subject to extension for up to six months if all of the conditions to closing have been met, other than obtaining
regulatory  approvals.  Liberty  may  also  terminate  the  stock  purchase  agreement  if  any  governmental  authority  initiates  a  condemnation  or  eminent  domain
proceeding  against  a  majority  of  the  consolidated  properties  of  the  New  York  subsidiary,  taken  as  a  whole.  The  Company  currently  estimates  that  the  Stock
Purchase  is  to  be  completed  by  early  2021.  Accordingly,  the  assets  and  related  liabilities  of  the  New  York  subsidiary  were  classified  as  held  for  sale  on
the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  as  of  December  31,  2019.  See  Note  4—Acquisitions  and  Divestitures in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for
additional information.

Market-Based Businesses Growth and Optimization

During January 2020, HOS was selected by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (“SFPUC”) to offer optional water line and sewer line protection
services to homeowners across the City and County of San Francisco. This arrangement provides over 100,000 eligible San Francisco homeowners, served by the
SFPUC, the opportunity to purchase optional protection plans from the Company for the water line that runs from a residential property to the connection with the
water meter and the sewer line that runs from the residential property to the sewer main.

MSG was awarded contracts for ownership, operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, effective
September 26, 2019, and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, effective  September 30, 2019. Highlights of these contract awards are
detailed below:

•

•

Joint Base San Antonio is comprised of Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis and Lackland Air Force Base. The installation
spans  46,539  acres,  across  11  geographically  separated  parcels  of  land.  The  contract  award  includes  estimated  revenues  of  approximately  $448
million over a 50-year period, subject to an annual economic price adjustment.

The  United  States  Military  Academy  is  located  at  West  Point,  New  York,  the  oldest  continuously  operated  Army  post  in  the  United  States.  The
institution’s campus, central post and training areas expand across nearly 16,000 acres, and is home to a student body of approximately 4,400 cadets.
The  total  contract  award  includes  estimated  revenues  of  approximately  $519  million  over  a  50-year  period,  subject  to  an  annual  economic  price
adjustment.

On December 12, 2019, as part of a strategic review undertaken by the Company, the Company sold all of its interest in its Keystone operations to a natural
gas and oil industry investment group, for total cash consideration of $31 million, subject to adjustment based on post-closing working capital. As a result of the
sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $44 million, or $35 million after-tax, during the fourth quarter of 2019, as discussed above. See  Note 4—
Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Future Growth

Looking forward, the Company expects to invest between $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion from 2020 to 2024, and between $20 billion to $22 billion from 2020

to 2029, including a range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in 2020. The Company’s expected future investments include:

•

•

capital investment for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses of $8.2 billion over the next five years, and between $18.2 billion and
$19.2 billion over the next 10 years, including $1.6 billion expected in 2020; and

growth from acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to expand the Company’s water and wastewater customer base of between $600 million to $1.2
billion over  the  next  five  years,  and  between  $2 billion to  $3 billion over  the  next  10  years,  including  a  range  of  $100 million to  $300 million
expected in 2020.

Table of Contents

Presented in the following chart is the estimated allocation of the Company’s expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in its Regulated

Businesses over the next five years, by purpose:

Operational Excellence

The  Company  continues  to  strive  for  industry-leading  operational  efficiency,  driven  largely  by  technology.  The  Company’s  technology  investments  are

aimed at enhancing its customer experience and operational efficiency.

•

In 2019:

•

•

•

•

the Regulated Businesses achieved an adjusted O&M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP measure) of 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared to 35.6% and 35.3% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The improvement in the Company’s adjusted
O&M efficiency ratio in 2019, when compared to 2018, was due to an increase in operating revenues as well as continued focus on operating
costs of the Regulated Businesses;

the Company worked to decrease costs and deploy capital efficiently, including using trenchless technologies for pipeline rehabilitation and
leveraging its buying power and strategic sourcing to drive cost savings;

the  Company  continued  its  commitment  to  water  quality  and  the  environment  by  leveraging  new  technologies;  the  Company  now  has
advanced water quality sensors at all of its major drinking water intake sites and is automating its environmental reporting and compliance
systems; and

the  Company  implemented  other  technology  tools  that  will  enhance  communication,  collaboration  and  mobility,  enable  further  business
insights  and  process  automation,  and  increase  self-service  capabilities,  to  help  its  employees  work  safely  and  efficiently,  and  enhance  the
customer experience.

•

Looking forward, the Company will focus on technology and efficiency to:

•

•

be the leader in optimizing technology across the water and wastewater industry, with a focus on specific, innovative projects that will set it
apart from other utilities; aiding the Company in serving its customers with greater ease, making the Company’s employees safer and helping
the Company operate more efficiently; and

further improve the Company’s adjusted O&M efficiency ratio.

48

Table of Contents

The Company’s adjusted O&M efficiency  ratio  is defined  as its operation  and maintenance  expenses from the Regulated Businesses, divided by the pro
forma  operating  revenues  from  the  Regulated Businesses,  where  both  operation  and  maintenance  expenses  and  pro  forma  operating  revenues  were  adjusted  to
eliminate purchased water expense. Also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses are the allocable portion of non-operation and maintenance support
services  costs, mainly depreciation  and general  taxes, which are reflected  in the Regulated Businesses segment as operation  and maintenance  expenses, but for
consolidated financial reporting purposes, are categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In addition to the adjustments discussed above, for period-to-period comparability purposes, the estimated impact of the TCJA on operating revenues for
the Regulated Businesses has been presented on a pro forma basis for all periods prior to January 1, 2018, as if the lower federal corporate income tax rate was in
effect for these periods. The Company also made the following adjustments to the O&M efficiency ratio: (i) excluded from operation and maintenance expenses is
the impact of certain Freedom Industries chemical spill settlement activities recognized in 2017, 2018 and 2019 (see Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in
the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional  information);  and  (ii)  excluded  from  operation  and  maintenance  expenses  is  the  impact  of  the
Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-
Retirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”), for 2017, 2018 and 2019. The items discussed above were excluded from the calculation as they are not reflective of
management’s ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses.

The Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors, because it directly measures improvement in the
efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This information  is derived from the Company’s consolidated  financial information  but is not presented  in its financial
statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  This  information  is  intended  to  enhance  an  investor’s  overall  understanding  of  the  Company’s  operating
performance. The Company’s adjusted O&M efficiency ratio is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP, may not be comparable to other companies’
operating measures and should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Presented  in  the  table  below  is  the  calculation  of  the  Company’s  adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  and  a  reconciliation  that  compares  operation  and

The Company’s Indiana subsidiary received an order approving a joint settlement agreement with all major parties with respect to its general rate case filing, authorizing annualized
incremental revenues of $4 million in the first rate year, effective July 1, 2019, and $13 million in the second rate year, effective approximately May 1, 2020.

The Company’s California subsidiary received approval for the second rate year (2019) step increase associated with its most recent general rate case authorization, effective May 11,
2019.  On  December  13,  2018,  a  settlement  in  this  subsidiary’s  general  rate  case  filing  was  approved,  authorizing  rates  effective  January  1,  2018.  In  2017,  step  rates  were  effective
January 13 through February 2.

The Company’s New York subsidiary implemented its third step increase associated with its most recent general rate case authorization, effective April 1, 2019.

The effective date was June 15, 2018. As part of the resolution of the general rate case, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary’s customers received refunds for the amount of provisional
rates implemented as of June 15, 2018 and collected, to the extent that such rates exceeded the final rate increase plus interest.

(e)

The effective date was May 24, 2017, authorizing the implementation of interim rates as of April 1, 2016.

Pending General Rate Case Filings

There is no assurance that all or any portion of the following requests will be granted.

On December 16, 2019, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $88 million annualized incremental revenues.

On November 12, 2019, the Company’s California  subsidiary filed  for the third year (2020) step increase requesting  $5 million associated  with its most
recent  general  case  authorization.  Step  rates  became  effective  on  January  1,  2020,  subject  to  refund.  As  of  February  14,  2020,  five  of  the  seven  districts’  step
increases were approved representing $4 million of the $5 million request.

On July  1,  2019,  the  Company’s  California  subsidiary  filed  a  general  rate  case  requesting  $26 million annualized  incremental  revenues  for  2021,  and
increases of $10 million and $11 million in the escalation year of 2022 and the attrition year of 2023, respectively. On January 22, 2020, the Company’s California
subsidiary submitted a request to delay by one year its cost of capital filing and maintain its current authorized cost of capital through 2021. If the extension is not
granted, the subsidiary may file the cost of capital application by May 1, 2020 to adjust its authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2021.

In 2018, the Company’s Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $5 million in annualized incremental revenues. On May 1, 2019, interim

rates under bond and subject to refund were implemented and will remain in effect until a final decision is received in this general rate case.

Tax Matters

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December  22,  2017,  the  TCJA  was  signed  into  law,  which,  among  other  things,  enacted  significant  and  complex  changes  to  the  Code,  including  a
reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to  21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility
industry, including continuation of interest expense deductibility, the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income taxes.
In 2018, the Company’s 14 regulatory jurisdictions began to seek to address the impacts of the TCJA. The Company has adjusted customer rates to reflect the
lower income tax rate in 11 states. In one of those 11 states, a portion of the tax savings is being used to reduce certain regulatory assets. In one additional state, the
Company  is  using  the  tax  savings  to  offset  additional  capital  investment  and  to  reduce  a  regulatory  asset.  Proceedings  in  the  other  two  regulatory  jurisdictions
remain pending.

52

Table of Contents

The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of the Company’s deferred income taxes that materially impacted its 2017 results of operations and
financial  position.  The  portion  of  this  re-measurement  related  to  the  Regulated  Businesses  was  substantially  offset  by  a  regulatory  liability,  as  the  Company
believes it is probable that the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) created by the TCJA will be used to benefit its regulated customers in future
rates.  Six of  the  Company’s  regulated  subsidiaries  are  amortizing  EADIT  and  crediting  customers,  including  one which  is  using  the  EADIT  to  offset  future
infrastructure investments. The Company expects the timing of the amortization of EADIT credits by the eight remaining regulated subsidiaries to be addressed in
pending or future rate cases or other proceedings.

On March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (the “CAA”) was signed into law. The CAA corrects and clarifies some aspects of the
TCJA related to bonus depreciation eligibility. Specifically, property that was either acquired, or as to which construction began prior to September 27, 2017, is
eligible for bonus depreciation. The Company had a federal NOL carryover balance as of December 31, 2019 that is not expected to be fully utilized until 2020,
which is when the Company expects that it will become a cash taxpayer for federal income tax purposes.

Legislative Updates

In  Illinois,  the  Governor  signed  a  10-year  extension  of  the  Water  Systems  Viability  Act,  Illinois’  fair  market  value  legislation,  in  2018,  which  became
effective in 2019. In addition to extending the act, the updated law removes the previous restriction on the size of water or wastewater systems that can be acquired
and allows all municipalities to take advantage of the benefits of the program.

During 2019, the Company’s regulatory jurisdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of December 31, 2019:

•

•

•

•

•

Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 472 allows non-municipal utilities to benefit from full appraisal recovery of their assets in a sale.

Indiana House Enrolled Act 1406 established the first state appropriation for water infrastructure investment at $20 million per year.

Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 4 extends leveling legislation to require biannual water loss audits and establishes the state revolving fund administrator
as the central coordinator for water issues in the state.

In  Pennsylvania,  House  Bill  751,  now  Act  53  of  2019,  allows  water  and  wastewater  utilities  responsible  for  funding  the  income  taxes  on  taxable
contributions and advances to record the income taxes paid in accumulated deferred income taxes for accounting and ratemaking purposes.

In West Virginia, House Bill 117 allows qualified low income customers to apply for a 20% discount on their wastewater bill.

The main factors contributing to the $54 million increase  in net income attributable  to common shareholders for the year ended  December 31, 2019 are

described in “Segment Results of Operations” below.

Segment Results of Operations

The  Company’s  operating  segments  are  comprised  of  the  revenue-generating  components  of  its  business  for  which  separate  financial  information  is
internally produced and regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business
primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Company also operates market-based businesses that, individually, do not meet
the  criteria  of  a  reportable  segment  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  and  are  collectively  presented  as  the  Market-Based Businesses,  which  is  consistent  with  how
management assesses the results of these businesses.

•

•

•

$20 million increase from water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems; partially offset by a

$24 million decrease from lower water services demand, including $10 million primarily driven by unusually wet weather conditions experienced in
the Northeast and Midwest during the second quarter of 2019 and ongoing customer usage reductions from conservation, partially offset by balancing
accounts, primarily in the Company’s California subsidiary; and a

$17 million decrease from the impacts of the TCJA, including the Company’s Missouri subsidiary’s 2018 general rate case decision which authorized
the adjustment of customer rates, effective May 28, 2018, to reflect the income tax savings resulting from the TCJA.

In 2019,  employee-related  costs  increased $11 million primarily  due  to  a  $17  million  increase  in  salaries  and  wages  and  group  insurance  from  higher
headcount and related compensation expense supporting growth in the businesses, as well as the union-represented employees’ first full year participation in the
Company’s cash-based annual performance plan during 2019; partially offset by a $7 million decrease in pension expense primarily due to lower service costs.

56

Table of Contents

Operating Supplies and Services

In 2019, operating supplies and services increased $10 million primarily due to higher costs for technology services, including higher software licensing

costs and technical support, and expenses related to various projects in the Company’s California subsidiary, as well as an increase in other operating expenses.

Maintenance Materials and Supplies

In 2019, maintenance materials and supplies decreased $7 million primarily due to higher volume of main breaks and paving costs, driven by the colder

weather experienced during the first quarter of 2018.

Customer Billing and Accounting

In 2019, customer billing and accounting decreased $5 million from a decrease in customer uncollectible expense.

Other (Operation and Maintenance)

In 2019, other (operation and maintenance) increased $10 million primarily due to a $20 million benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2018, resulting
from an insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia, offset in part by (i) a $4 million reduction to the liability related to
the Freedom Industries chemical spill, recorded in the first quarter of 2019, and (ii) an increase in operating revenues and O&M expense during 2018 resulting
from the authorization for the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary to use a portion of the income tax savings resulting from the TCJA for accelerated recovery of
certain regulatory assets.

Depreciation and Amortization

In 2019, depreciation and amortization increased $29 million primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service from investments.

Other Income (Expenses)

In 2019, other income (expenses) decreased $15 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense from the issuance of incremental long-term debt in
the second quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2018 to support growth of the business, partially offset by interest savings from early debt redemptions and tax-
exempt bond refinancings during 2019.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate.

Operating Revenues

In 2019, operating revenues increased $63 million primarily due to a:

•

•

•

•

$74 million increase in HOS from contract growth and from the acquisition of Pivotal, which occurred in the second quarter of 2018; and a

$20 million increase in MSG from the addition of two new contracts in 2018 (Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Fort Leonard Wood); partially
offset by a

$18 million decrease in CSG from the sale of the majority of its O&M contracts in the third quarter of 2018; and a

$15 million decrease at Keystone from the exit of the construction business in the third quarter of 2018.

In 2019, operation and maintenance expense increased $31 million primarily due to a:

•

•

•

$40 million increase in maintenance materials and supplies primarily due to contract growth and increased claims expense in HOS; and a

$5 million increase in employee-related costs primarily in HOS and MSG due to growth in the business, partially offset by lower costs resulting from
the sale of the majority of CSG’s O&M contracts and the exit of the construction business at Keystone, both occurring during the third quarter of
2018; partially offset by a

$14 million decrease in operating supplies and services primarily due to the exit of the construction business in the third quarter of 2018 at Keystone,
higher advertising and marketing expense in HOS in 2018, and lower expenses due to the sale of the majority of  CSG’s O&M contracts during the
third quarter of 2018, as discussed above.

Depreciation and Amortization

In 2019, depreciation and amortization increased $8 million primarily due to the acquisition of Pivotal in the second quarter of 2018.

Loss (Gain) on Asset Dispositions and Purchases

During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss on sale of $44 million, or $35 million after-tax, relating to the sale of its Keystone
operations. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, during the third
quarter of 2018, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $14 million on the sale of the majority of CSG’s O&M contracts.

Impairment Charge

During the third quarter of 2018, a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $57 million was recorded for Keystone, the result of operational and
financial challenges encountered in the construction business, and the Company’s determination to narrow the scope of the Keystone operations to focus on its core
operations  of  providing  water  transfer  services.  See  Note  8—Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for
additional information.

58

Table of Contents

Provision for Income Taxes

In 2019, provision for income taxes increased $9 million primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The  Company  regularly  evaluates  and  monitors  its  cash  requirements  for  capital  investments,  acquisitions,  operations,  commitments,  debt  maturities,
interest and dividends. The Company’s business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. When necessary, the
Company also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. The Company may also
access the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements, as needed. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends
on its credit ratings and current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equity
capital markets, and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the
terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the
capital markets.

If  these  business,  market,  financial  and  other  conditions  deteriorate  to  the  extent  that  the  Company  is  no  longer  able  to  access  the  capital  markets  on
reasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2024 with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion. The
facility is used principally to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs by supporting AWCC’s $2.10 billion commercial paper program and to provide a sublimit of up
to $150 million for letters of credit. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the
facility by up to $500 million.

In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. As of  December 31, 2019,
AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with  $2.25 billion available to fulfill its
short-term liquidity needs, to issue letters of credit, and to provide support for $786 million in outstanding commercial paper. The Company believes that its ability
to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’s short-
term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit
markets. However, there can no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC
will be able to access the commercial  paper or loan markets  in the future  on acceptable  terms or at all. See “Credit  Facilities  and Short-Term  Debt” below for
additional information.

In addition, the Regulated Businesses receive  advances  and contributions  from customers,  home builders  and real  estate  developers  to fund construction
necessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are refundable for limited periods, which vary according to state regulations, as new customers
begin  to  receive  service  or  other  contractual  obligations  are  fulfilled.  Amounts  which  are  no  longer  refundable  are  reclassified  to  contributions  in  aid  of
construction.

The Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities,
(iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) the Company estimates, during 2020, to begin to pay
federal income taxes. The Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment.
Additionally, the Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery
generally  takes  place  over  an  extended  period  of  time,  and  certain  capital  recovery  is  also  subject  to  regulatory  lag.  See  Item  1—Business—Regulated
Businesses—Regulation and Rate Making for additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of
external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than
its cash flows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for
the  next  five  years  through  a  combination  of  long-term  debt  and  equity.  If  necessary,  the  Company  may  delay  certain  capital  investments  or  other  funding
requirements, or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet
its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.

With the enactment of the TCJA and the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company anticipates a decrease in
future  revenue  authorizations  associated  with  the  Regulated Businesses,  initially  leading  to  lower  cash  flows.  The  Company  expects  this  cash  flow  impact  to
decline  over  time,  as  the  Regulated Businesses’  rate  base  grows,  the  result  of  lower  deferred  income  tax  liabilities,  which  offset  rate  base.  The  lower  deferred
income  tax  liabilities  are  mainly  due  to  (i)  a  lower  U.S.  federal  corporate  income  tax  rate,  (ii)  the  normalization  (refunding  to  customers)  of  the  re-measured
deferred income tax liabilities  over the remaining life of the associated assets, and (iii) the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects that
began after September 27, 2017.

One  component  of  WIFIA  is  a  federal  credit  program  administered  by  the  EPA  for  eligible  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure  projects.  The  WIFIA
program  accelerates  investment  in  the  U.S.’s  water  infrastructure  by  providing  long-term,  low-cost  supplemental  loans  for  regionally  and  nationally  significant
projects. The Company is currently pursuing WIFIA financing of approximately $80 million for a project in the Company’s Missouri subsidiary.

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities

Cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities  primarily  result  from  the  sale  of  water  and  wastewater  services  and,  due  to  the  seasonality  of  demand,  are
generally greater during the warmer months. The Company’s future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by, among other things: economic
utility regulation inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; maintenance costs; customer growth; declining customer
usage of water; employee-related costs, including pension funding; weather and seasonality; taxes; and overall economic conditions.

The enactment of the TCJA is accretive to the Company’s consolidated earnings over time through (i) growth in rate base for the same level of expected
capital expenditures due to the impact of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the re-measurement of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities,
(ii) increased earnings in the Market-Based Businesses due to the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, all partially offset by (iii) the lower tax shield on
interest expense at parent company, as well as increased debt levels from lower cash flows from operations as the Company passes the lower tax rate benefits to its
regulated  customers.  The  Company  believes  that  it  will  likely  begin  paying  federal  income  taxes  during  2020,  when  the  Company  expects  its  federal  NOL
carryforwards balance will be fully used, although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in its future results of operations and the outcome of
regulatory proceedings regarding the TCJA.

Cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of funding, sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund the majority
of the Company’s capital investments. The Company expects to seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of its capital investment, if any,
and fund its dividend payments, as needed. Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the Company’s rate regulated environments, changes in
the Market-Based Businesses, changes in the economy, interest rates, the timing of tax payments, and the Company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in a
timely  manner,  among  other  items.  The  Company  can  provide  no  assurance  that  its  customers’  historical  payment  pattern  will  continue  in  the  future.  The
Company’s  current  liabilities  may  exceed  current  assets  mainly  from  debt  maturities  due  within  one  year  and  the  periodic  use  of  short-term  debt  as  a  funding
source,  primarily  to  meet  scheduled  maturities  of  long-term  debt,  fund  acquisitions  and  construction  projects,  as  well  as  cash  needs  which  can  fluctuate
significantly due to the seasonality of the business. The Company addresses cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms.

Table of Contents

In 2019, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $3 million, primarily due to the settlement of cash flow hedges and increased interest costs in
connection  with  the  Company’s  $1.10  billion  debt  offering  that  closed  on  May  13,  2019  and  an  increase  in  pension  contributions.  Partially  offsetting  these
decreases was an increase in net income. The main factors contributing to the increase in net income are described in “Consolidated Results of Operations” and
“Segment Results of Operations” above.

The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $38 million in 2020. In addition, the Company estimates that contributions will
amount to $33 million, $34 million, $34 million and $32 million in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change materially
from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.

In 2019, cash flows used in investing activities decreased $91 million primarily due to the acquisition of Pivotal for $365 million on June 4, 2018, partially
offset by an increase in capital expenditures, principally from incremental investments associated with the replacement and renewal of the Company’s transmission
and distribution infrastructure in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below. The Company also had an increase of proceeds from sale of assets due to the sale
of Keystone for $31 million, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The Company’s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces infrastructure, as needed, and
major capital investment projects, where the Company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and
water quality regulations. The Company’s projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in
economic conditions and other factors.

In 2019, the Company’s capital expenditures increased $68 million primarily due to investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure.

The  Company  also  grows  its  business  primarily  through  acquisitions  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  as  well  as  other  water-related  services.  These
acquisitions are complementary to the Company’s existing business and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations. Generally,
acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with the proceeds from long-term debt, once reflected in rate base.

Table of Contents

The following is a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting the Company’s cash flows from investing activities during 2019:

•

•

Paid $235 million for 21 water and wastewater systems, representing in the aggregate approximately 53,100 customers.

Received $48 million for the sale of assets, including $31 million from the sale of the Keystone operations.

As previously noted, the Company expects to invest between $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion from 2020 to 2024, with $8.2 billion of this range for infrastructure
improvements in the Regulated Businesses, and between $20 billion to $22 billion from 2020 to 2029. In 2020, the Company expects to invest between a range of
$1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in 2020, with $1.6 billion for infrastructure improvements in the  Regulated Businesses. Also in 2020, the Company expects to invest
between $100 million to $300 million for acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses.

Includes  proceeds  from  issuances  of  common  stock  under  various  employee  stock  plans  and  the  dividend  reinvestment  plan,  net  of  taxes  paid,  advances  and  contributions  for
construction, net of refunds, and debt issuance costs and make-whole premiums on early debt redemption.

In 2019, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $232 million, primarily due to the issuance of common stock in 2018, the proceeds of which
were used to finance a portion of the 2018 acquisition of Pivotal, as well as an increase in cash used for dividend payments in 2019. AWCC issued $1.10 billion of
long-term debt as part of its May 13, 2019 debt offering, of which $51 million of the net proceeds was used to repay long-term debt obligations at maturity. Net
proceeds from the debt offering were also used to repay pre-existing short-term borrowings, which resulted in a net cash outflow for 2019 of $178 million.

The  Company’s  financing  activities,  primarily  focused  on  funding  regulated  infrastructure  expenditures,  regulated  and  market-based  acquisitions  and
payment of dividends. These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC and in 2018, included an equity issuance
for approximately 50% of the Pivotal acquisition. In addition, new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction,
net of refunds, which amounted to $26 million, $21 million and $28 million for the years ended  December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Based on the
needs of the Regulated Businesses and the  Company, AWCC may  borrow funds  or issue  its  debt in  the capital  markets  and then,  through intercompany  loans,
provide those borrowings to the Regulated Businesses and parent company. The Regulated Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the
respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. Parent company’s borrowings are not a
source  of  capital  for  the  Regulated Businesses,  therefore,  parent  company  is  not  able  to  recover  the  interest  charges  on  its  debt  through  regulated  water  and
wastewater rates. As of December 31, 2019, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the Regulated Businesses amounting to
$4.8 billion and  $675 million, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to
parent  company  amounting  $2.4 billion and  $111 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2019,  parent  company  has  made  long-term  fixed  rate  loans  to  the
Market-Based Businesses amounting to $183 million related to the acquisition of Pivotal on June 4, 2018.

On May 13, 2019, AWCC completed a $1.10 billion senior unsecured debt offering which included the sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of
its 3.45% Senior Notes due 2029 and $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.15% Senior Notes due 2049. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received,
after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1.09 billion. AWCC used the net proceeds to:
(i) lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) repay $25 million principal amount of AWCC’s  7.21% Series I Senior Notes at maturity on
May  19,  2019;  (iii)  repay  $26 million aggregate  principal  amount  of  subsidiary  debt  at  maturity  during  the  second  quarter  of  2019;  and  (iv)  repay  AWCC’s
commercial paper obligations, and for general corporate purposes.

On May 6, 2019, the Company terminated five forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  $510 million, realizing a net loss
of $30 million,  to  be  amortized  through  interest,  net  over  10 and  30 year  periods,  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  new  debt  issued  on  May  13,  2019.  No
ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

During 2019, AWCC and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also issued tax-exempt bonds at various dates with a total principal amount of $417 million
and  a  weighted  average  interest  rate  of  2.5%.  The  bonds  are  scheduled  to  mature  in  2039  and  contain  optional  or  mandatory  redemption  dates  in  2029.  The
proceeds from these bonds were used to repay $417 million of tax-exempt bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 5.8% and original maturities in 2039.

One of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk
management  policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managing
commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The
derivative  contracts  entered  into  are  for  periods  consistent  with  the  related  underlying  exposures.  The  Company  is  exposed  to  the  risk  that  counterparties  to
derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by only dealing with
leading, credit-worthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.

In May 2018, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital needs
through  the  offer  and  sale  to  the  public  from  time  to  time  of  an  unlimited  amount  of  various  types  of  securities,  including  American  Water  common  stock,
preferred stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and
as applicable, rating status. The shelf registration statement will expire in May 2021. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, $1.10 billion, $1.33 billion, and $1.35 billion,
respectively, of debt securities were issued pursuant to this and the Company’s predecessor registration statement. Additionally, during 2018 under this registration
statement, the Company issued 2.32 million shares of its common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $183 million.

From  time  to  time  and  as  market  conditions  warrant,  the  Company  may  engage  in  long-term  debt  retirements  through  tender  offers,  open  market

repurchases or other viable alternatives.

In February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued through the
Company’s dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the Company to purchase up to 10 million
shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The
program  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  Rule  10b-18  of  the  Exchange  Act,  and,  to  facilitate  these  repurchases,  the  Company  enters  into  Rule  10b5-1  stock
repurchase plans with a third-party broker, which allow the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from
doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations, the Company may, at its discretion, elect
to enter into repurchase transactions or to amend or cancel the program or the stock repurchase parameters, all to manage dilution from the issuance of shares as
described above. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has repurchased an aggregate of 4,860,000 shares of common stock under this program.

Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt

AWCC has an unsecured revolving credit facility of $2.25 billion that expires in March 2024. In April 2019, AWCC and its lenders agreed to extend the
termination  date  of  the  credit  agreement  with  respect  to  AWCC’s  revolving  credit  facility  pursuant  to  its  terms  from  March  2023  to  March  2024.  Subject  to
satisfying  certain  conditions,  the  credit  agreement  also  permits  AWCC to increase  the  maximum  commitment  under  the  facility  by up to  an  aggregate  of  $500
million, and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two, one-year periods, as to which one such extension request remains.

Interest  rates  on  advances  under  the  facility  are  based  on  a  credit  spread  to  the  LIBOR  rate  (or  applicable  market  replacement  rate)  or  base  rate  in
accordance  with  Moody  Investors  Service’s  and  Standard  &  Poor’s  Financial  Services’  then  applicable  credit  rating  on  AWCC’s  senior  unsecured,  non-credit
enhanced debt. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credit. Indebtedness
under  the  facility  is  considered  “debt”  for  purposes  of  a  support  agreement  between  parent  company  and  AWCC,  which  serves  as  a  functional  equivalent  of  a
guarantee by parent company of AWCC’s payment obligations under the credit facility.

In March 2018, AWCC increased the maximum aggregate outstanding amount under its commercial paper program from $1.60 billion to $2.10 billion.

The changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in long-term debt.

Debt Covenants

The Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants,
an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company or its subsidiaries may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue new
debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company
from  issuing  debt  secured  by  the  Company’s  assets,  subject  to  certain  exceptions.  Failure  to  comply  with  any  of  these  covenants  could  accelerate  repayment
obligations.

Covenants  in  certain  long-term  notes  and  the  revolving  credit  facility  require  the  Company  to  maintain  a  ratio  of  consolidated  debt  to  consolidated
capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2019, the Company’s ratio was 0.61 to 1.00 and therefore the
Company was in compliance with the covenants.

Security Ratings

Presented  in  the  table  below  are  long-term  and  short-term  credit  ratings  and  rating  outlooks  as  of  February  18,  2020 as  issued  by  the  following  rating

agencies:

Rating Outlook

Senior unsecured debt

Commercial paper

Securities

Moody’s Investors
Service
Stable

Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Service
Stable

Baa1

P-2

A

A-1

On June 7, 2019, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service affirmed the Company’s long-term ‘A’ and short-term ‘A-1’ credit ratings, with a stable outlook.

On April 1, 2019, Moody’s Investors Service changed the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1, from A3, with a stable outlook. The Company’s

commercial paper rating remained unchanged.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an
amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain
its existing ratings. None of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such
a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.

65

Table of Contents

As  part  of  its  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  routinely  enters  into  contracts  for  the  purchase  and  sale  of  water,  energy,  chemicals  and  other
services.  These  contracts  either  contain  express  provisions  or  otherwise  permit  the  Company  and  its  counterparties  to  demand  adequate  assurance  of  future
performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a
credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade
as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure its
obligations.  The  Company  does  not  expect  to  post  any  collateral  which  will  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’s  results  of  operations,  financial
position or cash flows.

Access  to  the  capital  markets,  including  the  commercial  paper  market,  and  respective  financing  costs  in  those  markets,  may  be  directly  affected  by  the
Company’s securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, the
Company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower
the overall cost of debt.

Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions

For  discussion  of  the  Company’s  dividends,  dividend  restrictions  and  dividend  policy,  see  Note  9—Shareholders’  Equity in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated

Financial Statements for additional information.

Insurance Coverage

The Company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent
with  industry  standards.  However,  insurance  coverage  may  not  be  adequate  or  available  to  cover  unanticipated  losses  or  claims.  Additionally,  annual  policy
renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-insured to
the  extent  that  losses  are  within  the  policy  deductible  or  exceed  the  amount  of  insurance  maintained.  Such  losses  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the
Company’s short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.

Performance Obligations

The Company has entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities  and other
customers. These obligations are not included in the table above. For discussion of the Company’s performance obligations see Note 3—Revenue Recognition in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions and
judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions
and judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates
and  assumptions  in  matters  that  are  inherently  uncertain  and  that  may  change  in  subsequent  periods.  Accordingly,  changes  in  the  estimates,  assumptions  and
judgments  applied  to  these  accounting  policies  could  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows,  as
reflected  in  the  Company’s  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Management  has  reviewed  the  critical  accounting  polices  described  below  with  the  Company’s
Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion regarding these critical
accounting policies and their application can be found in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation and Regulatory Accounting

The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for
rate  regulated  utilities,  which  requires  the  Company  to  reflect  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  in  its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Use  of  this  authoritative
guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption
that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of  December 31, 2019, the Company
concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria.

Application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking
process. The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, but
are not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and other
differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated
entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of a
regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are
refundable to customers.

For each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory
assets  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  recovery  and  regulatory  liabilities  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  This
assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific
or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events indicate that
the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Operations and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no
longer meets the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the
elimination  of  any  or  all  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  that  had  been  recorded  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Failure  to  meet  the  criteria  of  this
authoritative guidance could materially impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

On December  22,  2017,  the  TCJA  was  signed  into  law,  which,  among  other  things,  enacted  significant  and  complex  changes  to  the  Code,  including  a
reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significant excess deferred income
taxes  that  the  Company  and  its  regulatory  jurisdictions  believe  should  be  refunded  to  customers.  As  such,  the  Company  recorded  these  amounts  as  regulatory
liabilities.

As  of  December  31,  2019 and  2018,  the  Company’s  regulatory  asset  balance  was  $1.1 billion and  $1.2 billion,  respectively,  and  its  regulatory  liability
balance was $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information regarding the Company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue  from  the  Company’s  Regulated  Businesses  is  generated  primarily  from  water  and  wastewater  services  delivered  to  customers.  These  contracts
contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately
identifiable  from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  are
generally  no significant  financing  components  or  variable  consideration.  Revenues include  amounts  billed  to  customers  on a  cycle  basis,  and unbilled  amounts
calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts
that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value
transferred to the customer.

Increases  or  decreases  in  the  volumes  delivered  to  customers  and  rate  mix  due  to  changes  in  usage  patterns  in  customer  classes  in  the  period  could  be
significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for
each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31,
2019 and 2018 was $142 million and $144 million, respectively.

The  Company  also  recognizes  revenue  when  it  is  probable  that  future  recovery  of  previously  incurred  costs  or  future  refunds  that  are  to  be  credited  to

customers will occur through the ratemaking process.

Revenue  from  the  Company’s  Homeowner  Services  Group is  generated  through  various  protection  programs  in  which  the  Company  provides  fixed  fee
services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and external water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and
cooling  systems,  water  heaters,  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  Most  of  the  contracts  have  a  one-year  term  and  each  service  is  a  separate
performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service. Customers are obligated
to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services. Advances
from customers are deferred until the performance obligation is satisfied.

The Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military
installations and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers, and prior to the sale of Keystone, the Company had shorter-term contracts that provided
customized water transfer services for shale natural gas companies and customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over
the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company
to  make  capital  improvements  to  underlying  infrastructure,  which  are  initiated  through  separate  modifications  or  amendments  to  the  original  contract,  whereby
stand-alone,  fixed  pricing  is  separately  stated  for  each  improvement.  The  Company  has  determined  that  these  capital  improvements  are  separate  performance
obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the
period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded
as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance
and  related  estimated  contract  profitability  may  result  in  revisions  to  costs  and  revenues,  and  are  recognized  in  the  period  in  which  revisions  are  determined.
Unbilled revenue for the Market-Based Businesses as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $30 million and $42 million, respectively.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken,

as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.

In accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a
two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater
than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical
merits,  no  benefit  is  recorded.  Uncertain  tax  positions  that  relate  only  to  timing  of  when  an  item  is  included  on  a  tax  return  are  considered  to  have  met  the
recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position
will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition
threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability
to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in
the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferred
tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.

Table of Contents

Under  GAAP,  specifically  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  740,  Income  Taxes  (“ASC  740”),  the  tax  effects  of  changes  in  tax  laws  must  be
recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to
apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment of the TCJA, the Company’s deferred taxes were re-measured based
upon the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may
be subject to refund to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment
to earnings.

Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Company’s
forecasted  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations,  failure  to  successfully  implement  tax  planning  strategies  and  recovery  of  taxes  through  the  regulatory
process  for  the  Regulated Businesses,  as  well  as  results  of  audits  and  examinations  of  filed  tax  returns  by  taxing  authorities.  The  resulting  tax  balances  as  of
December  31,  2019 and  2018 are  appropriately  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  authoritative  guidance;  however,  the  ultimate  outcome  of  tax
matters  could  result  in  favorable  or  unfavorable  adjustments  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  such  adjustments  could  be  material.  See  Note 14—
Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.

Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations.
See Note 15—Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the
defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.

The Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided
by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension and
postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected to
represent  the  average  expected  experience  over  time  and  may  differ  in  any  one  year  from  actual  experience  due  to  changes  in  capital  markets  and  the  overall
economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptions
are:

•

•

•

•

•

Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made
in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of
high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.

Expected  Return  on  Plan  Assets  (“EROA”)—Management  projects  the  future  return  on  plan  assets  considering  prior  performance,  but  primarily
based upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit
costs the Company records currently.

Rate  of  Compensation  Increase—Management  projects  employees’  pay  increases,  which  are  used  to  project  employees’  pension  benefits  at
retirement.

Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.

Mortality—Management retained the Society of Actuaries RP-2014 mortality base table, which provides rates of mortality in 2006, but adopted the
new MP-2018 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2006.

The discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent
with  changes  in  applicable  high-quality,  long-term  corporate  bond  indices.  The  Company  uses  an  approach  that  approximates  the  process  of  settlement  of
obligations  tailored  to  the  plans’  expected  cash  flows  by  matching  the  plans’  cash  flows  to  the  coupons  and  expected  maturity  values  of  individually  selected
bonds. For  each  plan,  the discount  rate  was developed  as  the level  equivalent  rate  that  would  yield  the  same  present  value  as  using spot  rates  aligned  with the
projected benefit payments. The discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 3.44%, 4.38% and 3.75% at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively.  The  discount  rate  for  determining  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  was  3.36%, 4.32% and  3.73% at  December  31,  2019, 2018 and  2017,
respectively.

In selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans.
The  long-term  EROA  assumption  used  in  calculating  pension  cost  was  6.20% for  2019, 5.95% for  2018,  and  6.49% for  2017.  The  weighted  average  EROA
assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 3.56% for 2019, 4.77% for 2018 and 5.09% for 2017.

Postretirement Medical Bargaining Plan Changes

On July 31, 2018, a new, five-year national benefits agreement was ratified, covering approximately 3,200 of the Company’s union-represented employees.
Most of the benefits under this new agreement became effective on January 1, 2019, and include, among other things, union-represented employees’ participation
in  the  Company’s  cash-based  annual  performance  plan,  additional  medical  plan  options  and  changes  to  certain  retiree  medical  benefits,  which  required  the
Company to remeasure its other postretirement benefit plan obligation during the third quarter of 2018.

For those eligible union retirees and dependents over age 65, the current supplemental retiree medical plan will be replaced with a Health Reimbursement
Arrangement (“HRA”) similar to the cap currently in place for non-union retirees. The Company is providing a subsidy allowing the post-65 retirees to purchase a
Medicare supplemental plan on a private exchange network. The pre-65 coverage plan was also amended to provide a cap on future employer costs designed to
limit the employer costs to 2018 levels. For pre-65 union members retiring early in 2019-2021 a supplemental benefit will be provided to alleviate the effect of the
cap.

On August  31,  2018,  the  Postretirement  Medical  Benefit  Plan  was  remeasured  to  reflect  this  plan  change.  The  plan  change  resulted  in  a  $175 million
reduction  in  future  benefits  payable  to  plan  participants,  and,  in  combination  with  other  experience  reflected  as  of  the  remeasurement  date,  resulted  in  a  $227
million reduction  to the net accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation.  The plan amendment  will be amortized  over  10.2 years,  the average  future  working
lifetime to full eligibility age for all plan participants.

After the remeasurement, the Retirement and Benefit Plans Investment Committee (the “Investment Committee”), which is responsible for overseeing the
investment of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets, determined that the funded status of the Postretirement Medical Bargaining
Plan was in excess of that needed to pay current and future benefits.

Given the change in funded status in 2018, the Investment Committee commissioned an asset-liability study for the Postretirement Medical Bargaining Plan.
This study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the investment risk in the plan due to its current funded status. The study also recommended  reducing its
exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future  benefit payments of the liability.  The Investment
Committee  approved  the  recommendations.  Plan  assets  in  excess  of  those  securities  designed  to  match  the  long-term  liabilities  are  invested  in  shorter  duration
fixed income securities and equities.

American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-Bargaining Plan, and the American Water Life Insurance Trust.

The  investments  of  the  pension  and  postretirement  welfare  plan  trusts  include  debt  and  equity  securities  held  either  directly  or  through  mutual  funds,
commingled funds and limited partnerships. The trustee for the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation
firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets.

In  selecting  a  rate  of  compensation  increase,  the  Company  considers  past  experience  in  light  of  movements  in  inflation  rates.  The  Company’s  rate  of

compensation increase was 2.97% for 2019, 3.00% for 2018 and 3.02% for 2017.

Table of Contents

In selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2018, the
Company’s health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 6.75% in 2019 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter. As of
December 31, 2019, the Company is projecting that medical inflation will be 6.50% in 2020 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter.

The Company will use a discount rate and EROA of 3.44% and 6.50%, respectively, for estimating its 2020 pension costs. Additionally, the Company will
use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 3.36% and 3.68%, respectively, for estimating its 2020 other postretirement benefit
costs. A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase the Company’s pension expense. The Company’s 2019 and 2018 pension and postretirement
benefit costs were $17 million and $21 million, respectively. The Company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of
$38 million in  2020, and $33 million, $34 million, $34 million and  $32 million in  2021, 2022, 2023 and  2024, respectively.  Actual amounts contributed could
change  significantly  from  these  estimates.  The  assumptions  are  reviewed  annually  and  at  any  interim  re-measurement  of  the  plan  obligations.  The  impact  of
assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable
accounting standards.

Accounting for Contingencies

The Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of
the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the
likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these
judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limited to: the
nature  of  the  litigation,  claim  or  assessment,  review  of  applicable  law,  opinions  or  views  of  legal  counsel  and  other  advisors,  and  the  experience  gained  from
similar cases or situations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an
additional loss may be incurred. The Company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a
single amount or within a reasonable range.

Actual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a
significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. The Company is exposed to risks
from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Company manages its interest rate exposure by
limiting  its  variable  rate  exposure  and  by  monitoring  the  effects  of  market  changes  in  interest  rates.  The  Company  also  has  the  ability  to  enter  into  financial
derivative instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock
agreements  to  manage  and  mitigate  interest  rate  risk  exposure.  As  of  December  31,  2019,  a  hypothetical  increase  of  interest  rates  by  1% associated  with  the
Company’s short-term borrowings would result in a $7 million increase in short-term interest expense.

The Company’s risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the
expected ability to recover price increases through rates, in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism, as authorized by each regulatory
jurisdiction. Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and
cash flows.

The market price of the Company’s common stock may experience fluctuations,  which may be unrelated to its operating performance.  In particular,  the
Company’s stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These
could  include,  among  other  things,  interest  rate  movements,  quarterly  variations  or  changes  in  financial  estimates  by  securities  analysts  and  governmental  or
regulatory actions. This volatility  may make it difficult for the Company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its common
stock or other equity securities, regardless of its financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude the Company from being able to take advantage of certain
business opportunities or meet business obligations.

71

Table of Contents

The Company is exposed to credit risk through its water, wastewater and other water-related services provided by the Regulated Businesses and  Market-
Based Businesses. The Company’s Regulated Businesses serve residential, commercial, industrial and other customers, while the Market-Based Businesses engage
in business activities with developers, government entities and other customers. The Company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual
obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. The Company’s credit risk is managed
through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure
and  the  use  of  credit  risk  mitigation  measures  such  as  letters  of  credit  or  prepayment  arrangements.  The  Company’s  credit  portfolio  is  diversified  with  no
significant  customer  or  industry  concentrations.  In  addition,  the  Regulated  Businesses are  generally  able  to  recover  all  prudently  incurred  costs  including
uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates.

The Company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact
the  Company’s  pension  and  other  benefits  expense,  funded  status  and  future  minimum  funding  requirements.  Changes  in  interest  rates  can  impact  retirement
liabilities. The Company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to
that  of  its  pension  liabilities,  seeking  to  hedge  some  of  the  interest  rate  sensitivity  of  its  liabilities.  That  way,  if  interest  rates  fall  and  liabilities  increase,  the
Company expects that the fixed-income assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value. The Company also expects its risk to be reduced through its ability
to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates.

The Company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates.
The credit quality of the Company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable
economic  cycles  and  other  market  changes.  In  addition,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  regulators  will  grant  sufficient  rate  authorizations.  Therefore,  the
Company’s  ability  to  fully  recover  operating  expense,  recover  its  investment  and  provide  an  appropriate  return  on  invested  capital  made  in  the  Regulated
Businesses may be adversely impacted.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
American Water Works Company, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries (the  “Company”)  as  of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We
also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance  about  whether  the consolidated financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

74

Table of Contents

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  that  was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way
our opinion on the consolidated  financial  statements,  taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating  the critical  audit matter  below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation

As described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were $1,128
million and   $1,806  million,  respectively,  as  of  December  31,  2019.  The  Company’s  regulated  utilities  are  subject  to  regulation  by  multiple  state  utility
commissions and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be
reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business,
management assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory
liabilities  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  This  assessment  includes  consideration  of  factors  such  as  changes  in  regulatory
environments, recent rate orders, including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdictions,
and the status of any pending or potential legislation.

The  principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  accounting  for  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  is  a  critical  audit
matter are there was significant judgment by management related to the accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, including assessing whether the regulatory
assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement as a result of
changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders, including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in
the  same  jurisdictions,  and  the  status  of  any  pending  or  potential  legislation.  This  in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity,  and  effort  in
performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to management’s judgments.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s regulatory accounting process, including controls
over  management’s  assessment  and  consideration  of  factors  related  to  the  probability  of  future  recovery  or  settlement.  These  procedures  also included, among
others, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the probability of recovery and settlement based on the Company’s correspondence
with  regulators,  status  of  regulatory  proceedings,  past  practices,  recent  rate  orders  on  specific  or  similar  incurred  cost  to  other  regulated  entities  in  the  same
jurisdictions, and other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and disclosure implications; and evaluating regulatory assets and liabilities balances
based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with the Company’s regulators.

American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unless otherwise noted, in millions, except per share data)

Note 1: Organization and Operation

American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “American  Water”)  is  a  holding  company  for  regulated  and  market-based  subsidiaries
throughout  the  United  States.  References  to  “parent  company”  mean  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.,  without  its  subsidiaries.  The  Company’s  primary
business involves the ownership of regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services in 16 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the
“Regulated Businesses.” The Company also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary water and wastewater services within non-reportable
operating  segments,  collectively  referred  to  as  the  “Market-Based  Businesses.”  The  Company’s  primary  Market-Based  Businesses include  the  Homeowner
Services Group, which provides various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers; and the Military Services Group, which
enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations.

Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies

Regulation

The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively
referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which
requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at levels intended to
recover  the  estimated  costs  of  providing  service,  plus  a  return  on  net  investments,  or  rate  base.  Regulators  may  also  approve  accounting  treatments,  long-term
financing  programs  and  cost  of  capital,  operation  and  maintenance  (“O&M”)  expenses,  capital  expenditures,  taxes,  affiliated  transactions  and  relationships,
reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in
the  collection  of  a  regulated  utility’s  revenues,  these  authoritative  accounting  principles  allow  a  cost  that  would  otherwise  be  charged  as  an  expense  by a  non-
regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these principles also require the
creation  of  a  regulatory  liability  for  amounts  collected  in  rates  to  recover  costs  expected  to  be  incurred  in  the  future,  or  amounts  collected  in  excess  of  costs
incurred and are refundable to customers. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for additional information.

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  (“GAAP”)  requires  that
management make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results
could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatory
accounting  principles  and  the  related  determination  and  estimation  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,  (ii)  revenue  recognition  and  the  estimates  used  in  the
calculation  of  unbilled  revenue,  (iii)  accounting  for  income  taxes,  (iv)  benefit  plan  assumptions  and  (v)  the  estimates  and  judgments  used  in  determining  loss
contingencies. The Company’s critical accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets and
liabilities, income taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is

maintained after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement of
retirement units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering and
supervision, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged to
O&M expense as incurred.

The cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Company’s regulated utilities record depreciation in
conformity  with  amounts  approved  by  PUCs, after  regulatory  review  of  the  information  the  Company  submits  to  support  its  estimates  of  the  assets’  remaining
useful lives.

Nonutility  property  consists  primarily  of  buildings  and  equipment  utilized  by  the  Company’s  Market-Based Businesses and for internal operations. This

property is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.

82

Table of Contents

When units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulated
depreciation. To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset
is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These
amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets are
incurred.

The costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of these

costs amounted to $345 million and $336 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds

Substantially  all  cash  is  invested  in  interest-bearing  accounts.  All  highly  liquid  investments  with  a  maturity  of  three  months  or  less  when purchased  are

considered to be cash equivalents.

Restricted funds consist primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future services
under O&M projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.

Presented  in the  table  below  is a  reconciliation  of  the  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  restricted  funds  amounts  as  presented  on the Consolidated  Balance

Sheets to the sum of such amounts presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31:

Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues

Accounts receivable include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally on
a monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based trade
accounts receivable and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has not
been billed to customers and when costs exceed billings on market-based construction contracts.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts

Allowances  for  uncollectible  accounts  are  maintained  for  estimated  probable  losses  resulting  from  the  Company’s  inability  to  collect  receivables  from
customers. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowance
for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due and previous loss history. The Company generally writes off accounts when they
become uncollectible  or reserves accounts that exceed a certain number of days outstanding. See Note 6—Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts for additional
information.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.

Leases

The Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. The Company determines
if  an  arrangement  is  a  lease  at  inception.  Operating  leases  are  included  in  operating  lease  right-of-use  (“ROU”)  assets,  accrued  liabilities  and  operating  lease
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include operating leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.

83

Table of Contents

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are generally recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of discounted lease payments over
the  lease  term.  As  most  of  the  Company’s  leases  do  not  provide  an  implicit  rate,  the  Company  uses  its  incremental  borrowing  rate  based  on  the  information
available  at the commencement  date  in determining  the  present  value of discounted  lease payments.  The implicit  rate is used when readily  determinable.  ROU
assets also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate  the lease
when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The  Company  has  lease  agreements  with  lease  components  (e.g.,  fixed  payments  including  rent,  real  estate  taxes  and  insurance  costs)  and  non-lease
components  (e.g., common-area  maintenance  costs), which are generally  accounted  for separately;  however, the Company accounts for the lease  and non-lease
components  as  a  single  lease  component  for  certain  leases.  Certain  lease  agreements  include  variable  rental  payments  adjusted  periodically  for  inflation.
Additionally, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company’s lease agreements do not
contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a
business. Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested for
impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit below its carrying value.

The Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with (i) the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003, (ii)
the acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to the Company’s previous owner in 2001, and (iii) the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions (“Pivotal”)
in 2018;  and has  been allocated  to reporting  units based  on the  fair  values  at the  date  of  the acquisitions.  For purposes  of testing  goodwill for  impairment,  the
reporting units in the Regulated Businesses segment are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The  Market-Based Businesses is comprised of the  Homeowner
Services Group and Military Services Group reporting units.

The  Company’s  annual  impairment  testing  is  performed  as  of  November 30 of  each  year,  in  conjunction  with  the  completion  of  the  Company’s  annual
business plan. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors,
that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the
qualitative assessment, or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than its
carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based test is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective
net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s
carrying value compared to its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Application of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of
reporting units. Management estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, but
are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates.

The Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the
assumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note
8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of finite-lived customer relationships associated with the acquisition of Pivotal. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially
measured at their estimated fair values, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible
assets are consumed or otherwise used. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.

Table of Contents

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assets
for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When such indicators arise, the Company estimates the fair
value of the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, comparing the estimated
fair  value  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset.  An  impairment  loss  will  be  recognized  in  the  amount  equal  to  the  excess  of  the  long-lived  asset’s  carrying  value
compared to its estimated fair value.

The long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide
operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in
rates of that asset is no longer probable.

The Company holds other long-term investments in privately held companies and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, and are classified as
other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of the long-term investments is dependent on the financial performance and
solvency of the entities in which the Company invests, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets. If such long-term investments are considered impaired,
an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the investment’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.

The  Company  believes  the  assumptions  and  other  considerations  used  to  value  long-lived  assets  to  be  appropriate,  however,  if  actual  experience  differs
from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction

Regulated utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estate

developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas.

Advances are refundable  for limited  periods of time  as new customers  begin to receive  service  or other contractual  obligations  are  fulfilled.  Included  in
other current liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $25 million and $23 million, respectively.
Those amounts represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period.

Advances  that  are  no  longer  refundable  are  reclassified  to  contributions.  Contributions  are  permanent  collections  of  plant  assets  or  cash  for  a  particular
construction project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-
investor supplied funds.

Generally,  the  Company depreciates  utility  plant  funded by contributions  and amortizes  its contributions  balance  as a reduction  to depreciation  expense,
producing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatory
guidelines,  some  of  the  Company’s  utility  subsidiaries  do  not  amortize  contributions,  and  any  contribution  received  remains  on  the  balance  sheet  indefinitely.
Amortization  of  contributions  in  aid  of  construction  was  $29  million,  $28  million and  $27  million for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2019,  2018 and  2017,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

On  January  1,  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  606,  Revenue  From  Contracts  With  Customers,  and  all  related
amendments (collectively, “ASC 606”), using the modified retrospective approach, applied to contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under
this approach, periods prior to the adoption date have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

Under ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a
customer.  Revenue  is  recognized  when  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  promised  goods  or  services.  The  amount  of
revenue  recognized  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  Company  expects  to  be  entitled  to  receive  in  exchange  for  goods  or  services.  Under  ASC  606,  a
contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines
are  within  the  scope  of  ASC  606,  the  Company  performs  the  following  five  steps:  (i)  identifies  the  contracts  with  a  customer;  (ii)  identifies  the  performance
obligations  within  the  contract,  including  whether  any  performance  obligations  are  distinct  and  capable  of  being  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  contract;  (iii)
determines  the transaction  price;  (iv)  allocates  the  transaction  price  to the  performance  obligations  in the  contract;  and  (v) recognizes  revenue  when, or as,  the
Company satisfies each performance obligation.

85

Table of Contents

The Company’s revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within 30 days of billing
and none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed one year; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing component
practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.

Regulated Businesses Revenue

Revenue  from  the  Company’s  Regulated  Businesses  is  generated  primarily  from  water  and  wastewater  services  delivered  to  customers.  These  contracts
contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately
identifiable  from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  are
generally  no  significant  financing  components  or  variable  consideration.  Revenues  include  amounts  billed  to  customers  on  a  cycle  basis  and  unbilled  amounts
calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts
that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value
transferred to the customer. The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to
be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.

Market-Based Businesses Revenue

Through various warranty protection programs and other home services, the Company provides fixed fee services to residential customers for interior and
exterior  water  and  sewer  lines,  interior  electric  and  gas  lines,  heating  and  cooling  systems,  water  heaters  and  other  home  appliances,  as  well  as  power  surge
protection and other related services. Most of the contracts have a one-year term and each service is a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the
customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service. Customers are obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12
months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services. Advances from customers are deferred until the performance
obligation is satisfied.

The Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military
installations and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers, and prior to the sale of Keystone Clearwater Solutions, LLC (“Keystone”), the Company
had shorter-term contracts that provided customized water transfer services for shale natural gas companies and customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the
fixed  fee  revenues  occurs  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  contract,  as  customers  simultaneously  receive  and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  the  Company.
Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or
amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital
improvements  are  separate  performance  obligations,  with  revenue  recognized  over  time  based  on  performance  completed  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period.
Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of
billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition
criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues, and are recognized in
the period in which revisions are determined. See Note 3—Revenue Recognition for additional information.

Income Taxes

The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  participate  in  a  consolidated  federal  income  tax  return  for  U.S.  tax  purposes.  Members  of  the  consolidated  group  are

charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.

Certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Company
provides  deferred  income  taxes  on  the  difference  between  the  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  amounts  at  which  they  are  carried  in  the  financial
statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. In
addition,  the  regulated  utility  subsidiaries  recognize  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  effect  on  revenues  expected  to  be  realized  as  the  tax  effects  of
temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.

Investment tax credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives of

the related assets.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collected

from customers and remitted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 14—Income Taxes for additional information.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds
devoted to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable to
borrowed funds is shown as a reduction of interest, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds would
be included in other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Presented in the table below is AFUDC for the years ended December 31:

Environmental Costs

The  Company’s  water  and  wastewater  operations  and  the  operations  of  its  Market-Based Businesses are  subject  to  U.S. federal,  state,  local  and  foreign
requirements  relating  to  environmental  protection,  and  as  such,  the  Company  periodically  becomes  subject  to  environmental  claims  in  the  normal  course  of
business. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations or provide a future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be
reasonably estimated. A conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2010
and amended in 2017 required the subsidiary to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the Carmel
River watershed in the State of California. The subsidiary agreed to pay $1 million annually commencing in 2010 with the final payment being made in 2021.
Remediation costs accrued amounted to $2 million and $4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are entered
into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into
derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.

All  derivatives  are  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  On  the  date  the  derivative  contract  is  entered  into,  the  Company  may  designate  the
derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to
be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged item, are recorded in current-period earnings. The gains
and losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
Any ineffective portion of designated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.

Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 11—

Long-Term Debt for additional information.

New Accounting Standards

Presented in the table below are new accounting standards that were adopted by the Company in 2019:

Description

Updated the accounting and disclosure guidance for leasing
arrangements. Under this guidance, a lessee is required to recognize
the following for all leases, excluding short-term leases, at the
commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation
to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a
discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that
represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified
asset for the lease term. A package of optional transition practical
expedients allows an entity not to reassess under the new guidance: (i)
whether any expired or existing contracts as of the adoption date are
or contain leases; (ii) lease classification; and (iii) initial direct costs.
Additional, optional transition practical expedients are available which
allow an entity not to evaluate expired or existing land easements as of
the adoption date if the easements were not previously accounted for
as leases; and to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and
recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment in the opening balance of
retained earnings in the period of adoption.
Updated the accounting and disclosure guidance for hedging activities,
allowing for more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies to be
eligible for hedge accounting. Under this guidance, a qualitative
effectiveness assessment is permitted for certain hedges if an entity
can reasonably support an expectation of high effectiveness
throughout the term of the hedge, provided that an initial quantitative
test establishes that the hedge relationship is highly effective. Also, for
cash flow hedges determined to be highly effective, all changes in the
fair value of the hedging instrument will be recorded in other
comprehensive income, with a subsequent reclassification to earnings
when the hedged item impacts earnings.
Designated the OIS rate based on SOFR as an eligible U.S. benchmark
interest rate for the purposes of applying hedge accounting.

Description

Updated the accounting guidance on reporting credit losses for
financial assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt
securities. Under this guidance, expected credit losses are required to
be measured based on historical experience, current conditions and
reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of
the reported amount of financial assets. Also, this guidance requires
that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as
an allowance rather than as a direct write-down.
Updated the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. The
guidance removes the requirements to disclose transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, the timing of transfers between
levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 measurements.
Disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 3 measurements will be
required. The guidance adds disclosure requirements for the change in
unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income for
recurring Level 3 measurements, as well as the range and weighted
average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3
measurements.
Simplified the accounting for income taxes by removing certain
exceptions and by adding certain requirements. The guidance removes
exceptions related to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax
allocation, the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for
changes in ownership of a foreign subsidiary or equity method
investment, and the general methodology for calculating income taxes
in an interim period when the year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated
loss. The guidance adds requirements to reflect changes to tax laws or
rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period
in which the changes were enacted, to recognize franchise or other
similar taxes that are partially based on income as an income-based
tax and any incremental amounts as non-income-based tax, and to
evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be
considered part of the business combination in which the book
goodwill was originally recognized and when it should be considered
a separate transaction.

Contract Balances

Contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  are  the  result  of  timing  differences  between  revenue  recognition,  billings  and  cash  collections.  In  the  Company’s
Market-Based Businesses, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon
achievement  of  contractual  milestones.  Contract  assets  are  recorded  when  billing  occurs  subsequent  to  revenue  recognition  and  are  reclassified  to  accounts
receivable  when  billed  and  the  right  to  consideration  becomes  unconditional.  Contract  liabilities  are  recorded  when  the  Company  receives  advances  from
customers prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts and home warranty protection program contracts, and are
recognized  as  revenue  when  the  associated  performance  obligations  are  satisfied.  Contract  assets  are  included  in  unbilled  revenues  and  contract  liabilities  are
included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019.

Remaining performance obligations (“RPOs”) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress. The
Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. As of
December 31, 2019, the Company’s O&M and capital improvement contracts in the Market-Based Businesses have RPOs. Contracts with the U.S. government for
work on various military installations expire between 2051 and 2070 and have RPOs of $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2019, as measured by estimated remaining
contract  revenue.  Such  contracts  are  subject  to  customary  termination  provisions  held  by  the  U.S.  government,  prior  to  the  agreed-upon  contract  expiration.
Contracts with municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2021 and 2038 and have RPOs of $547 million as of December 31, 2019, as measured by
estimated  remaining  contract  revenue.  Some  of  the Company’s  long-term  contracts  to  operate  and  maintain  a  municipality’s,  the  federal  government’s  or  other
party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual
fee. Unless specifically required to perform certain maintenance activities, the maintenance costs are recognized when the maintenance is performed.

Note 4: Acquisitions and Divestitures

Regulated Businesses

Acquisitions

During  2019,  the  Company  closed  on  21 acquisitions  of  various  regulated  water  and  wastewater  systems  for  a  total  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $235
million. Assets acquired, principally utility plant, totaled $237 million. Liabilities assumed, primarily contributions in aid of construction, totaled $5 million. The
Company recorded additional goodwill of $3 million associated with three of its acquisitions, which is reported in its Regulated Businesses segment, all of which is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. These acquisitions were predominately accounted for as business combinations, as the Company continues to grow its
business  through  regulated  acquisitions.  The  preliminary  purchase  price  allocations  related  to  these  acquisitions  will  be  finalized  once  the  valuation  of  assets
acquired has been completed, no later than one year after their acquisition date.

During 2018, the Company closed on 15 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $33 million.
Assets acquired, principally utility plant, totaled $32 million. Liabilities assumed, primarily contributions in aid of construction, totaled $1 million. The Company
recorded additional goodwill of $2 million associated with  one of its acquisitions, which is reported in its  Regulated Businesses segment. Of this total goodwill,
none is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

During  2017,  the  Company  closed  on  18 acquisitions  of  various  regulated  water  and  wastewater  systems  for  a  total  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $210
million. This included the acquisition of the wastewater system assets of the Municipal Authority of the City of McKeesport, Pennsylvania, on December 18, 2017.
Assets acquired, principally utility plant, totaled $207 million. Liabilities assumed totaled $23 million, including $9 million of contributions in aid of construction
and  assumed  debt  of  $7  million.  The  Company  recorded  additional  goodwill  of  $29  million associated  with  four of  its  acquisitions,  which  is  reported  in  its
Regulated  Businesses segment.  Of  this  total  goodwill,  approximately  $1  million is  expected  to  be  deductible  for  tax  purposes.  Additionally,  the  Company
recognized a bargain purchase gain of $3 million associated with three of the acquisitions.

Assets Held for Sale

On  November  20,  2019,  the  Company  and  the  Company’s  New  York  subsidiary,  entered  into  a  Stock  Purchase  Agreement  (the  “Stock  Purchase
Agreement”)  with  Liberty  Utilities  Co.  (“Liberty”),  pursuant  to  which  Liberty  will  purchase  all  of  the  capital  stock  of  the  New  York  subsidiary  (the  “Stock
Purchase”)  for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  approximately  $608 million in  cash,  subject  to  adjustment  as  provided  in  the  Stock  Purchase  Agreement.  The
Company’s  New  York  operations  have  approximately  125,000 customer  connections  in  the  State  of  New  York.  Algonquin  Power  &  Utilities  Corp.,  Liberty’s
parent company, executed and delivered an absolute and unconditional guaranty of the performance of all of the obligations of Liberty under the Stock Purchase
Agreement.

The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The completion of the Stock Purchase is subject to various
conditions, including without limitation: (1) obtaining the approval of the New York State Public Service Commission without any terms or conditions that would
reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Company or its affiliates (other than the New York subsidiary or its affiliates) or have a material adverse effect (as
defined  in  the  Stock  Purchase  Agreement)  on  the  New  York  subsidiary  or  its  affiliates  or  on  Liberty  and  its  affiliates;  (2)  the  expiration  or  termination  of  the
applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; and (3) other customary closing conditions, including
(a) subject to materiality qualifiers, the accuracy of the parties’ representations and warranties contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement; (b) the absence of any
law  or  order  prohibiting  the  completion  of  the  Stock  Purchase  or  granting  substantial  damages  in  connection  therewith;  (c)  the  absence  of  any  proceeding
(excluding any such matter initiated by Liberty or any of its affiliates) pending before any governmental authority seeking to prohibit the completion of the Stock
Purchase or recover substantial damages from Liberty or any affiliate resulting from the Stock Purchase; and (d) the compliance by the parties with their respective
covenants, agreements and closing deliveries under the Stock Purchase Agreement. The Company currently estimates that the Stock Purchase is to be completed by
early 2021. Accordingly, the assets and related liabilities of the New York subsidiary were classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

The Stock Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Liberty, including if the Stock Purchase is not consummated
by June  30, 2021 (subject  to  extension  for  an  additional  six  months  if  all  of  the  conditions  to  closing,  other  than  the  conditions  related  to  obtaining  regulatory
approvals, have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied), as well as a termination right for Liberty if any governmental authority initiates a condemnation or
eminent domain proceeding against a majority of the consolidated properties of the New York subsidiary, taken as a whole. If the Stock Purchase Agreement is
terminated, such termination will be without liability of any party to the other parties to the Stock Purchase Agreement, except for liability or damages resulting
from a willful breach of a party’s representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Stock Purchase Agreement prior to termination.

Presented  in  the  table  below  are  the  components  of  assets  held  for  sale  and  liabilities  related  to  assets  held  for  sale  of  the  New  York  subsidiary  as

On June 4, 2018, the Company, through  its wholly owned subsidiary American  Water  Enterprises,  LLC, completed  the acquisition  of Pivotal for a total
purchase price of $365 million, net of cash received and including $9 million in working capital. Pivotal is complementary to the Company’s Homeowner Services
Group product  offerings  and  enhances  its  presence  in  the  home  warranty  solutions  markets  through  utility  partnerships.  The  results  of  Pivotal  have  been
consolidated into the Homeowner Services Group non-reportable operating segment.

On December  12,  2019,  as  part  of  a  strategic  review  undertaken  by  the  Company,  American  Industrial  Water  LLC,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the
Company (“AIW”), sold all of the outstanding membership interests in Water Solutions Holdings, LLC (“WSH”), which was a wholly owned subsidiary of AIW,
to a natural gas and oil industry investment group, for total cash consideration of $31 million, subject to adjustment based on post-closing working capital. WSH
was the parent company of Keystone Clearwater Solutions, LLC. Keystone provides water transportation services to shale natural gas exploration and production
customers in the Appalachian Basin. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $44 million, or $35 million after-tax, during the fourth
quarter of 2019.

The  pro  forma  impact  of  the  Company’s  acquisitions  was  not  material  to  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  for  the  years  ended  December  31,

2019, 2018 and 2017.

Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense amounted to $508 million, $497 million and $460 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively and was included in depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provision for depreciation
expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  aggregate  average  depreciable  asset  balances  was  2.96%,  3.09% and  3.07% for  years  December  31,  2019,  2018 and  2017,
respectively.

In  2019,  the  Company  completed  and  submitted  its  project  completion  certification  to  the  New  Jersey  Economic  Development  Authority  (“NJEDA”)  in
connection with its capital investment in its corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The NJEDA has determined that the Company is qualified to receive
$164 million in tax credits over a ten year period. The Company is required to meet various annual requirements in order to monetize one-tenth of the tax credits
annually, and is subject to a claw-back period if the Company does not meet certain NJEDA requirements of the tax credit program in years 11 through 15. As a
result,  the  Company  recorded  receivables  of  $16 million and  $148 million in  other  current  assets  and  other  long-term  assets,  respectively,  on the  Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019.

Sheets. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.

The Company’s deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $375
million and $352 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The remaining portion is the pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the
pension plans which is deferred by certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension plan.

Removal costs recoverable through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs.

Regulatory  balancing  accounts  accumulate  differences  between  revenues  recognized  and  authorized  revenue  requirements  until  they  are  collected  from

customers or are refunded. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs and purchased power and water accounts.

Other regulatory assets include San Clemente Dam project costs, debt expense, purchase premium recoverable through rates, tank painting costs, certain
construction  costs  for  treatment  facilities,  property  tax  stabilization,  employee-related  costs,  deferred  other  postretirement  benefit  expense,  business  services
project  expenses,  coastal  water  project  costs,  rate  case  expenditures  and  environmental  remediation  costs  among  others.  These  costs  are  deferred  because  the
amounts are being recovered in rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods.

Regulatory Liabilities

Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate making process. Also, if
costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.

These regulatory liabilities are related to the pending transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and are included in liabilities related to assets held for sale on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.

Income taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Company’s customers. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA
was  signed  into  law,  which,  among  other  things,  enacted  significant  and  complex  changes  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986  (the  “Code”),  including  a
reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significant excess deferred income
taxes  that  the  Company  and  its  regulatory  jurisdictions  believe  should  be  refunded  to  customers.  Since  these  are  significant  refundable  amounts,  the  Company
believes it is probable these amounts will be refunded to customers through future rates, and as such the amounts have been recorded to a regulatory liability.

During 2018, the Company’s 14 regulatory jurisdictions began to seek to address the impacts of the TCJA. The Company has adjusted customer rates to
reflect  the  lower  income  tax  rate  in  11 states.  In  one of  those  11 states,  a  portion  of  the  tax  savings  is  being  used  to  reduce  certain  regulatory  assets.  In  one
additional  state,  the  Company  is  using  the  tax  savings  to  offset  additional  capital  investment  and  to  reduce  a  regulatory  asset.  Proceedings  in  the  other  two
jurisdictions remain pending. With respect to excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”), six of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are amortizing
EADIT  and  crediting  customers,  including  one which  is  using  the  EADIT  to  offset  future  infrastructure  investments.  The  Company  expects  the  timing  of  the
amortization of EADIT credits by the eight remaining regulated subsidiaries to be addressed in pending or future rate cases or other proceedings.

Removal costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful lives that are recovered through customer rates

over the lives of the associated assets.

On August 31, 2018, the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certain
union and non-union plan participants. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a $227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation, with a corresponding regulatory liability.

Other  regulatory  liabilities  include  TCJA  reserve  on  revenue,  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  balancing  accounts,  legal  settlement  proceeds,

deferred gains and various regulatory balancing accounts.

This goodwill is related to the pending transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and is included in assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note
4—Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.

In 2019, the Company acquired goodwill of $3 million associated with three of its acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses segment. Additionally, as part of
the  sale  of  the  Company’s  Keystone  operations  on  December  12,  2019,  the  Company  reduced  goodwill,  net,  by  $38  million.  See  Note  4—Acquisitions  and
Divestitures for additional information.

The  Company  completed  its  annual  impairment  testing  of  goodwill  as  of  November 30, 2019, which included  quantitative  assessments  of its  Regulated
Businesses, Homeowner Services Group and  Military Services Group reporting units. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that there were no
factors present that would indicate that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values as of November 30, 2019.

In 2018, the Company acquired goodwill of $247 million associated with its acquisition of Pivotal, which was allocated to the Homeowner Services Group
reporting  unit,  within  the  Market-Based Businesses.  Additionally,  the  Company  acquired  goodwill  of  $2 million associated  with  one of  its  acquisitions  in  the
Regulated Businesses segment.

During the third quarter of 2018, as a result of the narrowing the scope of the Company’s former Keystone operations, the Company concluded there were
indicators that the Keystone reporting unit may have been impaired. Accordingly, impairment testing was performed as part of the preparation of the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements during the third quarter of 2018. The results of this impairment test showed the fair value of the former Keystone reporting unit
was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $53 million. Additionally, the impairment test showed the fair
value of the former Keystone reporting unit’s customer relationship intangible asset was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax impairment
charge of $4 million. In the aggregate, a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $57 million was recorded in impairment charge on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, of which, $54 million was attributable to the Company, after adjustment for noncontrolling interest.

Under the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the “DRIP”), shareholders may reinvest cash dividends and purchase additional Company
common stock, up to certain limits, through the plan administrator without commission fees. Shares purchased by participants through the DRIP may be newly
issued shares, treasury shares, or at the Company’s election, shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Purchases generally will be made and credited to DRIP accounts once each week. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 4.2 million shares available
for future issuance under the DRIP.

Anti-dilutive Stock Repurchase Program

In February 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program, which allows the Company to purchase up to 10
million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time over an unrestricted period of time. The Company repurchased 0.4 million shares and 0.6 million
shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $36 million and $45 million under this program for the years ended  December 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, there were 5.1 million shares of common stock available for purchase under the program.

The Company does not reclassify the amortization of defined benefit pension cost components from accumulated other comprehensive loss directly to net
income in its entirety, as a portion of these costs have been capitalized as a regulatory asset. These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included
in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 15—Employee Benefits for additional information.

During the second quarter of 2019, the Company substantially exited its foreign operations in Canada due to a contract expiration in its Contract Services
Group. As a result, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $1 million from cumulative foreign currency translation, and a corresponding change of accumulated
other comprehensive loss.

The  amortization  of  the  gain  (loss)  on  cash  flow  hedges  is  reclassified  to  net  income  during  the  period  incurred  and  is  included  in  interest,  net  in  the

accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Dividends

The Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to having
access to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and repayments of indebtedness from
the Company’s subsidiaries, compliance with Delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements, and
other factors. The Company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among
other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared,
they are typically paid in March, June, September and December. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days prior to the
distribution date. Since the dividends on the Company’s common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company paid $353 million, $319 million and $289 million in cash dividends, respectively. Presented in the table below is

the per share cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31:

On December 6, 2019,  the  Company’s  Board of  Directors  declared  a  quarterly  cash dividend  payment  of  $0.50 per share payable on  March 4, 2020, to

shareholders of record as of February 7, 2020.

Regulatory Restrictions

The issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or long-term debt by American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), the Company’s wholly
owned financing subsidiary, does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. However, state PUC
authorization  is  required  to  issue  long-term  debt  at  most  of  the  Company’s  regulated  subsidiaries.  The  Company’s  regulated  subsidiaries  normally  obtain  the
required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing.

Under applicable law, the Company’s subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at a
subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to American Water. Furthermore, the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay upstream
dividends  or  repay  indebtedness  to  American  Water  is  subject  to  compliance  with  applicable  regulatory  restrictions  and  financial  obligations,  including,  for
example, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations, and other agreements or
covenants made or entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries.

Note 10: Stock Based Compensation

The Company has granted stock options, stock units and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Company
pursuant to the terms of its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Stock units under the 2007 Plan generally vest based on (i) continued
employment with the Company (“RSUs”), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in whole
or in part of stated performance-based goals (“PSUs”). The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 Omnibus Plan, as defined below, and no additional awards
may be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the terms of awards previously issued under that plan
prior to May 12, 2017.

In  May  2017,  the  Company’s  shareholders  approved  the  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  2017  Omnibus  Equity  Compensation  Plan  (the  “2017
Omnibus Plan”). The Company has granted stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and
employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. A total of 7.2 million shares of common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2019,
6.8 million shares were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the following
forms: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents.
Dividend equivalents may be granted only on stock units or other stock-based awards. The 2017 Omnibus Plan expires in 2027.

The cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant date
fair value of the awards issued. The value of stock options and stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service
period.  All awards granted  in 2019, 2018 and  2017 are classified  as equity.  The Company recognizes  compensation  expense for stock awards over the vesting
period of the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate is
compared  to  the  actual  forfeitures  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  and  adjusted  as  necessary.  Presented  in  the  table  below  is  the  stock-based  compensation
expense recorded in O&M expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31:

The Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stock
units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company recognizes the tax benefits, which have been included in deferred income tax assets,
related  to  compensation  costs.  The  tax  deductions  in  excess  of  the  benefits  recorded  throughout  the  requisite  service  period  are  recorded  to  the  Consolidated
Statements of Operations and are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Stock Options

There were no grants of stock options to employees in  2019, 2018 and 2017. The stock options that were previously issued vested ratably over the three-
year service period beginning on January 1 of the year of the grant and have no performance vesting conditions. Expense was recognized using the straight-line
method and was amortized over the requisite service period.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees under the 2007 Plan and 2017 Omnibus Plan, as applicable. RSUs generally

vest based on continued employment with the Company over periods ranging from one to three years.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The stock units were vested in full
on the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlier of (i)  15 months after the date of the last annual meeting of
shareholders, subject to any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participant’s separation from service. Because these stock units vested on the grant date, the
total grant date fair value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.

The RSUs are valued at the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over a three-year service

period. These RSUs are amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.

As of December 31, 2019, $4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested RSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted
average  remaining  life  of  1.72 years.  The  total  fair  value  of  stock  units  and  RSUs  vested  was  $4  million,  $4  million and  $3  million for  the  years  ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company granted PSUs to certain employees under the 2007 Plan and 2017 Omnibus Plan, as applicable. The majority of
PSUs vest  ratably  based  on  continued  employment  with  the  Company  over  the  three-year  performance  period  (the  “Performance  Period”).  Distribution  of  the
performance  shares  is  contingent  upon  the  achievement  of  one  or  more  internal  performance  measures  and,  separately,  a  relative  total  shareholder  return
performance measure, over the Performance Period.

As of December 31, 2019, $4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested PSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted

average remaining life of 1.09 years. The total fair value of PSUs vested was  $14 million, $12 million and $13 million for the years ended  December 31, 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively.

PSUs granted with one or more internal performance measures are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the
date  of  grant.  PSUs  granted  with  a  relative  total  shareholder  return  condition  are  valued  using  a  Monte  Carlo  model.  Expected  volatility  is  based  on  historical
volatilities of traded common stock of the Company and comparative companies using daily stock prices over the past three years. The expected term is three years
and  the  risk-free  interest  rate  is  based  on  the  three-year  U.S.  Treasury  rate  in  effect  as  of  the  measurement  date.  Presented  in  the  table  below  is  the  weighted
average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation and the weighted average grant date fair values of PSUs granted for the years ended December 31:

If dividends are paid with respect to shares of the Company’s common stock before the shares underlying the RSUs and PSUs are distributed, the Company
credits  a  liability  for  the  value  of  the  dividends  that  would  have  been  paid  if  the  RSUs  and  PSUs  were  shares  of  Company  common  stock.  When  the  shares
underlying the RSUs and PSUs are distributed, the Company pays the participant a lump sum cash payment equal to the value of the dividend equivalents accrued.
The  Company  accrued  dividend  equivalents  totaling  $1 million, $1 million and  less  than  $1 million to  accumulated  deficit  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated
Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) that expires in 2027 through which employee participants (other than
the Company’s executive officers) may use payroll deductions to acquire Company common stock at a discount of 85% of the fair market value of the common
stock at the end of the purchase period. A total of 2.0 million shares may be issued under the ESPP, and as of December 31, 2019, there were 1.8 million shares of
common  stock  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  ESPP.  The  ESPP  is  considered  compensatory.  During  the  years  ended  December 31, 2019, 2018 and  2017, the
Company issued 88 thousand, 95 thousand and 93 thousand shares, respectively, under the ESPP and its predecessor plan.

Note 11: Long-Term Debt

The  Company  obtains  long-term  debt  through  AWCC  primarily  to  fund  capital  expenditures  of  the  Regulated  Businesses and  to  lend  funds  to  parent

company of AWCC’s payment obligations under such indebtedness.

Includes $3 million and $3 million of variable rate debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps ranging between 3.93% and 4.65%.
This debt was assumed via an acquisition in 2013.

(c)

Primarily fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting.

All  mortgage  bonds,  term  loans  and  $723 million of  the  private  activity  bonds  and  government  funded  debt  held  by  the  Company’s  subsidiaries  were

collateralized as of December 31, 2019.

Long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, AWCC from issuing debt secured
by the Company’s consolidated assets. Certain long-term notes require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total
capitalization  of  not  more  than  0.70 to  1.00.  The  ratio  as  of  December 31, 2019 was  0.61 to  1.00.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  $877 million of  notes  which
include the right to redeem the notes at par value, in whole or in part, from time to time, subject to certain restrictions.

On May 13, 2019, AWCC completed a $1.10 billion debt offering which included the sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.45% Senior
Notes due 2029 and $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.15% Senior Notes due 2049. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deduction
of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1.09 billion. AWCC used the net proceeds to: (i) lend funds
to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) repay $25 million principal amount of AWCC’s 7.21% Series I Senior Notes at maturity on May 19, 2019;
(iii) repay $26 million aggregate principal amount of regulated subsidiary debt at maturity during the second quarter of 2019; and (iv) repay AWCC’s commercial
paper obligations, and for general corporate purposes.

Interest, net includes interest income of approximately $4 million, $11 million and $14 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

One of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk
management  policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managing
commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company also does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.
The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to
derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions having
long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.

On May 6, 2019, AWCC terminated five forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $510 million, realizing a net loss of $30
million, to be amortized through interest, net over 10 and 30 year periods, in accordance with the terms of the new debt issued on May 13, 2019. No ineffectiveness
was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The Company has employed interest rate swaps to fix the interest cost on a portion of its variable-rate debt with an aggregate notional amount of $3 million.
The  Company  has  designated  these  instruments  as  economic  hedges,  accounted  for  at  fair  value,  with  gains  or  losses  recognized  in  interest,  net.  The  gain
recognized by the Company was de minimis for the years ended 2019 and 2018.

Presented  in  the  table  below  are  the  gross  fair  values  of  the  Company’s  derivative  liabilities,  as  well  as  the  location  of  the  liability  balances  on  the

Note 12: Short-Term Debt

Short-term debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $786 million and  $964 million as of  December 31, 2019 and  2018,
respectively. The weighted average interest rate on AWCC short-term borrowings was approximately 2.54% and 2.28% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 there were no borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.

Liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are funded through cash flows from operations, public and private
debt offerings, commercial paper markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility and, in the future, issuances of
equity. The revolving credit facility provides $2.25 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. On April 9, 2019, the
termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility was extended, pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, from March
21, 2023 to March 21, 2024. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for
letters of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. Subject to
satisfying  certain  conditions,  the  credit  agreement  also  permits  AWCC to increase  the  maximum  commitment  under  the  facility  by up to  an  aggregate  of  $500
million,  and  to  request  up  to  two extensions  of  its  expiration  date  each  for  up  to  a  one-year  period,  as  to  which  one  such  extension  request  remains.  As  of
December 31, 2019, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with  $2.17 billion
available  to  fulfill  the  Company’s  short-term  liquidity  needs  and  to  issue  letters  of  credit.  The  Company  regularly  evaluates  the  capital  markets  and  closely
monitors  the  financial  condition  of  the  financial  institutions  with  contractual  commitments  in  its  revolving  credit  facility.  Interest  rates  on  advances  under  the
facility  are  based on a credit  spread  to the  LIBOR rate  (or applicable  market  replacement  rate)  or base rate  in accordance  with Moody Investors  Service’s  and
Standard & Poor’s Financial Services’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt.

Presented in the table below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, letter of credit sublimit under the revolving credit facility and the commercial

The credit facility requires the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The ratio as of

December 31, 2019 was 0.61 to 1.00.

None of the Company’s borrowings  are subject  to default  or prepayment  as a result of a downgrading of securities,  although such a downgrading could

increase fees and interest charges under AWCC’s revolving credit facility.

As part of the normal course of business, the Company routinely enters contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services. These
contracts  either  contain  express  provisions  or  otherwise  permit  the  Company  and  its  counterparties  to  demand  adequate  assurance  of  future  performance  when
there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency,
especially  if  such  downgrade  is  to  a  level  below  investment  grade,  it  is  possible  that  a  counterparty  would  attempt  to  rely  on  such  a  downgrade  as  a  basis  for
making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance.  Depending on the Company’s net position with the counterparty, the demand could be for the
posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, the obligation to supply the collateral requested
will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the Company’s situation at the time of the demand. If the Company can reasonably claim that it is willing and
financially able to perform its obligations, it may be possible that no collateral would need to be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of
future payments should be sufficient. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

On December  22,  2017,  the  TCJA  was  signed  into  law.  Substantially  all  of  the  provisions  of  the  TCJA  are  effective  for  taxable  years  beginning  after
December  31,  2017.  The  TCJA  includes  significant  changes  to  the  Code,  including  amendments  which  significantly  change  the  taxation  of  individuals  and
business entities, and includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact the Company included in the TCJA
are reductions in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and several technical provisions including, among others, limiting the utilization of net
operating losses (“NOLs”) arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. The specific provisions related to regulated
public utilities in the TCJA generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the elimination of full expensing for tax purposes of certain property
acquired after September 27, 2017 and the continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. Non-regulated segments of
the Company’s business may be able to take advantage of the full expensing provisions of the TCJA.

Changes in the Code from the TCJA had a material impact on the Company’s financial statements in 2017. Under GAAP, specifically Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740
also requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or
settled. Thus, at the date of enactment, the Company’s deferred income taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities,
substantially  all  of  the  change  in  deferred  income  taxes  are  recorded  as  an  offset  to  either  a  regulatory  asset  or  liability  because  changes  are  expected  to  be
recovered by or refunded to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred income taxes is recorded as a non-cash re-measurement
adjustment to earnings.

The staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the TCJA, and on December 22, 2017
issued guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) which clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available or
complete and provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting. The Company made a reasonable estimate for the
measurement  and accounting  of certain  effects  of the TCJA which were  reflected  in the financial  statements  as of December  31, 2017. The re-measurement  of
deferred  income  taxes  at  the  new  federal  tax  rate  increased  the  2017  deferred  income  tax  provision  by  $125 million for  the  year  ending  December  31,  2017.
Additionally,  the  accumulated  deferred  income  tax  liability  decreased  by  $1.39 billion and  regulatory  liabilities  increased  by  $1.51 billion,  respectively,  as  of
December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company recorded all its reasonable estimates resulting from the TCJA under SAB 118. These estimates, however, are still
subject to changes due to the future impacts of various items, including further changes in income tax laws, forecasted financial conditions and the actual tax return
filings with the tax authorities. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not identified any changes that would require its prior estimates to be modified.

ASC 740 requires the re-measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income.
Adjusting  temporary  differences  originally  recorded  to  AOCI  through  the  income  statement  result  in  disproportionate  tax  effects  remaining  in  AOCI.  As  of
December 31, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income, which  allows  companies  to  reclassify  the  income  tax  effects  of  TCJA  on  items  within  AOCI  to  retained  earnings.  As  a  result  of  the  TCJA  tax  rate
reduction,  there  were  income  tax  effects  related  to  the  Company’s  hedge  and  pension  positions  of  $2 million and  $22 million,  respectively,  remaining  in  the
Company’s  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  balance.  The  Company  reclassified  these  tax  effects  from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  to
accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018. No further adjustments were recorded during 2019 as a result of this re-measurement.

These deferred tax liabilities are related to the pending transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and are included in liabilities related to assets held for sale on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.

As of December 31, 2019 and  2018, the Company recognized federal NOL carryforwards of $673 million and  $813 million, respectively. The Company
believes  the  federal  NOL  carryforwards  are  more  likely  than  not  to  be  recovered  and  require  no  valuation  allowance.  The  Company  expects  to  fully  utilize  its
federal NOL carryforwards before they begin to expire in 2028.

As  of  December  31,  2019 and  2018,  the  Company  had  state  NOLs  of  $453 million and  $387 million,  respectively,  a  portion  of  which  are  offset  by  a
valuation allowance because the Company does not believe these NOLs are more likely than not to be realized. The state NOL carryforwards began to expire in
2019 through 2038.

The  capital  loss  carryforward  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  have  increased  from  the  previous  year  due  to  the  capital  loss  produced  by the  sale  of  the
Company’s Keystone operations. As of December 31, 2019, the capital loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes was approximately $66 million. As of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had an insignificant amount of Canadian NOL carryforward.

The  Company  files  income  tax  returns  in  the  United  States  federal  jurisdiction  and  various  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  With  few  exceptions,  the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or before 2012. The Company has
state income tax examinations in progress and does not expect material adjustments to result.

The  Company’s  tax  positions  relate  primarily  to  the  deductions  claimed  for  repair  and  maintenance  costs  on  its  utility  plant.  The  Company  does  not
anticipate material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next year. As discussed above, the Company expects to utilize its remaining federal NOLs in
2020, after the pending sale of the New York subsidiary is completed, and therefore this federal tax attribute will not be available to reduce the federal liabilities
for uncertain tax positions or interest accrued as presented on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

If the Company sustains all of its positions as of December 31, 2019, an unrecognized tax benefit of $12 million, excluding interest and penalties, would
impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had an insignificant amount of interest and penalties related to its tax positions as of December 31, 2019
and 2018.

The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations.
Benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pension
plans were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groups
specified in the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hired
on  or  after  January  1,  2001  and  non-union  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2006  are  provided  with  a  5.25% of base pay  defined  contribution  plan. The
Company does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide
additional retirement benefits to certain employees.

The Company’s pension funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to avoid “at risk”
status and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financial
requirements and the plans’ funded position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiaries
pending future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for additional
information.  Pension  plan  assets  are  invested  in  a  number  of  actively  managed,  commingled  funds,  and  limited  partnerships  including  equities,  fixed  income
securities, guaranteed annuity contracts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).

The Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfare
plans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002.
The Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number of
actively managed and commingled funds including equities and fixed income securities.

The investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over a
long-term horizon. The investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of the
Company’s securities are included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets.

The  Company  uses  fair  value  for  all  classes  of  assets  in  the  calculation  of  market-related  value  of  plan  assets.  As  of  2018,  the  fair  values  and  asset
allocations of the pension plan assets include the American Water Pension Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, and the Shorelands Water
Company, Inc. Pension Plan.

The Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and risk
mitigation  strategies  for  the  plans  are  tailored  specifically  for  each  trust.  In  setting  new  strategic  asset  mixes,  consideration  is  given  to  the  likelihood  that  the
selected asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updates
the  long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations  for  these  plans  through  asset  liability  studies  and  uses  various  analytics  to  determine  the  optimal  asset  allocation.
Considerations include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.

In 2018, the Company announced plan design changes to the medical bargaining benefit plan, which resulted in a cap on future benefits and an over funded
postretirement  medical  benefits  bargaining  plan.  Given  the  change  in  funded  status,  the  Retirement  and  Benefit  Plans  Investment  Committee  (the  “Investment
Committee”), which is responsible for overseeing the investment of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets, commissioned a new
asset-liability study for the postretirement medical bargaining plan. This study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the investment risk in the plan due to the
current funded status. The study also recommended reducing its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows
for future benefit payments of the liability. The Investment Committee approved the recommendations.

The Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixed
income,  equity,  alternatives)  or  strategy  for  which  they  have  been  appointed.  Investment  management  agreements  and  recurring  performance  and  attribution
analysis are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used to
adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.

In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are exposed
to interest rate risk. Increases in interest rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the liabilities.
Conversely,  rate  decreases  will  increase  fixed  income  assets,  partially  offsetting  the  related  increase  in  the  liabilities.  Within  equities,  risk  is  mitigated  by
constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the postretirement
medical bargaining plan, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plan’s exposure to changes in interest rates.

Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of time
it takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, if
necessary. Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”) Trust assets include the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan,
the New York Water Service Corporation Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-Bargaining
Plan, and the American Water Life Insurance Trust.

Cash—Cash and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are considered

cash and are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.

Equity  securities—For  equity  securities,  the  trustees  obtain  prices  from  pricing  services,  whose  prices  are  obtained  from  direct  feeds  from  market
exchanges, that the Company is able to independently corroborate. Certain equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as
Level 1. Other equities, such as international securities held in the pension plan, are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds are
valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since net asset value is not directly observable or not available
on  a  nationally  recognized  securities  exchange  for  the  commingled  funds,  they  are  categorized  as  Level  2.  For  limited  partnerships,  the  assets  as  a  whole  are
categorized as Level 3 due to the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In addition, the limited partnership
vehicle cannot be readily traded.

112

Table of Contents

Fixed-income securities—The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-
liquid and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bonds
are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. They are categorized as Level 2 because the
valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-traded options and futures, for which
market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are
traded and are classified as Level 1.

Real estate fund—Real estate fund is categorized as Level 3 as the fund uses significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurement and the vehicle is in

the form of a limited partnership.

REITs—REITs are invested in commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-

end net asset value. Since the net asset value is not directly observable for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2.

Guaranteed annuity contracts—Guaranteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these market
values  are  determined  by  the  provider,  they  are  not  highly  observable  and  have  been  categorized  as  Level  3.  Exchange-traded  future  and  option  positions  are
reported in accordance with changes in variation margins that are settled daily.

On August 31, 2018, the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect a plan change. The plan change resulted in a $175 million reduction
in  future  benefits  payable  to  plan  participants,  and,  in  combination  with  other  experience  reflected  as  of  the  remeasurement  date,  resulted  in  a  $227
million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.

The accumulated postretirement plan assets exceed benefit obligations for all of the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans, except for the Northern

Illinois Retiree Welfare Plan.

In  2006,  the  PPA  replaced  the  funding  requirements  for  defined  benefit  pension  plans  by  requiring  that  defined  benefit  plans  contribute  to  100%  of  the
current liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being “at risk”
and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPA was effective for the 2008 plan year with short-term phase-in provisions for both
the  funding  target  and  at-risk  determination.  The  Company’s  qualified  defined  benefit  plan  is  currently  funded  above  the  at-risk  threshold,  and  therefore  the
Company expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plan’s funded
status and projected contributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.

Minimum  funding  requirements  for  the  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  are  determined  by  government  regulations  and  not  by  accounting
pronouncements. The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2020 to the
qualified pension plans. Contributions may be in the form of cash contributions as well as available prefunding balances.

Presented in the table below is information about the expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans:

Because the above amounts are net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,
the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. The
assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital
markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes.

Presented in the table below are the significant assumptions related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:

The  discount  rate  assumption  was  determined  for  the  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  plans  independently.  The  Company  uses  an  approach  that
approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected
maturity values of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that would produce the same
present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.

Table of Contents

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment management
fees, for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes were
selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation
for  each  asset  class,  the  overall  expected  rate  of  return  for  the  portfolio  was  developed,  adjusted  for  historical  and  expected  experience  of  active  portfolio
management results compared to the benchmark returns. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Company used
an  expected  return  on  plan  assets  of  6.20% to  estimate  its  2019  pension  benefit  costs,  and  an  expected  blended  return  based  on  weighted  assets  of  3.56% to
estimate its 2019 other postretirement benefit costs.

The  Company adopted  a  table  based  on  the  Society  of Actuaries  RP 2014  mortality  table  including  a  generational  BB-2D projection  scale.  In 2018, the
Company adopted the new MP-2018 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward. In 2019, the Company maintained the MP-
2018 mortality improvement scale until it can conduct a new experience study.

The Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments  when the total expected future service of plan participants  is reduced by greater than 10% due to an

event that results in terminations and/or retirements.

Cumulative gains and losses that are in excess of 10% of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized

over the expected average remaining future service of the current active membership for the plans.

Savings Plans for Employees

The Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions that
are invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject to
certain limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing an
additional 5.25% of  base  pay  defined  contribution  benefit  for  union  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2001  and  non-union  employees  hired  on  or  after
January  1,  2006.  The  Company’s  401(k)  savings  plan  expenses  totaled  $12  million,  $12  million and  $13  million for  2019,  2018 and  2017,  respectively.
Additionally, the Company’s 5.25% of base pay defined contribution benefit expenses totaled  $13 million, $11 million and $9 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. All of the Company’s contributions are invested in one or more funds at the direction of the employees.

customers. See Note 3—Revenue Recognition for additional information regarding the Company’s performance obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is routinely involved in legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has accrued
approximately  $17  million of  probable  loss  contingencies  and  has  estimated  that  the  maximum  amount  of  losses  associated  with  reasonably  possible  loss
contingencies  that  can  be  reasonably  estimated  is  $25 million.  For  certain  matters,  claims  and  actions,  the  Company  is  unable  to  estimate  possible  losses.  The
Company  believes  that  damages  or  settlements,  if  any,  recovered  by  plaintiffs  in  such  matters,  claims  or  actions,  other  than  as  described  in  this  Note  16—
Commitments and Contingencies, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill

On  June  8,  2018,  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  West  Virginia  granted  final  approval  of  a  settlement  class  and  global  class  action
settlement (the “Settlement”) for all claims and potential claims by all class members (collectively, the “West Virginia Plaintiffs”) arising out of the January 2014
Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of the Settlement was July 16, 2018. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement,
West Virginia-American Water Company (“WVAWC”) and certain other Company affiliated entities did not admit, and will not admit, any fault or liability for
any of the allegations made by the West Virginia Plaintiffs in any of the actions that were resolved.

The  aggregate  pre-tax  amount  contributed  by  WVAWC  of  the  $126  million portion  of  the  Settlement  with  respect  to  the  Company,  net  of  insurance
recoveries, is $19 million. As of December 31, 2019, $5 million of that $126 million has been reflected in accrued liabilities, and $5 million in offsetting insurance
receivables have been reflected in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount reflected in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2019
reflects reductions in the liability and appropriate reductions to the offsetting insurance receivable reflected in other current assets, associated with the ongoing
processing of actual and potential Settlement claims. The Company funded WVAWC’s contributions to the Settlement through existing sources of liquidity.

Dunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation

On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of
WVAWC’s West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately
25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,
2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20%
by  the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking,  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  was
reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully
restored by July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by this event.

On June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha
County on behalf of an alleged  class of residents  and business owners who lost water service  or pressure  as a result of the Dunbar main break.  The complaint
alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence
by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost
profits, annoyance and inconvenience,  and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe
failure and a large outage.

In  October  2017,  WVAWC  filed  with  the  court  a  motion  seeking  to  dismiss  all  of  the  Jeffries plaintiffs’  counts alleging  statutory  and common  law tort
claims.  Furthermore,  WVAWC  asserted  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia,  and  not  the  court,  has  primary  jurisdiction  over  allegations
involving violations of the applicable tariff, the public utility code and related rules. In May 2018, the court, at a hearing, denied WVAWC’s motion to apply the
primary  jurisdiction  doctrine,  and  in  October  2018,  the  court  issued  a  written  order  to  that  effect.  On  February  21,  2019,  the  court  issued  an  order  denying
WVAWC’s motion  to dismiss  the Jeffries plaintiffs’  tort  claims.  On August 21, 2019, the  court  set  a  procedural  schedule  in this  case,  including  a  trial  date  of
September 21, 2020. Discovery in this case is ongoing. On February 4, 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach
of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. A hearing on class certification is
currently scheduled for March 11, 2020.

The Company and WVAWC believe  that  WVAWC has meritorious  defenses  to  the claims  raised  in this class  action  complaint.  WVAWC is vigorously
defending itself against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range of
such losses related to this proceeding.

Chattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Action Litigation

On September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“TAWC”), experienced a break of a 36-inch
water transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main
break by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon on September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all
customers on September 16, 2019.

On September  17, 2019, a complaint  captioned  Bruce,  et  al.  v.  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.,  et al.  was  filed  in  the  Circuit  Court  of  Hamilton
County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and American Water Works Service Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the
“Tennessee-American Water Defendants”), on behalf of an alleged class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result of
the  Chattanooga  main  break  (the  “Tennessee  Plaintiffs”).  The  complaint  alleges  breach  of  contract  and  negligence  against  the  Tennessee-American  Water
Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. The Tennessee Plaintiffs seek an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses,
business  and  economic  losses,  out-of-pocket  expenses,  loss  of  use  and  enjoyment  of  property  and  annoyance  and  inconvenience,  as  well  as  punitive  damages,
attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest.

On November 22, 2019, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief

may be granted, and, with respect to the Company, for lack of personal jurisdiction. A hearing on this motion is scheduled for February 18, 2020.

The  Tennessee-American  Water  Defendants  believe  that  they  have  meritorious  defenses  to  the  claims  raised  in  this  class  action  complaint,  and  they  are
vigorously defending themselves against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any
loss or a range of such losses related to this proceeding.

The effect of dilutive common stock equivalents is related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs granted under the Company’s 2007 Plan and 2017
Omnibus Plan, as well as estimated shares to be purchased under the Company’s 2017 Nonqualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Less than one million share-
based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, because their effect would have been
anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.

Note 18: Fair Value of Financial Information

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Current assets and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, including

revolving credit debt, due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.

Preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements
and long-term  debt  are categorized  within  the fair  value  hierarchy  based  on the inputs that are  used to value  each instrument.  The fair value  of long-term  debt
classified as Level 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valued
using observable and unobservable inputs. The fair values of instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3 are determined by a valuation model that is based on a
conventional discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market rates. The Company calculated a base yield curve using a risk-free rate
(a  U.S. Treasury  securities  yield  curve)  plus  a  credit  spread  that  is  based  on the  following  two factors:  an  average  of  the  Company’s  own publicly-traded  debt
securities and the current market rates for U.S. Utility A debt securities. The Company used these yield curve assumptions to derive a base yield for the Level 2
and Level 3 securities. Additionally, the Company adjusted the base yield for specific features of the debt securities including call features, coupon tax treatment
and collateral for the Level 3 instruments.

Presented in the tables below are the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and the

Fair Value Measurements

To  increase  consistency  and  comparability  in  fair  value  measurements,  GAAP  establishes  a  fair  value  hierarchy  that  prioritizes  the  inputs  to  valuation

techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:

Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.
Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs  include  active  exchange-traded  equity  securities,  exchange-based  derivatives,  mutual  funds  and  money
market funds.

Level  2—Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  Level  1  that  are  directly  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  or  indirectly  observable  through
corroboration  with  observable  market  data.  Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  2  inputs  include  fixed  income  securities,  non-exchange-based
derivatives, commingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.

Level  3—Unobservable  inputs,  such  as  internally-developed  pricing  models  for  the  asset  or  liability  due  to  little  or  no  market  activity  for  the  asset  or
liability.  Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  3  inputs  include  infrequently-traded  non-exchange-based  derivatives  and  commingled  investment  funds
subject to purchase and sale restrictions.

Restricted funds—The Company’s restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement of
facilities and from customers for future services under operation, maintenance and repair projects. Long-term restricted funds of less than $1 million and $1 million
were included in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Rabbi  trust  investments—The  Company’s  rabbi  trust  investments  consist  of  equity  and  index  funds  from  which  supplemental  executive  retirement  plan

benefits and deferred compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Deposits—Deposits  include  escrow  funds  and  certain  other  deposits  held  in  trust.  The  Company  includes  cash  deposits  in  other  current  assets  on  the

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Deferred  compensation  obligations—The  Company’s  deferred  compensation  plans  allow  participants  to  defer  certain  cash  compensation  into  notional
investment accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferred
compensation  obligations  is  based  on  the  market  value  of  the  participants’  notional  investment  accounts.  The  notional  investments  are  comprised  primarily  of
mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices.

Mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities—The Company utilizes fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, typically designated as fair-value hedges, to
achieve a targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt. The Company also employs derivative financial instruments in the form of variable-to-
fixed interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps, classified as economic hedges and cash flow hedges, respectively, in order to fix the interest cost
on  existing  or  forecasted  debt.  The  Company  uses  a  calculation  of  future  cash  inflows  and  estimated  future  outflows,  which  are  discounted,  to  determine  the
current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility.

Other  investments—Other  investments  primarily  represent  money  market  funds  used  for  active  employee  benefits.  The  Company  includes  other

investments in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 19: Leases

On  January  1,  2019,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update 2016-02,  Leases  (Topic  842),  and  all  related  amendments  (collectively,  the
“Standard”). The Company implemented the guidance in the Standard using the modified retrospective approach and applied the optional transition method, which
allowed entities to apply the new Standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the
period of adoption. Under this approach, prior periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The Standard includes practical expedients, which relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the adoption date, initial direct
costs for leases that commenced before the adoption date, the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the
underlying asset and the ability to carry forward accounting treatment for existing land easements.

Adoption of the Standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019 of
approximately $117 million and $115 million, respectively. The difference between the ROU assets and operating lease liabilities was recorded as an adjustment to
retained earnings. The Standard did not materially impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations and had no impact on cash flows.

Certain  operating  leases  have  renewal  options  ranging  from  one to  60 years.  The  exercise  of  lease  renewal  options  is  at  the  Company’s  sole  discretion.
Renewal options that the Company was reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Company’s ROU assets. Certain operating leases contain the option to
purchase  the  leased  property.  The  operating  leases  for  real  property,  vehicles  and  equipment  will  expire  over  the  next  40 years, seven years,  and  five years,
respectively.

The Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (“Partners”) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the Company
transferred a portion of its utility plant to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”) issued by the Partners
under the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act. The Company leased back the utility plant under agreements for a period of 30 to 40
years. The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in property, plant and equipment, as ownership of the assets will revert back to the Company
at the end of the lease term. The carrying value of the finance lease assets was $147 million and $147 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The
Company  determined  that  the  finance  lease  obligations  and  the  investments  in  IDBs  meet  the  conditions  for  offsetting,  and  as  such,  are  reported  net  on  the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and excluded from the finance lease disclosure presented below.

121

Table of Contents

The Company also enters into O&M agreements with the Partners. The Company pays an annual fee for use of the Partners’ assets in performing under the
O&M  agreements.  The  O&M  agreements  are  recorded  as  operating  leases,  and  future  annual  use  fees  of  $4  million in  2020  through  2024,  and  $54  million
thereafter, are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Rental expenses under operating and finance leases presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Rental expenses under operating leases which included variable and short-term lease costs were $35 million and  $29 million for the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively.

Note 20: Segment Information

The  Company’s  operating  segments  are  comprised  of  the  revenue-generating  components  of  its  businesses  for  which  separate  financial  information  is
internally  produced  and  regularly  used  by  management  to  make  operating  decisions,  assess  performance  and  allocate  resources.  The  Company  operates  its
businesses primarily through one reportable segment, the  Regulated Businesses segment. The Company also operates market-based businesses that, individually,
do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are collectively presented as the Market-Based Businesses.

The  Regulated  Businesses  segment  is  the  largest  component  of  the  Company’s  business  and  includes  subsidiaries  that  provide  water  and  wastewater

services to customers in 16 states.

The Company’s primary Market-Based Businesses include the Homeowner Services Group, which provides various warranty protection programs and other
home services  to residential  customers,  and the  Military Services Group, which  enters  into long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S. government  to  provide  water  and
wastewater services on various military installations.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies. The Regulated Businesses segment
and Market-Based Businesses include intercompany costs that are allocated by American Water Works Service Company, Inc. and intercompany interest that is
charged by AWCC, both of which are eliminated to reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inter-segment revenues include the sale of water from
a  regulated  subsidiary  to  market-based  subsidiaries,  leased  office  space,  and  furniture  and  equipment  provided  by  the  market-based  subsidiaries  to  regulated
subsidiaries. “Other” includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Company’s operating segments, eliminations of inter-segment transactions, fair value
adjustments, and associated income and deductions related to the acquisitions that have not been allocated to the operating segments for evaluation of performance
and allocation of resource purposes. The adjustments related to the acquisitions are reported in Other as they are excluded from segment performance measures
evaluated by management.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-
15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance  that  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  the  Company  in  the  reports  it  files  or  submits  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,  processed,
summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC’s  rules  and  forms,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rule  13a-15(f)  of  the  Exchange  Act.  The  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  by  or  under  the  supervision  of  the  Chief
Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts
and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  its  management  and  its  directors,  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial  reporting,  as  of  December  31,  2019,  using  the  criteria  described  in  Internal  Control—Integrated  Framework  (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), its management concluded that its internal

control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter that have

materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B.

OTHER INFORMATION

Approval of CEO Compensation Arrangements with Walter J. Lynch

As  previously  disclosed,  in  response  to  the  previously  announced  retirement  of  Susan  N.  Story,  the  Company’s  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,
effective  April  1,  2020,  and  in  accordance  with  the  existing  succession  plan  of  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors  (the  “Board”)  for  the  Company’s  principal
executive officer position, on December 6, 2019, the Board elected Walter J. Lynch, the Company’s current Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,
to serve as successor to Susan N. Story, effective  April 1, 2020. To provide for Mr. Lynch’s compensation in his new role, the Company and Mr. Lynch have
executed an employment offer letter, dated February 12, 2020 and effective April 1, 2020, which was unanimously approved by the independent members of the
Board upon the unanimous recommendation of the Executive Development and Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant.

The employment offer letter provides for the following terms, effective April 1, 2020:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Mr. Lynch’s annual base salary is to be set at $925,000.

Mr. Lynch is to receive a 2020 target award under the Annual Performance Plan (the “APP”) as President and Chief Executive Officer. His target
award opportunity is to be set at 100% of his annual base salary, which will be prorated to reflect the portions of the year he serves as Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer and will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer. His performance goals to be used to determine the
corporate performance factor with respect to his 2020 APP award will be the same as those in his 2019 APP award.

Mr. Lynch was granted LTPP awards under the Company’s 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms of the Company’s 2020
Long-Term Performance Plan (“LTPP”). In addition to standard LTPP awards granted to him on February 11, 2020 in his role as Executive Vice
President  and  Chief  Operating  Officer  (which  were  based  on  his  current  target  award  opportunity  percentage  of  165%  and  annual  base  salary  of
approximately  $634,000),  he  was  granted  additional  LTPP  awards  effective  April  1, 2020  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  fair  value  of  LTPP
grants he would be eligible to receive as President and Chief Executive Officer as of April 1, 2020 based on a target award opportunity of 275% and
his  then  annual  base  salary,  and  the  fair  value  of  the  February  11,  2020  LTPP  grants.  The  April  1,  2020  LTPP  awards  have  standard  terms  and
vesting conditions substantially similar to those granted to Mr. Lynch in February 2020. All of Mr. Lynch’s 2020 LTPP awards will include the post-
retirement continued vesting provisions applicable to the Company’s executives serving in the CEO, CFO and COO roles.

Mr. Lynch will continue to participate in the Company’s Executive Severance Policy. Under this policy, in the event Mr. Lynch’s employment as
President and Chief Executive Officer is terminated by the Company without cause (as determined by the Board of Directors), he would be eligible to
receive salary continuation and COBRA benefits, and would continue to participate in any Company-sponsored life insurance plan, for a period of 18
months following the date of termination. In that circumstance, he also would receive a pro rata APP award for the year in which the termination of
employment occurs, to the extent such payment is provided for under the terms of the applicable APP award.

Mr. Lynch will continue to be eligible to receive benefits as provided under the Company’s qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans,
as they may be in effect from time to time.

Mr.  Lynch will  continue  to  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  Company’s employee  nonqualified  deferred  compensation  plan and  its 401(k)  savings
plan.

Mr. Lynch will continue to be subject to the Company’s executive stock ownership guidelines. Beginning April 1, 2020, he will be required to own
common stock with a value of at least six times his annual base salary.

Election of Mr. Lynch to the Board

On February 12, 2020, the Board unanimously approved the election of Mr. Lynch, effective April 1, 2020, to fill the vacancy to be created when Ms. Story
retires and steps down from the Board. Mr. Lynch will serve a term to commence April 1, 2020 and ending on the date of the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”), and until his successor has been elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. Mr. Lynch will not
serve on any committees of the Board. On that same day, the Board nominated Mr. Lynch, effective April 1, 2020, as a nominee for election as a director at the
Annual Meeting, to serve a term commencing on the date of the Annual Meeting and ending on the date of the Company’s 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders,
and until his successor has been elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal.

Other than as part of or in connection with the compensatory and other arrangements with Mr. Lynch described above, in connection with his election to the
Board, (i) there are no other arrangements or understandings between Mr. Lynch and any other person, pursuant to which Mr. Lynch was selected as a director, (ii)
no material plan, contract or arrangement has been entered into with Mr. Lynch, and no such plan, contract or arrangement with Mr. Lynch has been materially
amended, and (iii) no grant of any award to Mr. Lynch or modification of an existing award has been made. Also, Mr. Lynch does not have any direct or indirect
material interest in any transaction that would require reporting under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC.’S EQUITY SECURITIES

The following description of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), is not intended to be complete. For more
information  regarding  the  Common  Stock,  please  refer  to  the  Company’s  Restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation  (the  “Certificate  of  Incorporation”),  and  the
Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), which have been filed as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following descriptions are based on the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect as of February 18, 2020.
The terms and provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are hereby incorporated by reference herein. The terms of these securities also may be
affected by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”).

General

The Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of February 13,

2020, there were 180,974,719 shares of Common Stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

Common Stock

Voting Rights

Other  than  with  respect  to  director  elections,  except  as  otherwise  required  by  law,  all  matters  to  be  voted  on  by  the  Company’s  shareholders  must  be
approved by a majority of the shares present in person or proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. With respect to uncontested director
elections, the Bylaws require that in order to be elected, a director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast (for this purpose, a majority of the votes cast
means that the number of shares voted “for” a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that nominee). For contested director elections
where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the Bylaws require that the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the
shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

Dividends

Holders  of  Common  Stock  will  share  equally  in  any  dividend  declared  by  the  Company’s  board  of  directors  (the  “Board”),  subject  to  the  rights  of  the

holders of any outstanding preferred stock.

Liquidation Rights

In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company’s affairs, holders of Common Stock would be entitled,
after payment of the liquidation preference to all holders of any outstanding preferred stock, to share ratably in the Company’s assets that are legally available for
distribution to shareholders after payment of liabilities. The Company must pay the applicable distribution to any holders of its preferred stock before it may pay
distributions to the holders of Common Stock.

Other Rights

The Company’s shareholders have no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for additional shares.

Preferred Stock

The  Board  may  authorize  the  issuance  of  preferred  stock  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  series,  without  shareholder  approval.  Subject  to  the  limits
imposed  by  the  DGCL,  the  Board  is  authorized  to  fix  for  any  series  of  preferred  stock  the  number  of  shares  of  such  series  and  the  voting  powers  (if  any),
designation, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such series. The Board is also
authorized to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote
or action by the Company’s shareholders.

The Board may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that affect adversely the voting power or other rights of holders of
Common Stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the
effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, causing the market price of a share of Common Stock to decline, or impairing the voting and other
rights of the holders of Common Stock.

Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the DGCL

The following provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, even if

doing so would benefit the Company’s shareholders.

Undesignated Preferred Stock

The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for the Board to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with super voting, special
approval, dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire the Company. These and other
provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of the Company.

Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Meetings, Nominations and Proposals

The Bylaws provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called only upon the request of the majority of the members of the Board, upon request of
the Chairman of the Board, or by the Secretary of the Company upon request of shareholders holding at least 15% of the outstanding Common Stock. The Bylaws
prohibit the conduct of any business at a special meeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting.

The Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election as
directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof. A shareholder who wishes to bring a matter before a meeting
must  comply  with  the  Company’s  advance  notice  requirements  and  provide  the  Company  with  certain  information.  Additionally,  vacancies  and  newly  created
directorships may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, even though less than a quorum, or by shareholders. These
provisions may defer, delay or discourage a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise
attempting to obtain control of the Company.

Shareholder Action by Written Consent

As  permitted  by  Section  228  of  the  DGCL,  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  states  that  any  action  required  or  permitted  to  be  taken  by  the  Company’s

shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and may not be effected by consent in writing by such shareholders.

Certain Anti-Takeover Matters

A significant number of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are subject to economic regulation by state public utility commissions. Some of these states
have enacted laws that require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of any regulated utility. In those states, obtaining “control” of the parent or any
other company that controls a regulated utility also requires prior regulatory approval. The threshold for a change in control is a fact-specific inquiry that varies by
state. For example, in some states, a presumption of control will arise when an acquiring party acquires more than 9.9% of the voting securities of the regulated
utility or the controlling entity. In addition to ownership, other states may analyze the degree of influence or control an acquiror may exert over the company. Any
person acquiring Common Stock in an offering or in any other purchase of Common Stock in an amount sufficient to trigger a change in control under state law
would need the prior approval of the applicable state public utility commission.

Certain Other Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the DGCL

Board of Directors

The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the number of directors is fixed in the manner provided in the Bylaws. The Bylaws provide that the number of

directors will be fixed from time to time by the Board.

Business Combinations under Delaware Law

The Company is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with
an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the time the shareholder became an “interested stockholder,” subject to certain exceptions, including if,
prior  to  such  time,  the  board  of  directors  approved  the  business  combination  or  the  transaction  which  resulted  in  the  shareholder  becoming  an  “interested
stockholder.” “Business combinations” include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the “interested stockholder.” Subject to
various exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns, or within the prior three years did own,
15% or more of

the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. These restrictions  generally prohibit or delay the accomplishment  of mergers or other takeover or change-in-control
attempts that are not approved by a company’s board of directors.

Limitations of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers

The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for
breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties. The Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages
for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. The DGCL does not permit exculpation for liability:

•
•
•
•

for breach of the duty of loyalty;
for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law;
under Section 174 of the DGCL (relating to unlawful dividends or stock repurchases); or
for transactions from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. The
Bylaws also expressly authorize the Company to carry directors’ and officers’ insurance providing indemnification for its directors, officers and certain employees
and agents for certain liabilities.

The  limitation  of  liability  and  indemnification  provisions  in  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  and  Bylaws  may  discourage  shareholders  from  bringing  a
lawsuit  against  the  Company’s  directors  for  breach  of  their  fiduciary  duty.  These  provisions  may  also  have  the  effect  of  reducing  the  likelihood  of  derivative
litigation against the Company’s directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and its shareholders. In
addition,  an  investment  in  the  Common  Stock  may  be  adversely  affected  to  the  extent  the  Company  pays  the  costs  of  settlement  and  damage  awards  against
directors and officers in accordance with these indemnification provisions.

Transfer Agent and Registrar

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC serves as the registrar and transfer agent for the Common Stock.

New York Stock Exchange Listing

The Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “AWK.”

Exhibit 10.14.33

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC.
2017 OMNIBUS EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN
PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT GRANT

This  PERFORMANCE  STOCK  UNIT  GRANT,  dated  as  of  February  14,  2019  (the  “Date  of  Grant”),  is  delivered  by

American Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company”) to _________ ________________ (the “Participant”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Committee (as defined in the American Water Works Company, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation
Plan (the “Plan”)) has adopted a 2019 Long Term Performance Plan (“2019 LTPP”) pursuant to which designated employees will be
granted equity awards (collectively, the “Equity Award”) for shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share
(the “Company Stock”);

WHEREAS, the Equity Award is comprised of three separate grants: a restricted stock unit and two performance stock unit

grants;

WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that the Participant is eligible to participate in the 2019 LTPP and to grant the

Participant an Equity Award under the 2019 LTPP; and

WHEREAS,  the  Committee  has  determined  that  the  performance  stock  unit  portion  of  the  Equity  Award  granted  to  the
Participant pursuant to the 2019 LTPP shall be issued under the Plan, and the terms and conditions of the performance stock unit
grant that may be earned based on Performance  Goals (defined  below) relating  to compounded  earnings  per share, as set forth in
Exhibit A attached hereto, shall be memorialized in this grant (the “Grant”).

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Grant, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1.
Grant of Performance Stock Units. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Grant and the Plan, the Company
hereby grants to the Participant ______ performance stock units (the “Performance Units”). The Performance Units are contingently
awarded and will be earned and distributable if and only to the extent that the Performance Goals and other conditions set forth in
this Grant are met. Each Performance Unit shall be a phantom right and shall be equivalent to one share of Company Stock on the
applicable payment date, as described in Paragraph 5 below. The number of Performance Units set forth above is equal to the target
number of shares of Company Stock that the Participant will earn for 100% achievement of the Performance Goals described in this
Grant (the “Target Award”).

2.    Performance Unit Account. The Company shall establish and maintain a Performance Unit account as a bookkeeping account on
its records (the “Performance Unit Account”) for the Participant and shall record in such Performance Unit Account the number of
Performance Units

1

granted to the Participant. The Participant shall not have any interest in any fund or specific assets of the Company by reason of this
grant or the Performance Unit Account established for the Participant.

3.    Performance Goals.

(a)    Unless a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period (as defined below), the
distribution  of  the  shares  of  Company  Stock  attributable  to  the  Performance  Units  is  contingent  upon  achievement  of  the
performance goals set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Performance Goals”) and the Participant satisfying the continuation of
employment and service with the Employer (as defined in the Plan) requirement described in Paragraph 4 below.

(b)        As  soon  as  administratively  practicable  following  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period  (as  defined  in  Paragraph  3(d)
below),  the  Committee  will  determine  whether  and  to  what  extent  the  Performance  Goals  have  been  met  and  the  number  of
Performance Units the Participant has earned, if any. Except as described in Paragraph 4 below, the Participant must be employed
by, or providing service to, the Employer on the last day of the Performance Period in order to earn the Performance Units.

(c)    If a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Company is not the surviving corporation
(or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation or entity (the “surviving corporation”)) and the Performance Units are not
converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), then the Performance
Period will end on the date of the Change of Control and the Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as
of the date of the Change of Control (the “Change of Control Date”). In the event the Participant’s Performance Units are assumed
by the surviving corporation but the Participant ceases to be employed by, or providing service to, the surviving corporation (or a
parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation) within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change of Control on account of (i)
a termination of such Participant’s employment by the surviving corporation (or a parent of subsidiary of the surviving corporation)
for any reason other than on account of Cause (as defined in paragraph 4(c) hereof), or on account of death or Disability (each as
defined in the Plan), or (ii) a termination of employment or service by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Plan), then
the  Performance  Period  will  end  on  the  date  of  such  termination  of  employment  or  service  (the  “Termination  Date”)  and  the
Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as of the Termination Date. For purposes of this Grant, “Change
of Control” shall mean as such term is defined in the Plan, except that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of this Grant unless the event constituting the Change of Control constitutes a change in ownership or effective control of
the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, within the meaning of section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and its corresponding regulations.

(d)    For purposes of this Grant, the term “Performance Period” shall mean the three (3)-year period beginning on January 1,

2019 and ending December 31, 2021.

4.    Termination of Employment or Service.

(a)    Except as set forth in Paragraph 3(c), if, at least one year after the beginning of the Performance Period, but prior to the
end  of  the  Performance  Period,  the  Participant  ceases  to  be  employed  by,  or  provide  service  to,  the  Employer  on  account  of  any
reason other than a termination for Cause (as defined below), the Participant will earn a pro-rata portion of the Performance Units, if
the Performance Goals and the requirements of this Grant are met as of the last day of the Performance Period. The pro-rata portion
earned  will  be  equal  to  the  number  of  Performance  Units  that  would  have  been  earned  if  the  Participant  had  remained  employed
through the last day of the Performance Period, multiplied by a fraction, which fraction shall be equal to (i) 1/3, if the Participant’s
employment  or  service  with  the  Employer  terminates  on  or  after  January  31,  2020,  but  prior  to  January  31,  2021;  (ii)  2/3,  if  the
Participant’s employment or service with the Employer terminates on or after January 31, 2021, but prior to January 31, 2022; and
(iii)  3/3,  if  the  Participant’s  employment  or  service  terminates  with  the  Employer  on  or  after  January  31,  2022.  If  the  Participant
ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer for any reason other than on account of Cause, the prorated number of
Performance Units earned by the Participant pursuant to this Paragraph 4(a) will be distributed in accordance with Paragraph 5.

(b)    If at any time prior to the earlier of January 31, 2020 or a Change of Control, the Participant’s employment or service
with the Employer is terminated by the Employer on account of any reason or no reason or by the Participant for any reason or no
reason, all of the Performance Units subject to this Grant shall be immediately forfeited as of the date of the Participant’s termination
of  employment  or  service  with  the  Employer  and  the  Participant  shall  not  have  any  rights  with  respect  to  the  distribution  of  any
portion of the Performance Units.

(c)    If at any time prior to the date the Performance Units are distributed in accordance with Paragraph 5 the Participant’s
employment or service with the Employer is terminated on account of Cause, all of the Performance Units subject to this Grant shall
be  immediately  forfeited  and  the  Participant  will  not  have  any  rights  with  respect  to  the  distribution  of  any  portion  of  the
Performance  Units,  irrespective  of  the  level  of  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goals.  For  purposes  of  this  Grant,  “Cause” shall
mean a finding by the Committee that the Participant (i) has breached his or her employment or service contract with the Employer,
if  any;  (ii)  has  engaged  in  disloyalty  to  the  Employer,  including,  without  limitation,  fraud,  embezzlement,  theft,  commission  of  a
felony or proven dishonesty; (iii) has disclosed trade secrets or confidential information of the Employer to persons not entitled to
receive such information; (iv) has breached any written noncompetition or non-solicitation agreement between the Participant and
the Employer; or (v) has engaged in such other behavior detrimental to the interests of the Employer as the Committee determines.

5.    Time and Form of Payment with Respect to Performance Units. Unless an election is made pursuant to Paragraph 6 below, the
Participant will receive a distribution with respect to the Performance Units earned as described in Paragraphs 3 and 4 above within
seventy (70) days following the earliest of (a) January 31, 2022 (the “Distribution Date”), (b) the Change of Control Date, or (c) the
Termination  Date.  The  Performance  Units  will  be  distributed  in  shares  of  Company  Stock,  with  each  Performance  Unit  earned
equivalent to one share of Company Stock. Any

3

Performance  Units  not  earned  because  of  the  failure  to  attain  the  Performance  Goals  and  service  condition  will  be  immediately
forfeited.

6.    Deferrals. The Participant may make an irrevocable election to defer the Distribution Date (or further defer the Deferred Date (as
defined below), if applicable) of all of the Performance Units that are earned, plus dividend equivalents earned on such Performance
Units  as  described  in  Paragraph  7  below,  to  a  later  date,  provided  that  (a)  the  election  shall  not  take  effect  until  at  least  twelve
(12) months after the date on which the election is made, (b) the deferred Distribution Date cannot be earlier than five (5) years from
the original Distribution Date under Paragraph 5 above (or five (5) years from the applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral
of  a  Deferred  Date  is  being  made),  and  (c)  the  election  must  be  made  no  less  than  twelve  (12)  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
Distribution Date (twelve (12) months prior to the previously applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral of a Deferred Date is
being  made).  To  defer  the  Distribution  Date,  the  Participant  must  elect  to  defer  100%  of  the  Performance  Units,  including
corresponding  dividend  equivalents,  earned  by  the  Participant  under  this  Grant,  as  well  as  100%  of  the  other  performance  stock
units, including corresponding dividend equivalents, earned by the Participant under the 2019 LTPP, complete the deferral election
form  provided  to  the  Participant  by  the  Committee,  and  return  such  form  to  the  Company  in  the  manner  and  by  the  deadline
provided  therein.  If the Participant  desires  to make  a further  deferral,  the Participant  must make  such  election  on a separate  form
provided by the Committee for such purpose. Any such election shall be made in accordance with section 409A of the Code and any
corresponding guidance and regulations issued under section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding a Participant’s election pursuant to
this  Paragraph,  if  the  Change  of  Control  Date  or  the  Termination  Date  occurs  prior  to  the  Deferred  Date,  the  distribution  of  the
Participant’s  earned  Performance  Units,  plus  corresponding  dividend,  equivalents  will  be  the  Change  of  Control  Date  or  the
Termination  Date,  as  applicable.  If  a  Distribution  Date  is  delayed  one  or  more  times  pursuant  to  this  Paragraph  6,  the  new
Distribution Date shall be referred to as the “Deferred Date.”

7.    Dividend Equivalents. Until the earlier of the Distribution Date (or the Deferred Date, if elected), the Change of Control Date or
the Termination Date, if any dividends are paid with respect to the shares of Company Stock, the Company shall credit to a dividend
equivalent  account  (the  “Dividend  Equivalent  Account”)  the  value  of  the  dividends  that  would  have  been  distributed  if  the
Performance  Units  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Performance  Unit  Account  as  of  the  date  of  payment  of  any  such  dividend  were
shares of Company Stock. At the same time that the Performance Units are converted to shares of Company Stock and distributed to
the  Participant,  the  Company  shall  pay  to  the  Participant  in  a  lump  sum  cash  equal  to  the  value  of  the  dividends  credited  to  the
Participant’s Dividend Equivalent Account; provided, however, that any dividends that were credited to the Participant’s Dividend
Equivalent Account that are attributable to Performance Units that have been forfeited as provided in Paragraph 3 and 4 above shall
be  forfeited  and  not  payable  to  the  Participant.  No  interest  shall  accrue  on  any  dividend  equivalents  credited  to  the  Participant’s
Dividend Equivalent Account.

8.    Change of Control. Except as set forth above, the provisions set forth in the Plan applicable to a Change of Control (as defined in
the Plan) shall apply to the Performance Units, and, in the event of a Change of Control, the Committee may take such actions as it
deems appropriate pursuant to the Plan and is consistent with the requirements of section 409A of the Code.

“PSU GRANT B – EPS”

EXHIBIT A

PERFORMANCE GOALS

The number of Performance Units that may be earned shall be determined based on the achievement of Compounded Earnings Per
Share Growth (as described below) over the Performance Period.

Compounded  Earnings  Per  Share  (“EPS”)  Growth –  will  be  calculated  based  on  fully  diluted  EPS  calculated  in  accordance  with
US  GAAP  as  reported  in  the  Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  adjusted  to  exclude  all  items  of  gain,  loss  or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The ending point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature.

The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:

Compounded EPS Growth

Actual
Compounded EPS
Growth

11.0% or more

9.8%

8.5%

7.3%

< 6.0%

Target Award
200%

175%

100%

25%

0%

If  actual  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goal  does  not  meet  threshold  performance  (i.e.,  less  than  6.0%  for  Compounded  EPS
Growth, then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units at
its assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at 200%, and the
maximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.

Example:

The following is an example calculation for a Participant with a Target Award of 1,000 Performance Units:

Earnings Per Share

In this example, the individual who was awarded a Target Grant of 1,000 Performance Units would earn 1,275 Performance Units
(1,000 x 1.275), which is convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock assuming all other terms and conditions
of the Grant have been satisfied.

This  PERFORMANCE  STOCK  UNIT  GRANT,  dated  as  of  February  14,  2019  (the  “Date  of  Grant”),  is  delivered  by

American Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company”) to _________________ (the “Participant”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Committee (as defined in the American Water Works Company, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation
Plan (the “Plan”)) has adopted a 2019 Long Term Performance Plan (“2019 LTPP”) pursuant to which designated employees will be
granted equity awards (collectively, the “Equity Award”) for shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share
(the “Company Stock”);

WHEREAS, the Equity Award is comprised of three separate grants: a restricted stock unit and two performance stock unit

grants;

WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that the Participant is eligible to participate in the 2019 LTPP and to grant the

Participant an Equity Award under the 2019 LTPP; and

WHEREAS,  the  Committee  has  determined  that  the  performance  stock  unit  portion  of  the  Equity  Award  granted  to  the
Participant pursuant to the 2019 LTPP shall be issued under the Plan, and the terms and conditions of the performance stock unit
grant that may be earned based on Performance  Goals (defined  below) relating  to compounded  earnings  per share, as set forth in
Exhibit A attached hereto, shall be memorialized in this grant (the “Grant”).

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Grant, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1.
Grant of Performance Stock Units. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Grant and the Plan, the Company
hereby grants to the Participant ______ performance stock units (the “Performance Units”). The Performance Units are contingently
awarded and will be earned and distributable if and only to the extent that the Performance Goals and other conditions set forth in
this Grant are met. Each Performance Unit shall be a phantom right and shall be equivalent to one share of Company Stock on the
applicable payment date, as described in Paragraph 5 below. The number of Performance Units set forth above is equal to the target
number of shares of Company Stock that the Participant will earn for 100% achievement of the Performance Goals described in this
Grant (the “Target Award”).

2.    Performance Unit Account. The Company shall establish and maintain a Performance Unit account as a bookkeeping account on
its records (the “Performance Unit Account”) for the Participant and shall record in such Performance Unit Account the number of
Performance Units

granted to the Participant. The Participant shall not have any interest in any fund or specific assets of the Company by reason of this
grant or the Performance Unit Account established for the Participant.

3.    Performance Goals.

(a)    Unless a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period (as defined below), the
distribution  of  the  shares  of  Company  Stock  attributable  to  the  Performance  Units  is  contingent  upon  achievement  of  the
performance goals set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Performance Goals”) and the Participant satisfying the continuation of
employment and service with the Employer (as defined in the Plan) requirement described in Paragraph 4 below.

(b)        As  soon  as  administratively  practicable  following  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period  (as  defined  in  Paragraph  3(d)
below),  the  Committee  will  determine  whether  and  to  what  extent  the  Performance  Goals  have  been  met  and  the  number  of
Performance Units the Participant has earned, if any. Except as described in Paragraph 4 below, the Participant must be employed
by, or providing service to, the Employer on the last day of the Performance Period in order to earn the Performance Units.

(c)    If a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Company is not the surviving corporation
(or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation or entity (the “surviving corporation”)) and the Performance Units are not
converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), then the Performance
Period will end on the date of the Change of Control and the Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as
of the date of the Change of Control (the “Change of Control Date”). In the event the Participant’s Performance Units are assumed
by the surviving corporation but the Participant ceases to be employed by, or providing service to, the surviving corporation (or a
parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation) within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change of Control on account of (i)
a termination of such Participant’s employment by the surviving corporation (or a parent of subsidiary of the surviving corporation)
for any reason other than on account of Cause (as defined in Paragraph 4(e) hereof), or on account of death or Disability (each as
defined in the Plan), or (ii) a termination of employment or service by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Plan), then
the  Performance  Period  will  end  on  the  date  of  such  termination  of  employment  or  service  (the  “Termination  Date”)  and  the
Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as of the Termination Date. For purposes of this Grant, “Change
of Control” shall mean as such term is defined in the Plan, except that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of this Grant unless the event constituting the Change of Control constitutes a change in ownership or effective control of
the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, within the meaning of section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and its corresponding regulations.

(d)    For purposes of this Grant, the term “Performance Period” shall mean the three (3)-year period beginning on January 1,

2019 and ending December 31, 2021.

2

4.    Termination of Employment or Service.

(a)    Except as set forth in Paragraphs 3(c), 4(b) or 4(c), if, at least one year after the beginning of the Performance Period,
but  prior  to  the  end  of the  Performance  Period,  the  Participant  ceases  to  be  employed  by,  or provide  service  to,  the  Employer  on
account  of  any  reason  other  than  a  termination  for  Cause  (as  defined  below),  the  Participant  will  earn  a  pro-rata  portion  of  the
Performance Units, if the Performance Goals and the requirements of this Grant are met as of the last day of the Performance Period.
The pro-rata portion earned will be equal to the number of Performance Units that would have been earned if the Participant had
remained employed through the last day of the Performance Period, multiplied by a fraction, which fraction shall be equal to (i) 1/3,
if the Participant’s employment or service with the Employer terminates on or after January 31, 2020, but prior to January 31, 2021;
(ii) 2/3, if the Participant’s employment or service with the Employer terminates on or after January 31, 2021, but prior to January
31, 2022; and (iii) 3/3, if the Participant’s employment or service terminates with the Employer on or after January 31, 2022. If the
Participant  ceases  to  be  employed  by,  or  provide  service  to,  the  Employer  for  any  reason  other  than  on  account  of  Cause,  the
prorated  number of Performance  Units earned by the Participant  pursuant to this Paragraph  4(a) will be distributed  in accordance
with Paragraph 5.

(b)       Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  if  prior  to  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period,  the
Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer on account of Normal Retirement, then the Participant will
earn the number of Performance Units that would have been earned if the Participant has remained employed through the last day of
the Performance Period, if the Performance Goals and the requirements of this Grant are met as of the last day of the Performance
Period. If the Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer on account of Normal Retirement pursuant
to this subparagraph (b), the number of Performance Units that are earned based on the Performance Goals and other requirements of
this  Grant  will  be  distributed  in  accordance  with  Paragraph  5.  For  purposes  of  this  Grant,  “Normal  Retirement”  shall  mean
termination of employment or service with the Employer (other than for Cause) after the Participant has attained age sixty (60) and
has five (5) total years of employment or service with the Employer which includes at least three (3) consecutive full calendar years
of service in the position of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or any combination thereof.

(c)        Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  if  prior  to  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period,  the
Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer on account of Early Retirement, then the Participant will
earn 75% of the number of Performance Units that would have been earned if the Participant had remained employed through the
last day of the Performance  Period,  if the Performance  Goals and the requirements  of this Grant are met as of the last day of the
Performance Period, and unearned Performance Units shall be immediately forfeited. If the Participant ceases to be employed by, or
provide service to, the Employer on account of Early Retirement pursuant to this subparagraph (c), then the number of Performance
Units that are earned based on the Performance Goals and other requirements of this Grant will be distributed in accordance with
Paragraph 5. For purposes of this Grant, “Early Retirement” shall mean termination of employment or service with the Employer
(other than for Cause) after the Participant has attained age fifty-five (55) and has five (5) total years of employment

3

or  service  with  the  Employer  which  includes  at  least  three  (3)  consecutive  full  calendar  years  of  service  in  the  position  of  Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or any combination thereof.

(d)       Except as set forth in Paragraphs  4(b) or 4(c), if at any time prior to the earlier of January 31, 2020 or a Change of
Control, the Participant’s employment or service with the Employer is terminated by the Employer on account of any reason or no
reason  or  by  the  Participant  for  any  reason  or  no  reason,  all  of  the  Performance  Units  subject  to  this  Grant  shall  be  immediately
forfeited  as of  the  date  of  the  Participant’s  termination  of  employment  or  service  with  the  Employer  and  the  Participant  shall  not
have any rights with respect to the distribution of any portion of the Performance Units.

(e)    If at any time prior to the date the Performance Units are distributed in accordance with Paragraph 5 the Participant’s
employment or service with the Employer is terminated on account of Cause, all of the Performance Units subject to this Grant shall
be  immediately  forfeited  and  the  Participant  will  not  have  any  rights  with  respect  to  the  distribution  of  any  portion  of  the
Performance  Units,  irrespective  of  the  level  of  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goals.  For  purposes  of  this  Grant,  “Cause” shall
mean a finding by the Committee that the Participant (i) has breached his or her employment or service contract with the Employer,
if  any;  (ii)  has  engaged  in  disloyalty  to  the  Employer,  including,  without  limitation,  fraud,  embezzlement,  theft,  commission  of  a
felony or proven dishonesty; (iii) has disclosed trade secrets or confidential information of the Employer to persons not entitled to
receive such information; (iv) has breached any written noncompetition or non-solicitation agreement between the Participant and
the Employer; or (v) has engaged in such other behavior detrimental to the interests of the Employer as the Committee determines.

5.    Time and Form of Payment with Respect to Performance Units. Unless an election is made pursuant to Paragraph 6 below, the
Participant will receive a distribution with respect to the Performance Units earned as described in Paragraphs 3 and 4 above within
seventy (70) days following the earliest of (a) January 31, 2022 (the “Distribution Date”), (b) the Change of Control Date, or (c) the
Termination  Date.  The  Performance  Units  will  be  distributed  in  shares  of  Company  Stock,  with  each  Performance  Unit  earned
equivalent to one share of Company Stock. Any Performance Units not earned because of the failure to attain the Performance Goals
and service condition will be immediately forfeited.

6.    Deferrals. The Participant may make an irrevocable election to defer the Distribution Date (or further defer the Deferred Date (as
defined below), if applicable) of all of the Performance Units that are earned, plus dividend equivalents earned on such Performance
Units  as  described  in  Paragraph  7  below,  to  a  later  date,  provided  that  (a)  the  election  shall  not  take  effect  until  at  least  twelve
(12) months after the date on which the election is made, (b) the deferred Distribution Date cannot be earlier than five (5) years from
the original Distribution Date under Paragraph 5 above (or five (5) years from the applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral
of  a  Deferred  Date  is  being  made),  and  (c)  the  election  must  be  made  no  less  than  twelve  (12)  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
Distribution Date (twelve (12) months prior to the previously applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral of a Deferred Date is
being  made).  To  defer  the  Distribution  Date,  the  Participant  must  elect  to  defer  100%  of  the  Performance  Units,  including
corresponding dividend equivalents,

4

earned by the Participant under this Grant, as well as 100% of the other performance stock units, including corresponding dividend
equivalents, earned by the Participant under the 2019 LTPP, complete the deferral election form provided to the Participant by the
Committee, and return such form to the Company in the manner and by the deadline provided therein. If the Participant desires to
make a further deferral, the Participant must make such election on a separate form provided by the Committee for such purpose.
Any  such  election  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  section  409A  of  the  Code  and  any  corresponding  guidance  and  regulations
issued under section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding a Participant’s election pursuant to this Paragraph, if the Change of Control
Date or the Termination Date occurs prior to the Deferred Date, the distribution of the Participant’s earned Performance Units, plus
corresponding  dividend  equivalents,  will  be  the  Change  of  Control  Date  or  the  Termination  Date,  as  applicable.  If  a  Distribution
Date  is  delayed  one  or  more  times  pursuant  to  this  Paragraph  6,  the  new  Distribution  Date  shall  be  referred  to  as  the  “Deferred
Date.”

7.    Dividend Equivalents. Until the earlier of the Distribution Date (or the Deferred Date, if elected), the Change of Control Date or
the Termination Date, if any dividends are paid with respect to the shares of Company Stock, the Company shall credit to a dividend
equivalent  account  (the  “Dividend  Equivalent  Account”)  the  value  of  the  dividends  that  would  have  been  distributed  if  the
Performance  Units  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Performance  Unit  Account  as  of  the  date  of  payment  of  any  such  dividend  were
shares of Company Stock. At the same time that the Performance Units are converted to shares of Company Stock and distributed to
the  Participant,  the  Company  shall  pay  to  the  Participant  in  a  lump  sum  cash  equal  to  the  value  of  the  dividends  credited  to  the
Participant’s Dividend Equivalent Account; provided, however, that any dividends that were credited to the Participant’s Dividend
Equivalent Account that are attributable to Performance Units that have been forfeited as provided in Paragraph 3 and 4 above shall
be  forfeited  and  not  payable  to  the  Participant.  No  interest  shall  accrue  on  any  dividend  equivalents  credited  to  the  Participant’s
Dividend Equivalent Account.

8.    Change of Control. Except as set forth above, the provisions set forth in the Plan applicable to a Change of Control (as defined in
the Plan) shall apply to the Performance Units, and, in the event of a Change of Control, the Committee may take such actions as it
deems appropriate pursuant to the Plan and is consistent with the requirements of section 409A of the Code.

9.        Acknowledgment  by  Participant.  By  accepting  this  Grant,  the  Participant  acknowledges  that,  with  respect  to  any  right  to
distribution pursuant to the Plan or this Grant, the Participant is and shall be an unsecured general creditor of the Company without
any  preference  as  against  other  unsecured  general  creditors  of  the  Company,  and  the  Participant  hereby  covenants  for  himself  or
herself, and anyone at any time claiming through or under the Participant, not to claim any such preference, and hereby disclaims
and waives any such preference which may at any time be at issue, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

amended, and that any consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body that is necessary to issue shares of Company Stock

“PSU GRANT B – EPS”

EXHIBIT A

PERFORMANCE GOALS

The number of Performance Units that may be earned shall be determined based on the achievement of Compounded Earnings Per
Share Growth (as described below) over the Performance Period.

Compounded  Earnings  Per  Share  (“EPS”)  Growth –  will  be  calculated  based  on  fully  diluted  EPS  calculated  in  accordance  with
US  GAAP  as  reported  in  the  Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  adjusted  to  exclude  all  items  of  gain,  loss  or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The ending point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature.

The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:

Compounded EPS Growth

Actual
Compounded EPS
Growth

11.0% or more

9.8%

8.5%

7.3%

< 6.0%

Target Award
200%

175%

100%

25%

0%

If  actual  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goal  does  not  meet  threshold  performance  (i.e.,  less  than  6.0%  for  Compounded  EPS
Growth, then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units at
its assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at 200%, and the
maximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.

Example:

The following is an example calculation for a Participant with a Target Award of 1,000 Performance Units:

PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT GRANT

This  PERFORMANCE  STOCK  UNIT  GRANT,  dated  as  of  February  14,  2019  (the  “Date  of  Grant”),  is  delivered  by

American Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company”) to Loyd A. Warnock (the “Participant”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Committee (as defined in the American Water Works Company, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation
Plan (the “Plan”)) has adopted a 2019 Long Term Performance Plan (“2019 LTPP”) pursuant to which designated employees will be
granted equity awards (collectively, the “Equity Award”) for shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share
(the “Company Stock”);

WHEREAS, the Equity Award is comprised of three separate grants: a restricted stock unit and two performance stock unit

grants;

WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that the Participant is eligible to participate in the 2019 LTPP and to grant the

Participant an Equity Award under the 2019 LTPP; and

WHEREAS,  the  Committee  has  determined  that  the  performance  stock  unit  portion  of  the  Equity  Award  granted  to  the
Participant pursuant to the 2019 LTPP shall be issued under the Plan, and the terms and conditions of the performance stock unit
grant that may be earned based on Performance  Goals (defined  below) relating  to compounded  earnings  per share, as set forth in
Exhibit A attached hereto, shall be memorialized in this grant (the “Grant”).

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Grant, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1.
Grant of Performance Stock Units. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Grant and the Plan, the Company
hereby grants to the Participant 1,602 performance stock units (the “Performance Units”). The Performance Units are contingently
awarded and will be earned and distributable if and only to the extent that the Performance Goals and other conditions set forth in
this Grant are met. Each Performance Unit shall be a phantom right and shall be equivalent to one share of Company Stock on the
applicable payment date, as described in Paragraph 5 below. The number of Performance Units set forth above is equal to the target
number of shares of Company Stock that the Participant will earn for 100% achievement of the Performance Goals described in this
Grant (the “Target Award”).

2.    Performance Unit Account. The Company shall establish and maintain a Performance Unit account as a bookkeeping account on
its records (the “Performance Unit Account”) for the Participant and shall record in such Performance Unit Account the number of
Performance Units

1

granted to the Participant. The Participant shall not have any interest in any fund or specific assets of the Company by reason of this
grant or the Performance Unit Account established for the Participant.

3.    Performance Goals.

(a)    Unless a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period (as defined below), the
distribution  of  the  shares  of  Company  Stock  attributable  to  the  Performance  Units  is  contingent  upon  achievement  of  the
performance goals set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Performance Goals”) and the Participant satisfying the continuation of
employment and service with the Employer (as defined in the Plan) requirement described in Paragraph 4 below.

(b)        As  soon  as  administratively  practicable  following  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period  (as  defined  in  Paragraph  3(d)
below),  the  Committee  will  determine  whether  and  to  what  extent  the  Performance  Goals  have  been  met  and  the  number  of
Performance Units the Participant has earned, if any. Except as described in Paragraph 4 below, the Participant must be employed
by, or providing service to, the Employer on the last day of the Performance Period in order to earn the Performance Units.

(c)    If a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Company is not the surviving corporation
(or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation or entity (the “surviving corporation”)) and the Performance Units are not
converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), then the Performance
Period will end on the date of the Change of Control and the Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as
of the date of the Change of Control (the “Change of Control Date”). In the event the Participant’s Performance Units are assumed
by the surviving corporation but the Participant ceases to be employed by, or providing service to, the surviving corporation (or a
parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation) within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change of Control on account of (i)
a termination of such Participant’s employment by the surviving corporation (or a parent of subsidiary of the surviving corporation)
for any reason other than on account of Cause (as defined in paragraph 4(c) hereof), or on account of death or Disability (each as
defined in the Plan), or (ii) a termination of employment or service by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Plan), then
the  Performance  Period  will  end  on  the  date  of  such  termination  of  employment  or  service  (the  “Termination  Date”)  and  the
Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as of the Termination Date. For purposes of this Grant, “Change
of Control” shall mean as such term is defined in the Plan, except that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of this Grant unless the event constituting the Change of Control constitutes a change in ownership or effective control of
the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, within the meaning of section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and its corresponding regulations.

(d)    For purposes of this Grant, the term “Performance Period” shall mean the three (3)-year period beginning on January 1,

2019 and ending December 31, 2021.

2

4.    Termination of Employment or Service.

(a)        Except  as  set  forth  in  Paragraph  3(c),  unless  the  Participant’s  employment  or  service  with  the  Employer  terminates
before  January  1, 2021, the  Participant  will vest in the Performance  Units, if the Performance  Goals  and the requirements  of this
Grant are met as of the last day of the Performance Period. The number of Performance Units earned by the Participant pursuant to
this Paragraph 4(a) will be distributed in accordance with Paragraph 5.

(b)    If at any time prior to the earlier of January 1, 2021 or a Change of Control, the Participant’s employment or service
with the Employer is terminated by the Employer on account of any reason or no reason or by the Participant for any reason or no
reason, all of the Performance Units subject to this Grant shall be immediately forfeited as of the date of the Participant’s termination
of  employment  or  service  with  the  Employer  and  the  Participant  shall  not  have  any  rights  with  respect  to  the  distribution  of  any
portion of the Performance Units.

(c)    If at any time prior to the date the Performance Units are distributed in accordance with Paragraph 5 the Participant’s
employment or service with the Employer is terminated on account of Cause, all of the Performance Units subject to this Grant shall
be  immediately  forfeited  and  the  Participant  will  not  have  any  rights  with  respect  to  the  distribution  of  any  portion  of  the
Performance  Units,  irrespective  of  the  level  of  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goals.  For  purposes  of  this  Grant,  “Cause” shall
mean a finding by the Committee that the Participant (i) has breached his or her employment or service contract with the Employer,
if  any;  (ii)  has  engaged  in  disloyalty  to  the  Employer,  including,  without  limitation,  fraud,  embezzlement,  theft,  commission  of  a
felony or proven dishonesty; (iii) has disclosed trade secrets or confidential information of the Employer to persons not entitled to
receive such information; (iv) has breached any written noncompetition or non-solicitation agreement between the Participant and
the Employer; or (v) has engaged in such other behavior detrimental to the interests of the Employer as the Committee determines.

5.    Time and Form of Payment with Respect to Performance Units. Unless an election is made pursuant to Paragraph 6 below, the
Participant will receive a distribution with respect to the Performance Units earned as described in Paragraphs 3 and 4 above within
seventy (70) days following the earliest of (a) January 1, 2021 (the “Distribution Date”), (b) the Change of Control Date, or (c) the
Termination  Date.  The  Performance  Units  will  be  distributed  in  shares  of  Company  Stock,  with  each  Performance  Unit  earned
equivalent to one share of Company Stock. Any Performance Units not earned because of the failure to attain the Performance Goals
and service condition will be immediately forfeited.

6.    Deferrals. The Participant may make an irrevocable election to defer the Distribution Date (or further defer the Deferred Date (as
defined below), if applicable) of all of the Performance Units that are earned, plus dividend equivalents earned on such Performance
Units  as  described  in  Paragraph  7  below,  to  a  later  date,  provided  that  (a)  the  election  shall  not  take  effect  until  at  least  twelve
(12) months after the date on which the election is made, (b) the deferred Distribution Date cannot be earlier than five (5) years from
the original Distribution Date under Paragraph 5 above (or five (5) years from the applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral
of  a  Deferred  Date  is  being  made),  and  (c)  the  election  must  be  made  no  less  than  twelve  (12)  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
Distribution Date (twelve (12) months prior to the previously applicable Deferred Date, if a

3

subsequent deferral of a Deferred Date is being made). To defer the Distribution Date, the Participant must elect to defer 100% of
the Performance Units, including corresponding dividend equivalents, earned by the Participant under this Grant, as well as 100% of
the other  performance  stock  units,  including  corresponding  dividend  equivalents,  earned  by the  Participant  under  the 2019  LTPP,
complete  the  deferral  election  form  provided  to  the  Participant  by  the  Committee,  and  return  such  form  to  the  Company  in  the
manner and by the deadline provided therein. If the Participant desires to make a further deferral, the Participant must make such
election on a separate form provided by the Committee for such purpose. Any such election shall be made in accordance with section
409A  of  the  Code  and  any  corresponding  guidance  and  regulations  issued  under  section  409A  of  the  Code.  Notwithstanding  a
Participant’s election pursuant to this Paragraph, if the Change of Control Date or the Termination Date occurs prior to the Deferred
Date, the distribution of the Participant’s earned Performance Units, plus corresponding dividend, equivalents will be the Change of
Control Date or the Termination Date, as applicable. If a Distribution Date is delayed one or more times pursuant to this Paragraph
6, the new Distribution Date shall be referred to as the “Deferred Date.”

7.    Dividend Equivalents. Until the earlier of the Distribution Date (or the Deferred Date, if elected), the Change of Control Date or
the Termination Date, if any dividends are paid with respect to the shares of Company Stock, the Company shall credit to a dividend
equivalent  account  (the  “Dividend  Equivalent  Account”)  the  value  of  the  dividends  that  would  have  been  distributed  if  the
Performance  Units  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Performance  Unit  Account  as  of  the  date  of  payment  of  any  such  dividend  were
shares of Company Stock. At the same time that the Performance Units are converted to shares of Company Stock and distributed to
the  Participant,  the  Company  shall  pay  to  the  Participant  in  a  lump  sum  cash  equal  to  the  value  of  the  dividends  credited  to  the
Participant’s Dividend Equivalent Account; provided, however, that any dividends that were credited to the Participant’s Dividend
Equivalent Account that are attributable to Performance Units that have been forfeited as provided in Paragraph 3 and 4 above shall
be  forfeited  and  not  payable  to  the  Participant.  No  interest  shall  accrue  on  any  dividend  equivalents  credited  to  the  Participant’s
Dividend Equivalent Account.

8.    Change of Control. Except as set forth above, the provisions set forth in the Plan applicable to a Change of Control (as defined in
the Plan) shall apply to the Performance Units, and, in the event of a Change of Control, the Committee may take such actions as it
deems appropriate pursuant to the Plan and is consistent with the requirements of section 409A of the Code.

9.        Acknowledgment  by  Participant.  By  accepting  this  Grant,  the  Participant  acknowledges  that,  with  respect  to  any  right  to
distribution pursuant to the Plan or this Grant, the Participant is and shall be an unsecured general creditor of the Company without
any  preference  as  against  other  unsecured  general  creditors  of  the  Company,  and  the  Participant  hereby  covenants  for  himself  or
herself, and anyone at any time claiming through or under the Participant, not to claim any such preference, and hereby disclaims
and waives any such preference which may at any time be at issue, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

“PSU GRANT B – EPS”

EXHIBIT A

PERFORMANCE GOALS

The number of Performance Units that may be earned shall be determined based on the achievement of Compounded Earnings Per
Share Growth (as described below) over the Performance Period.

Compounded  Earnings  Per  Share  (“EPS”)  Growth –  will  be  calculated  based  on  fully  diluted  EPS  calculated  in  accordance  with
US  GAAP  as  reported  in  the  Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  adjusted  to  exclude  all  items  of  gain,  loss  or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The ending point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature.

The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:

Compounded EPS Growth

Actual
Compounded EPS
Growth

11.0% or more

9.8%

8.5%

7.3%

< 6.0%

Target Award
200%

175%

100%

25%

0%

If  actual  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goal  does  not  meet  threshold  performance  (i.e.,  less  than  6.0%  for  Compounded  EPS
Growth, then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units at
its assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at 200%, and the
maximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.

Example:

The following is an example calculation for a Participant with a Target Award of 1,000 Performance Units:

In this example, the individual who was awarded a Target Grant of 1,000 Performance Units would earn 1,275 Performance Units
(1,000 x 1.275), which is convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock assuming all other terms and conditions
of the Grant have been satisfied.

This PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT GRANT, dated as of June 3, 2019 (the “Date of Grant”), is delivered by American

Water Works Company, Inc. (the “Company”) to M. Susan Hardwick (the “Participant”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Committee (as defined in the American Water Works Company, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation
Plan (the “Plan”)) has adopted a 2019 Long Term Performance Plan (“2019 LTPP”) pursuant to which designated employees will be
granted equity awards (collectively, the “Equity Award”) for shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share
(the “Company Stock”);

WHEREAS, the Equity Award is comprised of three separate grants: a restricted stock unit and two performance stock unit

grants;

WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that the Participant is eligible to participate in the 2019 LTPP and to grant the

Participant an Equity Award under the 2019 LTPP; and

WHEREAS, the Committee has determined that the performance stock unit portion
of  the  Equity  Award  granted  to  the  Participant  pursuant  to  the  2019  LTPP  shall  be  issued  under  the  Plan,  and  the  terms  and
conditions  of  the  performance  stock  unit  grant  that  may  be  earned  based  on  Performance  Goals  (defined  below)  relating  to
compounded earnings per share, as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, shall be memorialized in this grant (the “Grant”).

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Grant, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1.
Grant of Performance Stock Units. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Grant and the Plan, the Company
hereby grants to the Participant 1470 performance stock units (the “Performance Units”). The Performance Units are contingently
awarded and will be earned and distributable if and only to the extent that the Performance Goals and other conditions set forth in
this Grant are met. Each Performance Unit shall be a phantom right and shall be equivalent to one share of Company Stock on the
applicable payment date, as described in Paragraph 5 below. The number of Performance Units set forth above is equal to the target
number of shares of Company Stock that the Participant will earn for 100% achievement of the Performance Goals described in this
Grant (the “Target Award”).

2.    Performance Unit Account. The Company shall establish and maintain a Performance Unit account as a bookkeeping account on
its records (the “Performance Unit Account”) for the Participant and shall record in such Performance Unit Account the number of
Performance Units granted to the Participant. The Participant shall not have any interest in any fund or specific assets

of the Company by reason of this grant or the Performance Unit Account established for the Participant.

3.    Performance Goals.

(a)    Unless a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period (as defined below), the
distribution  of  the  shares  of  Company  Stock  attributable  to  the  Performance  Units  is  contingent  upon  achievement  of  the
performance goals set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Performance Goals”) and the Participant satisfying the continuation of
employment and service with the Employer (as defined in the Plan) requirement described in Paragraph 4 below.

(b)        As  soon  as  administratively  practicable  following  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period  (as  defined  in  Paragraph  3(d)
below),  the  Committee  will  determine  whether  and  to  what  extent  the  Performance  Goals  have  been  met  and  the  number  of
Performance Units the Participant has earned, if any. Except as described in Paragraph 4 below, the Participant must be employed
by, or providing service to, the Employer on the last day of the Performance Period in order to earn the Performance Units.

(c)    If a Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Company is not the surviving corporation
(or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation or entity (the “surviving corporation”)) and the Performance Units are not
converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), then the Performance
Period will end on the date of the Change of Control and the Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as
of the date of the Change of Control (the “Change of Control Date”). In the event the Participant’s Performance Units are assumed
by the surviving corporation but the Participant ceases to be employed by, or providing service to, the surviving corporation (or a
parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation) within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change of Control on account of (i)
a termination of such Participant’s employment by the surviving corporation (or a parent of subsidiary of the surviving corporation)
for any reason other than on account of Cause (as defined in Paragraph 4(e) hereof), or on account of death or Disability (each as
defined in the Plan), or (ii) a termination of employment or service by the Participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Plan), then
the  Performance  Period  will  end  on  the  date  of  such  termination  of  employment  or  service  (the  “Termination  Date”)  and  the
Performance Units will be deemed earned at the Target Award level as of the Termination Date. For purposes of this Grant, “Change
of Control” shall mean as such term is defined in the Plan, except that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of this Grant unless the event constituting the Change of Control constitutes a change in ownership or effective control of
the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, within the meaning of section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and its corresponding regulations.

(d)    For purposes of this Grant, the term “Performance Period” shall mean the three (3)-year period beginning on January 1,

2019 and ending December 31, 2021.

4.    Termination of Employment or Service.

(a)       Except  as  set  forth  in  Paragraphs  3(c)  4(b),  4(c)  or  4(d),  if,  at  least  one  year  after  the  beginning  of  the  Performance
Period, but prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer
on account of any reason other than a termination for Cause (as defined below), the Participant will earn a pro-rata portion of the
Performance Units, if the Performance Goals and the requirements of this Grant are met as of the last day of the Performance Period.
The pro-rata portion earned will be equal to the number of Performance Units that would have been earned if the Participant had
remained employed through the last day of the Performance Period, multiplied by a fraction, which fraction shall be equal to (i) 1/3,
if the Participant’s employment or service with the Employer terminates on or after January 31, 2020, but prior to January 31, 2021;
(ii) 2/3, if the Participant’s employment or service with the Employer terminates on or after January 31, 2021, but prior to January
31, 2022; and (iii) 3/3, if the Participant’s employment or service terminates with the Employer on or after January 31, 2022. If the
Participant  ceases  to  be  employed  by,  or  provide  service  to,  the  Employer  for  any  reason  other  than  on  account  of  Cause,  the
prorated  number of Performance  Units earned by the Participant  pursuant to this Paragraph  4(a) will be distributed  in accordance
with Paragraph 5.

(b)       Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  if  prior  to  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period,  the
Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer on account of Normal Retirement, then the Participant will
earn the number of Performance Units that would have been earned if the Participant has remained employed through the last day of
the Performance Period, if the Performance Goals and the requirements of this Grant are met as of the last day of the Performance
Period. If the Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer on account of Normal Retirement pursuant
to this subparagraph (b), the number of Performance Units that are earned based on the Performance Goals and other requirements of
this  Grant  will  be  distributed  in  accordance  with  Paragraph  5.  For  purposes  of  this  Grant,  “Normal  Retirement”  shall  mean
termination of employment or service with the Employer (other than for Cause) after the Participant has attained age sixty (60) and
has five (5) total years of employment or service with the Employer which includes at least three (3) consecutive full calendar years
of service in the position of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or any combination thereof.

(c)        Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  if  prior  to  the  end  of  the  Performance  Period,  the
Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer on account of Early Retirement, then the Participant will
earn 75% of the number of Performance Units that would have been earned if the Participant had remained employed through the
last day of the Performance  Period,  if the Performance  Goals and the requirements  of this Grant are met as of the last day of the
Performance Period, and unearned Performance Units shall be immediately forfeited. If the Participant ceases to be employed by, or
provide service to, the Employer on account of Early Retirement pursuant to this subparagraph (c), then the number of Performance
Units that are earned based on the Performance Goals and other requirements of this Grant will be distributed in accordance with
Paragraph 5. For purposes of this Grant, “Early Retirement” shall mean termination of employment or service with the Employer
(other than for Cause) after the Participant has attained age fifty-five (55) and has five (5) total years of employment

3

or  service  with  the  Employer  which  includes  at  least  three  (3)  consecutive  full  calendar  years  of  service  in  the  position  of  Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or any combination thereof.

(d)    If at any time prior to January 31, 2022, the Participant’s employment or service with the Employer terminates on

account of Normal Retirement or Early Retirement before achieving five (5) total years of employment or service with the
Employer, but the Participant has completed a minimum of three (3) years of service in the position of Chief Financial Officer and
has achieved the required Normal Retirement or Early Retirement age, then the Participant will earn the number of Performance
Units that would have been earned if the Participant had remained employed through the last day of the Performance Period, if the
Performance Goal and the requirements of this Grant are met as of the last day of the Performance Period following the Participant’s
termination of employment or service on account of Normal Retirement or Early Retirement, so long as the Participant has used
good faith efforts (as determined by the Chief Executive Officer) to identify and develop a Chief Financial Officer successor who is
approved by the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors.

(e)    Except as set forth in Paragraphs 4(b), 4(c) or 4(d), if at any time prior to the earlier of January 31, 2020 or a Change of
Control, the Participant’s employment or service with the Employer is terminated by the Employer on account of any reason or no
reason  or  by  the  Participant  for  any  reason  or  no  reason,  all  of  the  Performance  Units  subject  to  this  Grant  shall  be  immediately
forfeited  as of  the  date  of  the  Participant’s  termination  of  employment  or  service  with  the  Employer  and  the  Participant  shall  not
have any rights with respect to the distribution of any portion of the Performance Units.

(f)    If at any time prior to the date the Performance Units are distributed in accordance with Paragraph 5 the Participant’s
employment or service with the Employer is terminated on account of Cause, all of the Performance Units subject to this Grant shall
be  immediately  forfeited  and  the  Participant  will  not  have  any  rights  with  respect  to  the  distribution  of  any  portion  of  the
Performance  Units,  irrespective  of  the  level  of  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goals.  For  purposes  of  this  Grant,  “Cause” shall
mean a finding by the Committee that the Participant (i) has breached his or her employment or service contract with the Employer,
if  any;  (ii)  has  engaged  in  disloyalty  to  the  Employer,  including,  without  limitation,  fraud,  embezzlement,  theft,  commission  of  a
felony or proven dishonesty; (iii) has disclosed trade secrets or confidential information of the Employer to persons not entitled to
receive such information; (iv) has breached any written noncompetition or non-solicitation agreement between the Participant and
the Employer; or (v) has engaged in such other behavior detrimental to the interests of the Employer as the Committee determines.

5.    Time and Form of Payment with Respect to Performance Units. Unless an election is made pursuant to Paragraph 6 below, the
Participant will receive a distribution with respect to the Performance Units earned as described in Paragraphs 3 and 4 above within
seventy (70) days following the earliest of (a) January 31, 2022 (the “Distribution Date”), (b) the Change of Control Date, or (c) the
Termination  Date.  The  Performance  Units  will  be  distributed  in  shares  of  Company  Stock,  with  each  Performance  Unit  earned
equivalent to one share of Company Stock. Any

4

Performance  Units  not  earned  because  of  the  failure  to  attain  the  Performance  Goals  and  service  condition  will  be  immediately
forfeited.

6.    Deferrals. The Participant may make an irrevocable election to defer the Distribution Date (or further defer the Deferred Date (as
defined below), if applicable) of all of the Performance Units that are earned, plus dividend equivalents earned on such Performance
Units  as  described  in  Paragraph  7  below,  to  a  later  date,  provided  that  (a)  the  election  shall  not  take  effect  until  at  least  twelve
(12) months after the date on which the election is made, (b) the deferred Distribution Date cannot be earlier than five (5) years from
the original Distribution Date under Paragraph 5 above (or five (5) years from the applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral
of  a  Deferred  Date  is  being  made),  and  (c)  the  election  must  be  made  no  less  than  twelve  (12)  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
Distribution Date (twelve (12) months prior to the previously applicable Deferred Date, if a subsequent deferral of a Deferred Date is
being  made).  To  defer  the  Distribution  Date,  the  Participant  must  elect  to  defer  100%  of  the  Performance  Units,  including
corresponding  dividend  equivalents,  earned  by  the  Participant  under  this  Grant,  as  well  as  100%  of  the  other  performance  stock
units, including corresponding dividend equivalents, earned by the Participant under the 2019 LTPP, complete the deferral election
form  provided  to  the  Participant  by  the  Committee,  and  return  such  form  to  the  Company  in  the  manner  and  by  the  deadline
provided  therein.  If the Participant  desires  to make  a further  deferral,  the Participant  must make  such  election  on a separate  form
provided by the Committee for such purpose. Any such election shall be made in accordance with section 409A of the Code and any
corresponding guidance and regulations issued under section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding a Participant’s election pursuant to
this  Paragraph,  if  the  Change  of  Control  Date  or  the  Termination  Date  occurs  prior  to  the  Deferred  Date,  the  distribution  of  the
Participant’s  earned  Performance  Units,  plus  corresponding  dividend  equivalents,  will  be  the  Change  of  Control  Date  or  the
Termination  Date,  as  applicable.  If  a  Distribution  Date  is  delayed  one  or  more  times  pursuant  to  this  Paragraph  6,  the  new
Distribution Date shall be referred to as the “Deferred Date.”

7.    Dividend Equivalents. Until the earlier of the Distribution Date (or the Deferred Date, if elected), the Change of Control Date or
the Termination Date, if any dividends are paid with respect to the shares of Company Stock, the Company shall credit to a dividend
equivalent  account  (the  “Dividend  Equivalent  Account”)  the  value  of  the  dividends  that  would  have  been  distributed  if  the
Performance  Units  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Performance  Unit  Account  as  of  the  date  of  payment  of  any  such  dividend  were
shares of Company Stock. At the same time that the Performance Units are converted to shares of Company Stock and distributed to
the  Participant,  the  Company  shall  pay  to  the  Participant  in  a  lump  sum  cash  equal  to  the  value  of  the  dividends  credited  to  the
Participant’s Dividend Equivalent Account; provided, however, that any dividends that were credited to the Participant’s Dividend
Equivalent Account that are attributable to Performance Units that have been forfeited as provided in Paragraph 3 and 4 above shall
be  forfeited  and  not  payable  to  the  Participant.  No  interest  shall  accrue  on  any  dividend  equivalents  credited  to  the  Participant’s
Dividend Equivalent Account.

8.    Change of Control. Except as set forth above, the provisions set forth in the Plan applicable to a Change of Control (as defined in
the Plan) shall apply to the Performance Units, and, in the event of a Change of Control, the Committee may take such actions as it
deems appropriate pursuant to the Plan and is consistent with the requirements of section 409A of the Code.

5

distribution pursuant to the Plan or this Grant, the Participant is and shall be an unsecured general creditor of the Company without
any  preference  as  against  other  unsecured  general  creditors  of  the  Company,  and  the  Participant  hereby  covenants  for  himself  or

“PSU GRANT B – EPS”

EXHIBIT A

PERFORMANCE GOALS

The number of Performance Units that may be earned shall be determined based on the achievement of Compounded Earnings Per
Share Growth (as described below) over the Performance Period.

Compounded  Earnings  Per  Share  (“EPS”)  Growth –  will  be  calculated  based  on  fully  diluted  EPS  calculated  in  accordance  with
US  GAAP  as  reported  in  the  Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  adjusted  to  exclude  all  items  of  gain,  loss  or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature. The starting point for the calculation will be adjusted EPS of $3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The ending point for the calculation will be EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted to exclude all items of gain, loss or
expense for the fiscal year determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal
of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle or, as determined by the Committee, any other change or
event similar in nature.

The award scale for Compounded EPS Growth is as follows:

Compounded EPS Growth

Actual
Compounded EPS
Growth

11.0% or more

9.8%

8.5%

7.3%

< 6.0%

Target Award
200%

175%

100%

25%

0%

If  actual  achievement  of  the  Performance  Goal  does  not  meet  threshold  performance  (i.e.,  less  than  6.0%  for  Compounded  EPS
Growth, then that Performance Goal will be reflected in the final result for determining the number of earned Performance Units at
its assigned weighting with a 0%. The maximum award that may be earned for each Performance Goal is capped at 200%, and the
maximum award that may be earned by the Participant is capped at 200% of the Target Award.

11

Example:

The following is an example calculation for a Participant with a Target Award of 1,000 Performance Units:

Earnings Per Share

12/31/2018

In this example, the individual who was awarded a Target Grant of 1,000 Performance Units would earn 1,275 Performance Units
(1,000 x 1.275), which is convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Company Stock assuming all other terms and conditions
of the Grant have been satisfied.

PENSION PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES OF
AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC.
AND ITS DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARIES

(As Amended And Restated Effective January 1, 2016)

ARTICLE I.
PURPOSE

The purpose of this Plan is to provide retirement income for participating Employees. The pensions provided by the Plan will
be  in  addition  to  any  Social  Security  benefits  payable  under  Federal  or  State  law.  The  provisions  of  this  Plan  shall  govern  with
respect to retirement income over any bargaining unit agreement, but shall not supersede, modify, change or substitute any terms and
provisions  not  relating  to  retirement  income  of  participating  Employees  that  appear  in  such  agreements.  The  rules  set  out  in
Appendix 2 shall apply should the Plan become a Top-Heavy Plan, as defined therein.

Effective as of July 1, 2011, in connection with that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 23, 2011, by and
among the Company, Arizona-American Water Company, New Mexico-American Water Company, Inc. and EPCOR Water (USA),
Inc., pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell all of the issued and outstanding stock of Arizona-American Water Company and
New Mexico-American Water Company, Inc. to EPCOR Water (USA), Inc., (the “Sale”) the Company is transferring the assets and
liabilities attributable to those Participants who are, or were previously, employed by Arizona-American Water Company and New
Mexico-American  Water  Company,  Inc.  to  the  Pension  Plan  for  Employees  of  Arizona-American  Water  Company  and  New
Mexico-American  Water  Company,  Inc.  (the  “Arizona-New  Mexico  Pension  Plan”),  a  new  pension  plan  established  for  such
Participants.  Such  assets  and  liabilities  include  those  attributable  to  active  Participants  as  of  June  30,  2011,  terminated  vested
Participants, and retired Participants (or their Beneficiaries) who are receiving benefit payments from the Plan, all of whom are, or
were previously, employed by Arizona-American Water Company or New Mexico-American Water Company, Inc. (collectively, the
“Arizona-New  Mexico  Employees”).  Any  benefit  to  which  an  Arizona-New  Mexico  Employee  may  have  been  entitled  under  the
Plan immediately prior to July 1, 2011 shall not be provided under the Plan, but instead shall be provided under the Arizona-New
Mexico Pension Plan. In addition, with respect to any Participant who is transferred to the employment of Arizona-American Water
Company  and  New  Mexico-American  Water  Company,  Inc.  from  the  Employer  on  or  after  July  1,  2011  and  prior  to  the
consummation date of the Sale, assets and liabilities with respect to such Participant’s Accrued Benefit under the Plan, if any, shall
be  transferred  to  the  Arizona-New  Mexico  Pension  Plan.  Furthermore,  with  respect  to  any  participant  under  the  Arizona-New
Mexico Pension Plan who transfers employment from Arizona-American

Water  Company  and  New  Mexico-American  Water  Company,  Inc.  to  the  Employer  prior  to  the  consummation  date  of  the  Sale,
assets  and  liabilities  with  respect  to  such  participant’s  Accrued  Benefit  under  the  Arizona-New  Mexico  Pension  Plan  shall  be
transferred  back  to  this  Plan  and  be  payable  from  this  Plan  to  such  transferred  participant.  The  Arizona-New  Mexico  Employees
described in this paragraph are identified in Appendix 6 attached hereto.

Effective  as  of  May  1,  2012,  in  connection  with  that  certain  Stock  Purchase  Agreement,  dated  as  of  July  8,  2011,  by  and
among the Company, Ohio-American Water Company, and Aqua Ohio, Inc. ("Aqua Ohio"), pursuant to which the Company agreed
to  sell  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  stock  of  Ohio-American  Water  Company  to  Aqua  Ohio  (the  "Sale"),  the  Company  is
transferring  the  assets  and  liabilities  attributable  to  those  Participants  who  are,  or  were  previously,  employed  by  Ohio-American
Water Company to the Retirement Income Plan for Aqua America, Inc. and Subsidiaries ("Aqua Plan"). Such assets and liabilities
include those attributable to active Participants as of April 30, 2012, terminated vested Participants, and retired Participants (or their
Beneficiaries) who are receiving benefit payments from the Plan, all of whom are, or were previously, employed by Ohio-American
Water Company ("Ohio Employees"). Any benefit to which an Ohio Employee may have been entitled under the Plan immediately
prior to May 1, 2012 shall not be provided under the Plan, but instead shall be provided under the Aqua Plan.

The amendment and restatement of the Plan is effective January 1, 2016, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

The benefits payable under this Plan with respect to any Participant whose service terminated before January 1, 2016 shall be
determined under the provisions of the Plan as in effect when such Participant’s service with the Employer terminated, except that
the  factors  under  Tables  2  through  4(a)  shall  be  derived  from  the  Tables  in  effect  when  the  benefit  in  question  is  to  begin.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the benefits payable under this Plan with respect to any individual who participated in a merged plan
but  terminated  employment  before  the  date  that  plan  was  merged  into  this  Plan  shall  be  determined  under  the  provisions  of  the
merged plan as in effect at the time the individual terminated employment.

Except as otherwise provided in an applicable Appendix, the terms of the Plan are as follows:

Service or approved leave of absence for sickness, accident or other cause shall not be considered an interruption or termination of
employment.  Employees  similarly  situated  shall  be  accorded  uniform  and  nondiscriminatory  treatment  by  the  Committee  in
approving  leaves  of  absence.  A  completed  year  of  Continuous  Service  means  a  12  month  period  ending  on  the  day  prior  to  the

414(n)(2)  of  the  Code,  provided  that  if  the  total  number  of  Leased  Employees  constitutes  20%  or  less  of  the  Employer’s
nonhighly compensated work force, within the meaning of section 414(n)(5)(C)(ii) of the Code. The term “Employee” shall

period  (or  lesser  period  of  employment)  applicable  in  the  determination  of  Final  Average  Earnings  a  Participant  is  absent  due  to
layoff, sickness or accident, Qualified Military Service, leave of absence or other cause to the extent specified in Section 2.1(nn)(ii),
his  Earnings  during  such  period  of  absence  shall  be  considered  to  be  his  Scheduled  Monthly  Earnings.  If  within  such  60  month
period the Participant is absent due to a cause not specified in Section 2.1(nn)(ii), including but not limited to a strike or other work
stoppage, his Final Average Earnings shall be computed on the basis of the last 60 months (or lesser period of employment) during
which he actually received Earnings, or is absent under such circumstances that he is credited with Hours of Service under Section
2.1(nn)(ii). If a Participant does not have Earnings for 60 consecutive months, that Participant’s Final Average Earnings shall be the
amount determined by dividing that Participant’s Earnings as an eligible Employee by the number of months in which Earnings were
actually received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining Final Average Earnings, overtime in the last month worked prior to
the pension effective date will be the average monthly overtime earned during the twelve months prior to the month in which the
Employee submits his application for retirement.

irrevocably committed to the purchase of annuity contracts, or by the Trustee or any other Investment Manager, for the purpose of

an Employee shall be credited with no more than 501 Hours of Service on account of any single continuous period during

maximum  of  501  hours,  during  any  period  throughout  which  the  individual  is  absent  from  employment  because  of  the
individual’s  pregnancy,  the  birth  of  the  individual’s  child,  placement  of  a child  with  the  individual  in  connection  with  the

Years of Service earned by Employees who are not included in an “Eligible Union Group,” as described in Section

a  Year  of  Service  for  the  purpose  of  computing  the  retirement  income  benefit,  if  any,  to  which  such  individual  is  entitled
under this Plan.

A Participant  shall receive  credit  for a partial  Year of Service  for an employment  period  of fewer than 12 months.
That credit shall be determined as a fraction, the denominator of which shall be 365 and the numerator of which shall be the
number of days in the period beginning on the last anniversary date of his employment prior to the termination of his service
or  his  Normal,  Late,  Early  or  Disability  Retirement  Date,  and  ending  on  the  date  of  the  termination  of  his  service  or  his
Normal,  Late,  Early  or  Disability  Retirement  Date,  if  his  Hours  of  Service  for  such  period  equaled,  or  when  annualized,
would equal 1,000 or more.

(iv)       Special Rules.  For  special  service  rules  to  be  applied  in  computing  Years  of  Service  for  purposes  of  benefit
accrual, vesting and for meeting the eligibility requirements for survivor benefits or for a Normal, Late, Early or Disability

Union  Participants  described  in  Section  5.2(d)  shall  cease  to be  credited  with  Years  of  Service  after  December  31,

December 31, 2005 will be credited for purposes of vesting and for meeting the eligibility requirements for survivor benefits
and Normal, Late, Early or Disability Retirement.

Water  Works  Service  Company,  Inc.  to  American  Water  Enterprises,  Inc.  effective  December  26,  2011  who  is  listed  in
Appendix  7,  shall  continue  to  be  credited  with  Years  of  Service  on  and  after  December  26,  2011  for  purposes  of  benefit
accrual, as well as for vesting and for meeting the eligibility requirements for survivor benefits or for Normal, Late, Early or
Disability  Retirement  Date,  until  such  Participant  subsequently  terminates  employment  or  is  transferred  from  his  or  her
December 26, 2011 classification to an ineligible employment classification.

Notwithstanding  any  provisions in  the  Plan  to  the  contrary,  any  non-union  Participant  who,  immediately  prior  to  a
transfer  of  employment  to  American  Water  Enterprises,  Inc.,  is eligible  to  accrue  additional  benefits  under  the  Plan  under
Section 3.2(b), shall continue to be credited with Years of Service on and after such transfer to American Water Enterprises,
Inc. for purposes of benefit accrual, as well as for vesting and for meeting the eligibility requirements for survivor benefits or

(c)    Any Participant who, on or after January 1, 2006, ceases for any reason to be eligible to accrue benefits under the Plan

(a)    Any other provision of this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, if any labor organization, which shall be recognized by
the Company or a Designated Subsidiary as the representative for purposes of collective bargaining of any unit of Employees, does
not enter into an agreement with the Company or a Designated Subsidiary providing for the participation of such Employees in this
Plan, or having entered into such an agreement fails or refuses to continue the same in effect, the Employees so represented shall not,
except to the extent of such Employees’ vested interest under Section 8.1, be Participants in, or eligible to participate in, this Plan, its
benefits, or in the funds held by the Insurance Company, the Trustee or any Investment Manager, provided that if the absence of an
agreement occurs only during a period of negotiations which culminate in a new agreement providing for the participation of such
Employees in this Plan, such Employees shall not lose any of the rights which they would otherwise have had hereunder.

(b)    If any Employee becomes a Participant following a period during which he was ineligible to participate by reason of this

termination of employment. Such notification shall state that benefit payments are not being paid, in accordance with this Section
3.4, because the Participant is remaining in active employment, and shall include a copy of this Section 3.4 and a statement to the
effect that applicable Department of Labor regulations may be found at 29 CFR § 2530.203-3.

ARTICLE IV.
RETIREMENT

Section 4.1    Normal Retirement and Late Retirement.

(a)    Upon retirement at his Normal Retirement Date a Participant shall be entitled to receive a monthly retirement income
commencing on his Normal Retirement Date in an amount determined under Sections 5.2, 5.6, 5.7 and, if applicable, Section 6.1(a).

(b)    A Participant who continues to be employed after his Normal Retirement Date shall be entitled to receive a monthly
retirement income commencing on his Late Retirement Date in an amount determined under Sections 5.2, 5.6, 5.7 and, if applicable,
Section 6.1(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an executive shall have a Late Retirement Date only if he continues in employment
with the Employer after his Normal Retirement Date by consent of the Company.

(c)    For purposes of this Section 4.1, an “executive” means a Participant:

(i)    who is an executive as defined in 29 CFR.541.1 and EEOC Reg. section 1625.12;

(ii)    who is (A) in charge of a significant and substantial local or regional operation of the Employer, (B) in charge of

a department or division of the Employer, or (C) in a high policy making position with the Employer;

(iii)    who has attained age 65;

(iv)    who has been in a position described in Sections 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) for the two year period immediately prior to

his retirement; and

(v)       who is entitled to an immediate nonforfeitable annual retirement income, payable in the form of a single life
annuity  commencing  at  age  65  (or  retirement,  if  later),  from  all  employee  pension,  profit  sharing,  savings  and  deferred
compensation plans sponsored by the Employer, which equals, in the aggregate, at least $44,000 (or such other amount as
may be described pursuant to 29 C.F.R. 541.1). There shall be excluded from the calculation of the retirement income all of
the Participant’s contributions to all plans, including amounts rolled over from the plans of previous employers.

Section 4.2    Early Retirement.

(a)    A Participant may retire on the first day of any month occurring on or after both attaining his Early Retirement Date and

making application in writing therefor to his Employer at

15

least  two  full  calendar  months  in  advance.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  a  Subsidiary  is  named  as  a  Designated
Subsidiary effective after December 31, 1971, a Participant who is an Employee of such Designated Subsidiary may not retire under
this Section 4.2(a) before being credited with five Years of Service under this Plan.

(b)    In the event of retirement under the provisions of Section 4.2(a), the date of a Participant’s actual retirement shall be his
Early  Retirement  Date  and  upon  retirement  at  his  Early  Retirement  Date  a  Participant  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  a  monthly
retirement  income  commencing  on  his  Early  Retirement  Date  in  an  amount  determined  under  Sections  5.4,  5.6,  5.7  and,  if
applicable, Section 6.1(a).

(c)    In the event a Participant who has applied for Social Security disability benefits applies for an Early Retirement benefit
under this Section 4.2, commences payment of his Early Retirement benefit as of his elected Annuity Starting Date, and such elected
Annuity Starting Date occurs prior to the date that an award of total and permanent disability benefits is made by the United States
Social Security Administration (the “Award”), such Participant shall not be permitted to change his Early Retirement benefit to a
Disability Retirement benefit payable under Section 4.3 following the date of the Award. The foregoing shall apply regardless of the
date of disability that is referenced in the Award. For purposes of clarity, a Participant for whom payment of his Early Retirement
benefit  has  not  yet  commenced  as  of  his  elected  Annuity  Starting  Date  due  to  administrative  delay  shall  be  treated  as  having
commenced payment of his Early Retirement benefit as of his elected Annuity Starting Date.

Section 4.3    Disability Retirement.

(a)    A Participant who has completed 10 or more Years of Service, and who qualifies for disability  retirement under this
Section 4.3(a) shall be retired as of the first day of the month following the first month in which the Committee has received both (i)
the  Participant’s  written  request  for  disability  retirement,  and  (ii)  evidence  reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  Committee  that  the
Participant  has  been  determined  by  the  United  States  Social  Security  Administration  to  qualify  for  total  and  permanent  disability
benefits  under  the Social  Security  Act.  A Participant  shall  be eligible  for disability  retirement  benefits  if,  as a result  of  mental  or
physical  illness  or  injury  (other  than  self-inflicted)  while  actively  employed,  he  qualifies  for  disability  benefits  under  the  Social
Security  Act.  Disability  benefit  payments  shall  commence  in  either  the  month  in  which  the  disabled  Participant  is  retired,  as
described  above,  or  in  the  next  following  month,  as  may  be  administratively  practicable.  Such  payments  under  the  Plan  shall  be
made retroactively to the first day of the month following the date as of which the Participant is deemed to be disabled by the Social
Security Administration, or, if later, to the last day of the Participant’s eligibility for continuation of the Participant’s salary or hourly
wages as sick pay under an applicable Employer sick pay plan. The sum of any retroactive payments shall be paid in a lump sum,
without interest, as part of the first monthly payment of disability benefits. A Participant shall provide such reasonable evidence of
continued Social Security

16

disability  as  the  Committee  may  require  from  time  to  time.  Disability  benefits  shall  be  discontinued  if  the  Participant  ceases  to
qualify for disability benefits under the Social Security Act. A Participant who becomes disabled, while actively employed, on or
after attaining age 65, shall be considered to have retired under Section 4.1 and will be entitled to a monthly retirement income, if
any, in an amount determined under Sections 5.2, 5.6, 5.7 and, if applicable, Section 6.1(a).

(b)    Notwithstanding the above, if a Participant’s disability is determined by the Social Security Administration to qualify
under the Social Security Act prior to July 1, 2001, and the Participant’s benefit was in pay status, the benefit shall be determined
under the provisions of the Plan in effect prior to July 1, 2001.

(c)    In the event of retirement under the provisions of Section 4.3, the date specified in Section 4.3 shall be the Participant’s
Disability Retirement Date, and the Participant shall be entitled to receive for life, or as long as his disability continues to qualify
under the Social Security Act, a monthly retirement income commencing on his Disability Retirement Date in an amount determined
under Sections 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and, if applicable, Section 6.1(a); provided that if at his Disability Retirement Date, a Participant would
be  eligible  for  Early  Retirement  but  for  the  two  months’  notice  requirement,  he  may  elect  to  retire  early  under  the  provisions  of
Section 4.2(a).

(d)    A Participant shall not be eligible for a benefit payable under this Section 4.3 if the provisions of Section 4.2(c) apply.

December  31,  2005  and  no  further  benefits  shall  accrue  for  such  Participant  under  the  Plan  after  December  31,  2005.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, union Employees who:

(i)    are employed at the Company's Sterling, Illinois facility and were hired or re-hired prior to February 1, 2009,

actively employed on July 1, 1994 was based on Earnings in excess of $150,000, such Accrued Benefit shall be frozen as of June 30,

such Designated Subsidiary, shall have the exclusive and binding discretion to make such adjustment as it determines to be equitable
under  all  of  the  circumstances  to  the  end  that  there  be  no  duplication  of  benefits  under  this  Plan  and  any  other  plan  or  plans.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no such adjustment shall be made for such amounts as are attributable to the Participant’s
contributions to such other plan or plans.

ARTICLE VI.
BENEFIT ELECTIONS, SURVIVOR BENEFITS
AND RELATED REDUCTIONS IN BENEFITS

Section 6.1    Automatic Surviving Spouse Benefit.

(a)    Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. A Participant who is married on his Annuity Starting Date, shall be paid a benefit
for  his  life  equal  to  that  percentage  determined  by  his  attained  age  and  the  attained  age  of  his  spouse,  set  forth  in  the  Table  of
Contingent  Annuitant  Percentages  attached  to  the  Plan  as  Table  2,  of  his  normal  retirement  income  under  Section  5.2,  his  early
retirement income under Section 5.4 or his disability retirement income under Section 5.5; and his spouse, if such spouse survives
him, shall be paid a benefit equal to 50% of his reduced benefit. For any Participant retiring on a Late Retirement Date, Table 2 shall
be  applied  based  on  the  Participant’s  attained  age  and  the  attained  age  of  the  Participant’s  spouse  as  of  the  Participant’s  Late
Retirement Date.

If  a  Participant’s  spouse  dies  within  two  years  of  the  date  payments  to  the  Participant  begin  under  this  Section  6.1(a),
beginning with the first payment following the death of such spouse, monthly retirement income payments to the Participant will be
adjusted  to  be  equal  to  the  monthly  amount  that  would  have  been  paid  to  the  Participant  if  the  Participant’s  benefit  had  been
determined solely under Section 5.8(a).

(b)    Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.

(i)    Death Prior to Early Retirement  Eligibility  and Prior to Completing  Ten Years of Service. In the event of the
death  of  an  actively  employed  married  Participant  who  had  competed  at  least  five  Years  of  Service  but  before  he  had
completed at least ten Years of Service, such Participant’s spouse shall be entitled to a benefit, payable, if such spouse is then
surviving, on the first day of the month coincident with, or next following the later of (A) the date of the Participant’s death
or (B) the date the Participant would have attained

21

age 55 had he survived, elected the 50% contingent annuity form of benefit, as determined under Table 2 based on his and his
spouse’s then attained ages, and then died.

(ii)        Death  Prior  to  Early  Retirement  Eligibility  but  After  Ten  Years  of  Service.  In  the  event  of  a  married
Participant’s death while actively employed, after he has completed ten Years of Service but prior to becoming eligible for
Early  Retirement,  such  Participant’s  spouse  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  the  same  monthly  benefit  to  which  the  Participant
would  have  been  entitled  had  the  Participant  retired  on  the  day  before  his  death  and  had  elected  to  receive  the  100%
contingent annuity form of benefit. The amount of such benefit shall be determined under Table 4, based on his attained age
and the attained age of his spouse, except that for purposes of applying Table 4, the Participant’s attained age, if less than age
55, shall be considered to be age 55 and his spouse’s age shall be adjusted so that it bears the same relationship to age 55 as
their actual attained ages bear to each other.

(iii)        Death  After  Becoming  Eligible  for  Early  Retirement.  In  the  event  of  a  married  Participant’s  death,  while
actively employed, while he is eligible for Early Retirement but for the applicable notice requirement under Section 4.2(a),
such  Participant’s  spouse  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  the  same  monthly  benefit  to  which  the  Participant  would  have  been
entitled had the Participant retired on the day before his death and had elected to receive the 100% contingent annuitant form
of benefit as determined under Table 4, based on his attained age and the attained age of his spouse.

(iv)        Death  After  Becoming  Eligible  for  Normal  Retirement.  In  the  event  of  a  married  Participant’s  death  while
actively employed, after his Normal Retirement Date, such Participant’s spouse shall be entitled to receive the same monthly
benefit  to  which  the  Participant  would  have  been  entitled  had  the  Participant  retired  on  his  Late  Retirement  Date  and  had
elected to receive the 100% contingent annuitant form of benefit as determined under Table 4, based on his attained age and
the attained age of his spouse.

(v)    Death of Vested Terminated Participant. In the event of a married Participant’s death after he had completed five
Years of Service, but before he had become eligible for Early Retirement, and who was not actively employed at the time of
his death, such Participant’s spouse shall be entitled to a benefit, payable, if such spouse is then surviving, on the first day of
the month coincident with, or next following the later of (A) the date of the Participant’s death or (B) the date the Participant
would have attained age 55 had he survived, elected the 50% contingent annuity form of benefit, as determined under Table 2
based  on  his  and  his  spouse’s  then  attained  ages,  and  then  died.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  a  married
Participant  who  is  no  longer  actively  employed  dies  after  he  has  become  eligible  to  elect  to  receive  retirement  income
benefits under Section 8.1 and before his Normal Retirement Date, such Participant shall be considered to be actively

22

employed on the date of his death, and his spouse, if surviving, will receive a benefit in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(iii)
above.

Any benefit payable under this Section 6.1 shall terminate on the surviving spouse’s death.

Section 6.2    Notice and Election Procedures.

(a)        Initial  Notice  and  Election.  Within  180  days  (90  days  for  plan  years  beginning  prior  to  January  1,  2007)  before  a
Participant’s Annuity Starting Date, the Committee shall supply the Participant with a written explanation describing the terms and
conditions of the normal form of benefit payable to him under Section 5.8, the financial effect of the other forms of benefit available
to him under the Plan and the relative value of the other forms of benefit compared to the normal form of benefit. The explanation
shall  also  describe  the  Participant’s  right  to  waive  the  normal  form  of  benefit  and  the  effect  of  such  waiver,  the  rights  of  the
Participant’s spouse, the right to revoke a previous waiver of the normal form of benefit, the effect of such a revocation and, if the
Participant has not reached his or her Normal Retirement Date, the consequences of failing to defer payment until a later payment
date. Finally, the explanation shall advise the Participant that his benefit shall be paid in such normal form, unless within 180 days
(90  days  for  plan  years  beginning  prior  to  January  1,  2007)  before  his  Annuity  Starting  Date,  he  notifies  the  Committee  of  an
election to receive a different form of benefit, and, if he is married:

(i)    his spouse consents to his election in writing,

(ii)    such election designates a Contingent Annuitant or Annuitants other than his spouse (or form of benefit) that
may not be changed without spousal consent, or the spouse’s consent acknowledges the spouse’s right to limit consent to a
specific Contingent Annuitant or Annuitants (or form of benefit), and expressly and voluntarily permits designations by the
Participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse; and

(iii)    the spouse’s consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a notary public.

(iv)        Spouse  shall  mean  effective  June  26,  2013,  the  individual  to  whom  a  Participant  is  married,  including  a
marriage  of  same-sex  spouses  that  was  validly  entered  into  in  a domestic  or  foreign  jurisdiction  whose  laws  authorize  the
marriage of two individuals of the same sex even if the married couple resides in a domestic or foreign jurisdiction that does
not recognize the validity of same-sex marriages. Marriage does not include registered domestic partnerships, civil unions, or
other similar formal relationships recognized under state law that are not denominated as a marriage under that state’s law,
and  the  term  “Spouse”  does  not  include  individuals  who  have  entered  into  such  a  formal  relationship.  Spouse  means  the
spouse of a Participant on the date benefits under the Plan commence, however, if the Participant should die prior to the date
benefits under the Plan

23

would have commenced to him/her, then the spouse will be the spouse to whom the Participant was married on the date of
death.  To  the  extent  provided,  under  a  qualified  domestic  relations  order,  the  “Spouse”  means  a  former  Spouse  of  the
Participant.

(b)    Election Period; Extension of Election Period. A Participant’s election period under this Section 6.2 shall be the 180 day
period (90 day period for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2007) ending on his Annuity Starting Date. If, by not later than the
day before his Annuity Starting Date, the Participant notifies the Committee of an election not to receive the normal form of benefit
payable to him under Section 5.8, and his spouse (if any) has consented to such election, his benefit shall be paid in the alternate
form selected by the Participant.

However, if by not later than the day before his Annuity Starting Date, the Participant requests the Committee to furnish him with
additional information relating to the effect of the normal form of benefit payable to him under the Plan, the election period under
this Section 6.2 shall be extended and his Annuity Starting Date shall be postponed to a date not later than 180 days (90 days for plan
years beginning prior to January 1, 2007) following the date the Committee furnishes him with the additional information.

(c)    Change of Election - Optional Form of Benefit. Any Participant electing an optional form of benefit under Section 6.3 or
Section  6.4  may  revoke  such  election  and  file  a  new  election  with  the  Committee  at  any  time  prior  to  the  Participant’s  Annuity
Starting Date. Upon the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date, his election shall become irrevocable.

(d)    Notice and Election Procedures for Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity. Within the one year period beginning on
the date an Employee becomes a Participant, the Committee shall provide the Participant with a written explanation of the spouse’s
preretirement death benefit. The written explanation shall notify the Participant that if he is married and he dies before his Annuity
Starting Date, his spouse shall receive the spouse’s preretirement death benefit determined under Section 6.1(b).

Section 6.3    Monthly Income for Life Election. A Participant who is married on his Annuity Starting Date may, with his
spouse’s  written  and  notarized  consent,  elect  to  have  his  normal  or  late  retirement  income  under  Section  5.2,  his early  retirement
income under Section 5.4, or his disability retirement income under Section 5.5, in each case as limited by Section 5.6 and 5.7, paid
in the form described in Section 5.8(a).

Section 6.4    Survivor Benefits Available by Election.

(a)    Participants whose benefits are not subject to an automatic surviving spouse benefit under Section 6.1 or who, with their
spouse’s written and notarized  consent as described in Section 6.2, elect not to accept an automatic  surviving spouse benefit may
elect to provide benefits for their Contingent Annuitants as described below.

24

(b)    Upon written notice executed by a Participant and filed with his Employer at least 60 days prior to his actual retirement
date, a Participant may, subject to the limitations of this Section 6.4, designate any individual as his Contingent Annuitant and at the
same time elect:

(i)    a reduced benefit for life with the continuation of (A) 50%, (B) 75% (effective for Annuity Starting Dates after
June 30, 2008), (C) 66-2/3%, or (D) 100% of such reduced benefit to his surviving Contingent Annuitant for the life of such
Contingent Annuitant; or

(ii)       a reduced benefit for life with the continuation  of 100% of such reduced benefit to his Contingent  Annuitant
only to the extent required for the total number of monthly payments to the Participant and his Contingent Annuitant to equal
either (A) 60, (B) 120, or (C) 180.

(c)    In the event of such a designation and election, the reduced retirement income payments will be paid to the Participant,
commencing on his Normal, Late, Early or Disability Retirement Date. The first payment, if any, to the Contingent Annuitant shall
be  made  on  the  first  day  of  the  calendar  month  coincident  with  or  following  the  death  of  the  Participant,  or  as  soon  as
administratively possible following the death of the Participant, provided payment is made retroactively to the first day of the month
following the Participant’s death. Payments to the Participant shall terminate with the last payment payable preceding his death.

(d)    Any such election shall become effective upon the Participant’s retirement unless otherwise provided by the Participant.
The amount of the Participant’s  reduced retirement  benefit shall be determined by multiplying  his normal, late, early or disability
retirement  income  by  a  percentage  set  forth  in  Table  2,  3,  4,  or  4(a),  as  appropriate,  depending  upon  his  age  and  the  age  of  his
Contingent Annuitant as of the Participant’s actual retirement date.

(e)    If a Contingent Annuitant dies within two years of the date payments to the Participant begin under this Section 6.4,
other  than  payments  in  a  form  described  in  Section  6.4(b)(ii),  monthly  retirement  income  payments  to  the  Participant  will  be
adjusted beginning with the first payment following the death of such Contingent Annuitant, to be equal to the monthly amount that
would  have  been  paid  to  the  Participant  if  the  Participant’s  benefit  had  been  determined  solely  under  Section  5.8(a).  No  such
adjustment will be made to the benefit of a Participant whose benefit is being paid in a form described in Section 6.4(b)(ii).

(f)    If a Participant’s Contingent Annuitant is anyone other than his spouse, the present value of the payments to be made to
the Participant as of the date such payments are to commence, computed by using the same mortality and interest assumptions as are
used for purposes of Tables 2, 3, 4, and 4(a) must be more than 50% of the present value, as of such date and similarly computed, of
all payments to be made to the Participant and his Contingent Annuitant. Any election of a Contingent Annuitant made in violation
of this provision shall be void.

25

(g)    In the event of the death of the Participant’s Contingent Annuitant prior to the Participant’s actual retirement date, the

election of a Contingent Annuitant under Section 6.4 shall be inoperative.

Section  6.5        Death  Benefits  for  Unmarried  Participants.  An  unmarried  Participant  who  is  actively  employed  on  or  after
January  1,  2006  and  who  has  completed  at  least  five  Years  of  Service  may  designate  a  Contingent  Annuitant.  The  benefit  to  be
provided to that Contingent Annuitant shall be as specified in (a) through (c) below:

(a)    For Active and Terminated Vested Participants: Death Prior to Early Retirement Eligibility and Prior to Completing Ten
Years of Service. In the event of an unmarried Participant’s death after he had completed five Years of Service, but before he had
become  eligible  for  Early  Retirement,  whether  such  Participant  is  then  actively  employed  or  not,  such  Participant’s  Contingent
Annuitant  shall  be  entitled  to  a  benefit,  payable,  if  such  Contingent  Annuitant  is  then  surviving,  on  the  first  day  of  the  month
coincident with or next following the later of (i) the date of the Participant’s death or (ii) the date the Participant would have attained
age 55 had he survived. The amount of such benefit shall be the same amount that such surviving Contingent Annuitant would have
received  had  such  Participant  terminated  his  service,  survived  to  age  55,  elected  the  50%  contingent  annuity  form  of  benefit,  as
determined under Table 2 based on his and his Contingent Annuitant’s then attained ages, and then died.

(b)    For Active Participants: Death Prior to Early Retirement Eligibility but After Ten Years of Service. In the event of an
unmarried Participant’s death while actively employed, after he has completed ten Years of Service but prior to becoming eligible
for  Early  Retirement,  such  Participant’s  Contingent  Annuitant  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  the  same  monthly  benefit  to  which  the
Participant  would  have  been  entitled  had  the  Participant  retired  on  the  day  before  his  death  and  elected  to  receive  the  100%
contingent annuity form of benefit. The amount of such benefit shall be determined under Table 4, based on his attained age and the
attained age of his Contingent Annuitant, except that for purposes of applying Table 4, the Participant’s attained age, if less than age
55, shall be considered to be age 55 and his Contingent Annuitant’s age shall be adjusted so that it bears the same relationship to age
55 as their actual attained ages bear to each other.

(c)    Death After Becoming Eligible for Early Retirement.

(i)    Actively Employed Participants. In the event of an unmarried Participant’s death, while actively employed and
after  becoming  eligible  for  Early  Retirement  including  after  the  Participant’s  Normal  Retirement  Date,  such  Participant’s
Contingent Annuitant shall be entitled to receive the same monthly benefit to which the Participant would have been entitled
had the Participant retired on the day before death and elected to receive the 100% contingent annuitant form of benefit as
determined under Table 4, based on his attained age and the attained age of his Contingent Annuitant.

26

(ii)        Terminated  Participants.  In  the  event  of  an  unmarried  Participant’s  death  after  his  employment  with  the
Employer  has  terminated  and  after  becoming  eligible  for  Early  Retirement  including  after  the  Participant’s  Normal
Retirement Date, such Participant’s Contingent Annuitant shall be entitled to receive the same monthly benefit to which the
Participant  would  have  been  entitled  had  the  Participant  retired  on  the  day  before  death  and  elected  to  receive  the  100%
contingent  annuitant  form  of  benefit  as  determined  under  Table  4,  based  on  his  attained  age  and  the  attained  age  of  his
Contingent Annuitant.

(d)    Any benefit payable under this Section 6.5 shall terminate on the surviving Contingent Annuitant’s death.

Section  6.6        Required  Distributions  -  Code  Section  401(a)(9).  Distributions  under  this  Section  6.6  shall  be  made  in
accordance  with  section  401(a)(9)  of  the  Code  and  the  regulations  thereunder,  as  generally  described  in  this  Section  6.6.  The
provisions  of  this  Section  6.6  shall  supersede  any  distribution  option  otherwise  provided  in  the  Plan  to  the  extent  that  it  is
inconsistent with section 401(a)(9) of the Code, but shall not create or increase any benefit. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to
the  contrary,  the  form  and  the  timing  of  all  distributions  under  the  Plan  shall  be  in  accordance  with  regulations  issued  by  the
Department  of  the  Treasury  under  section  401(a)(9)  of  the  Code,  including  the  incidental  death  benefit  requirements  of  section
401(a)(9)(G)  of  the  Code.  The  Plan  shall  apply  the  minimum  distribution  requirements  of  section  401(a)(9)  of  the  Code  in
accordance with the final regulations under section 401(a)(9) that were published on April 17, 2002 and June 15, 2004, as set forth in
Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-2 through 1.401(a)(9)-9. The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall override any provisions of the Plan to the
contrary.

(a)    Time and Manner of Distribution.

(i)    Required Beginning Date. The Participant’s entire interest shall be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the

Participant no later than the Participant’s Required Beginning Date.

(ii)        Death  of  Participant  Before  Distributions  Begin.  If  the  Participant  dies  before  distributions  begin  and  the
Participant’s Beneficiary is entitled to receive a death benefit, the Participant’s entire interest shall be distributed, or begin to
be distributed, no later than as follows:

(A)    If the Participant’s surviving spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary, then distributions
to the surviving spouse shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have reached age
70½, if later.

27

(B)        If  the  Participant’s  surviving  spouse  is  not  the  Participant’s  sole  Designated  Beneficiary,  then
distributions to the Designated Beneficiary shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following
the calendar year in which the Participant died.

(C)        If  there  is  no  Designated  Beneficiary  as  of  September  30  of  the  year  following  the  year  of  the
Participant’s  death  and  benefits  are  payable  in  the  form  of  a  life  and  certain  annuity  under  Section  6.4(b),  the
Participant’s  entire  interest  shall  be  distributed  to  the  Participant’s  estate  by  the  December  31  of  the  calendar  year
containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant’s death.

(D)    If the Participant’s surviving spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving
spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions  to the surviving spouse begin, this Section 6.6(a)(ii), other
than Section 6.6(a)(ii)(A), shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.

For  purposes  of  this  Section  6.6(a)(ii)  and  Section  6.6(d),  distributions  are  considered  to  begin  on  the  Participant’s  Required
Beginning Date (or, if Section 6.6(a)(ii)(D) applies, the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section
6.6(a)(ii)(A)). If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant’s Required Beginning Date (or to
the Participant’s surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section 6.6(a)(ii)
(B)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.

(iii)    Form of Distribution. Unless the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an
insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first Distribution Calendar Year
distributions shall be made in accordance with Sections 6.6(b), (c) and (d). If the Participant’s interest is distributed in the
form  of  an  annuity  purchased  from  an  insurance  company,  distributions  thereunder  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the
requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

(b)    Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year.

(i)    General Annuity Requirements. If the Participant’s interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the

Plan, payments under the annuity shall satisfy the following requirements:

(A)    the annuity distributions shall be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year;

28

(B)    the distribution period shall be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain not longer than the period

described in Sections 6.6(c) and (d);

(C)        once  payments  have  begun  over  a  period  certain,  the  period  certain  shall  not  be  changed  even  if  the

period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted;

(D)    payments shall either be non-increasing or increase only as follows:

(1)    by an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-

living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics;

(2)    to the extent of the reduction in the amount of the Participant’s payments to provide for a survivor
benefit upon death, but only if the Beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period
described in Section 6.6(c) dies or is no longer the Participant’s Beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic
relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the Code;

(3)    to provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the Participant’s death; or

(4)    to pay increased benefits that result from a Plan amendment.

(ii)       Amount  Required  to  be  Distributed  by  Required  Beginning  Date.  The  amount  that  must  be  distributed  on  or
before the Participant’s Required Beginning Date (or, if the Participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions
are required to begin under Section 6.6(b)(i)) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment
need  not  be  made  until  the  end  of  the  next  payment  interval  even  if  that  payment  interval  ends  in  the  next  calendar  year.
Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All
of  the  Participant’s  benefit  accruals  as  of  the  last  day  of  the  first  Distribution  Calendar  Year  shall  be  included  in  the
calculation  of  the  amount  of  the  annuity  payments  for  payment  intervals  ending  on  or  after  the  Participant’s  Required
Beginning Date.

(iii)    Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Participant
in  a  calendar  year  after  the  first  Distribution  Calendar  Year  shall  be  distributed  beginning  with  the  first  payment  interval
ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

(c)    Requirements for Annuity Distributions that Commence During Participant’s Lifetime.

29

(i)    Joint Life Annuities Where the Beneficiary is Not the Participant’s Spouse. If the Participant’s interest is being
distributed  in  the  form  of  a  joint  and  survivor  annuity  for  the  joint  lives  of  the  Participant  and  a  non-spouse  Beneficiary,
annuity payments to be made on or after the Participant’s Required Beginning Date to the Designated Beneficiary after the
Participant’s death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would
have been payable to the Participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-6. If the Annuity Starting
Date precedes the year in which the Participant reaches age 70, the age difference to be used in determining the applicable
percentage referred to in the preceding sentence is reduced by the number of years that the Participant is younger than age 70
on his or her birthday in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the form of distribution combines a joint
and  survivor  annuity  for  the  joint  lives  of  the  Participant  and  a  non-spouse  Beneficiary  and  a  period  certain  annuity,  the
requirement in the preceding two sentences shall apply to annuity payments to be made to the Designated Beneficiary after
the expiration of the period certain.

(ii)       Period Certain Annuities.  Unless  the  Participant’s  spouse  is  the  sole  Designated  Beneficiary  and  the  form  of
distribution  is  a  period  certain  and  no  life  annuity,  the  period  certain  for  an  annuity  distribution  commencing  during  the
Participant’s lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table
set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-9 for the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the Annuity Starting
Date precedes the year in which the Participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution  period for the Participant is the
distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-9 plus the excess of 70
over  the  age  of  the  Participant  as  of  the  Participant’s  birthday  in  the  year  that  contains  the  Annuity  Starting  Date.  If  the
Participant’s spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no
life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the Participant’s applicable distribution period, as determined
under this Section 6.6(c)(ii), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse as
determined  under  the  Joint  and  Last  Survivor  Table  set  forth  in  Treas.  Reg.  §  1.401(a)(9)-9,  using  the  Participant’s  and
spouse’s attained ages as of the Participant’s and spouse’s birthdays in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting
Date.

(d)    Requirements For Minimum Distributions Where Participant Dies Before Date Distributions Begin.

(i)    Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distribution of his or her
interest begins and there is a Designated Beneficiary entitled to a death benefit under the Plan, the Participant’s entire interest
will be distributed, beginning

30

no later than the time described in Section 6.6(a)(ii)(A) or (B) over the life of the Designated Beneficiary or over a period
certain not exceeding:

(A)    unless the Annuity Starting Date is before the first Distribution Calendar Year, the life expectancy of the
Designated  Beneficiary  determined  using  the  Designated  Beneficiary’s  age  as  of  the  Designated  Beneficiary’s
birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the Participant’s death; or

(B)        if  the  Annuity  Starting  Date  is  before  the  first  Distribution  Calendar  Year,  the  life  expectancy  of  the
Designated  Beneficiary  determined  using  the  Designated  Beneficiary’s  age  as  of  the  Designated  Beneficiary’s
birthday in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date.

(ii)    No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date the distribution of his or her interest begins,
the  Participant’s  surviving  spouse  is  the  Participant’s  sole  Designated  Beneficiary,  and  the  surviving  spouse  dies  before
distributions  to  the  surviving  spouse  begin,  this  Section  6.6(d)  will  apply  as  if  the  surviving  spouse  were  the  Participant,
except that the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without regard to Section 6.6(a)(ii)(A).

(e)    Definitions.

(i)    Designated Beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the Contingent Annuitant under Section 2.1(i) of the
Plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4 of the Treasury
regulations.

(ii)    Distribution Calendar Year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. The first Distribution
Calendar  Year  is  the  calendar  year  immediately  preceding  the  calendar  year  that  contains  the  Participant’s  Required
Beginning Date.

(iii)    Life Expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)(9)-9.

(iv)    Required Beginning Date. April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which a Participant reaches age

70½.

Section 6.7    Distributions Pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (“QDRO”). Any benefit payable to an Alternate
Payee pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (“QDRO”), as those terms are defined in section 414(p) of the Code, shall
be  paid  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  QDRO.  If  permitted  under  the  terms  of  the  QDRO,  an  Alternate  Payee  may  elect
payment of benefits pursuant to a QDRO in the form of an Actuarially Equivalent lump sum distribution; provided, however that the
Alternate Payee must exercise this election within the 90 day period following the notice to the Alternate Payee that the domestic
relations order issued is a

31

QDRO.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  an  Alternate  Payee  may  not  elect  a  lump  sum  form  of  distribution  if  payment  of  the
Participant’s benefit has commenced prior to the Alternate Payee’s benefit election.

Section 76.8    Limited Lump Sum Election.

(a)    Eligibility. A Participant who has terminated employment with a vested Accrued Benefit, who is entitled to benefits as

of June 30, 2014, may elect to receive his benefit in a single lump sum payment, if the Participant satisfies the following criteria:

(i)    the Participant has neither been reemployed by the Employer nor commenced benefits under the Plan prior to the

date of distribution is made under this Section;

(ii)    the Participant's benefit is not subject to payment pursuant to Section 6.6 as a required minimum distribution or

Section 6.7 according to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order; and

(iii)    the Participant effectively returns a properly completed application for distribution under this Section, in such
form  and  manner  as  required  by  the  Committee,  during  the  period  that  begins  September  10,  2014  and  ends  October  24,
2014, or such other dates established by the Committee to provide an election period of no fewer than 30 days and applied in
a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.

(b)    Distribution to Beneficiary. If a Participant described in subsection (a) is deceased, and if such Participant's surviving
spouse or Contingent Annuitant is entitled to a future benefit under the Plan that has not yet commenced under the Plan prior to the
date of distribution under this Section, such surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant may elect to receive a distribution in the form
of a single lump sum payment, if the surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant effectively returns a properly completed application
for distribution under this Section no later than October 24, 2014, in such form and manner as required by the Committee.

(c)        Amount.  The  amount  of  the  single  lump  sum  payment  under  this  Section  shall  be  an  amount  equal  to  the  Actuarial
Equivalent present value of the Participant's vested Accrued Benefit which would otherwise be payable at the Participant's Normal
Retirement  Date,  as of November  1,  2014,  including  the  value  of any early  retirement  subsidy  if  the Participant  is eligible  for an
Early Retirement Date.

(d)    Early Commencement of Benefits and Additional Forms of Distribution for Certain Participants.

(i)    A Participant who satisfies the requirements of subsection (a) who is not yet eligible for a Normal Retirement

Date or an Early Retirement Date shall be eligible for a single lump sum payment under this Section.

32

(ii)    A Participant described in subsection (d)(i) shall also be eligible for the normal form of payment under Section
5.8, which for a married Participant shall be an annuity providing a reduced benefit for life with the continuation of either
50% or 75%, as elected, of such reduced benefit to his surviving spouse. The Actuarial Equivalent of such Accrued Benefit
shall be reduced in accordance with the factors set forth in Section 5.4 assuming the Participant would have otherwise begun
to receive his benefit upon attainment of age 55 or current age, if older, then further reduced using the "applicable mortality
table" under section 417(e)(3) of the Code and the "applicable interest rate" under section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the third
calendar month preceding the calendar year during which the Annuity Starting Date occurs to the extent his Annuity Starting
Date precedes his Early Retirement Date.

(e)    Spousal Consent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, any election under this Section by a married
Participant of any form of distribution, other than the normal form of benefit payable to him under Section 5.8, shall be subject to the
spousal consent and notification requirements described in Sections 6.2.

(f)    Time of Distribution. Any single lump sum distributions elected under this Section must commence on November 1,
2014 or as soon as administratively feasible thereafter to cause all single lump sum distributions under this Section to occur during
2014.

(g)    Closure of Limited Election Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing under this Section shall provide
any Participant, spouse, surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant the right to distribution in the form of a single lump sum payment
that does not, for any reason whatsoever, satisfy all of the terms and conditions set forth in this Section.

ARTICLE VII.
BENEFIT PAYMENTS

Section 7.1    Purchase of Annuities. All retirement income will be provided either through (i) the purchase of annuities from,
or other contractual arrangements with, an Insurance Company; or (ii) by direct payment from the Trust, as determined from time to
time by the Committee.

(a)    In the event that a Participant, his surviving spouse, or his Contingent Annuitant is entitled to a retirement income of less
than $10 monthly, that retirement income may be paid quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, in amounts equal to 3, 6 or 12 times the
monthly payment otherwise payable, respectively.

(b)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum present value of a Participant’s
vested retirement income is $5,000 or less on the date his distribution commences, such amount shall be paid to the Participant in a
single cash lump sum

33

without the Participant’s consent as soon as administratively feasible in accordance with the following:

(i)       If the Actuarial Equivalent  present value of a Participant’s  vested retirement  income is $1,000 or less and the
Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an “eligible retirement plan” in accordance with Section
7.2 of the Plan, the Participant’s retirement income shall be paid directly to the Participant in a cash lump sum.

(ii)       If the Actuarial  Equivalent  present value of a Participant’s  vested retirement  income is more than $1,000 but
does not exceed $5,000 and the Participant does not affirmatively elect to have such distribution paid directly to him or to an
“eligible  retirement  plan”  in  accordance  with  Section  7.2  of  the  Plan,  the  Participant’s  retirement  income  shall  be  paid
directly  to  an  individual  retirement  account  or  annuity  (an  “IRA”)  established  for  the  Participant  pursuant  to  a  written
agreement between the Committee and the provider of the IRA that meets the requirements of section 401(a)(31) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder. The Committee shall establish and maintain procedures to inform each Participant to whom
this Section 7.1(b)(ii) applies of the nature and operation of the IRA and the Participant’s investments therein, the fees and
expenses associated with the operation of the IRA, and the terms of the written agreement establishing such IRA on behalf of
the Participant.

Section 7.2    Direct Rollovers.

(a)    Eligibility. If one or more distributions from the Plan constitutes an “eligible rollover distribution” within the meaning
of sections 402(c)(2) and (4) of the Code, a distributee may elect to have all or a portion (but not less than $500) of the distribution
paid  directly  to  an  “eligible  retirement  plan.”  As  used  herein,  “eligible  retirement  plan”  means  an  individual  retirement  account
described in section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan
described in Section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in
section 401(a) of the Code that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution.  An eligible retirement plan also includes an
eligible  plan  under  section  457(b)  of  the  Code  that  is  maintained  by  a  state,  political  subdivision  of  a  state,  or  any  agency  or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and that agrees to account separately for amounts transferred into such
plan from this Plan. For any portion of an eligible rollover distribution consisting of after-tax contributions that are not includable in
gross income, an eligible retirement plan must agree to separately account for such portion. With respect to a distributee who is a
non-spouse beneficiary, “eligible retirement plan” means an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or
408(b)  of  the  Code  that  is  established  on  behalf  of  the  designated  beneficiary  and  that  will  be  treated  as  an  inherited  individual
retirement annuity pursuant to the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Code. Effective for distributions

34

made on or after January 1, 2008, a “qualified rollover contribution” as described in section 408A(e) of the Code may be made from
the  Plan  to  a  Roth  IRA  in  a  direct  rollover  subject  to  the  rules  and  provisions  set  forth  in  section  408A(e)  of  the  Code  and  any
regulations issued thereunder. The recipient may not elect to have portions of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to more
than  one  eligible  retirement  plan.  In  addition,  the  recipient  will  not  be  permitted  to  elect  a  direct  rollover  with  respect  to  eligible
rollover distributions that are reasonably expected to total less than $200 during the year.

(b)        Procedures.  The  Committee  shall  make  such  payment  upon  receipt  from  the  recipient  of  the  name  of  the  eligible
retirement  plan  to  which  such  payment  is  to  be  made,  a  representation  that  the  receiving  plan  is  an  “eligible  retirement  plan”  as
defined above, and such other information and/or documentation as the Committee may reasonably require to make such payment.

(c)    Failure to Elect. Except as otherwise provided under Section 7.1(b)(ii), if the recipient fails to elect whether or not a
distribution is to be paid in a direct rollover, the recipient will be deemed to have elected not to have any portion of the distribution
paid in a direct rollover.

(d)    Application. For purposes of this Section 7.2, “distributee” means a Participant or former Participant. In addition, the
Participant’s  or  former  Participant’s  surviving  spouse  or  former  spouse  who  is  the  alternate  payee  under  a  qualified  domestic
relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
For distributions after June 30, 2008, the term distributee also shall include a beneficiary who is not the spouse or former spouse of
the Participant or former Participant.

ARTICLE VIII.
VESTED BENEFITS IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

Section 8.1    Vesting. A Participant whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death or retirement, and who
has  completed  five  or  more  Years  of  Service  at  the  date  of  his  termination  of  employment  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  a  monthly
retirement income beginning on his Normal Retirement Date equal to his normal retirement income under the Plan as in effect as of
the date of his termination of employment, based on his full and partial Years of Service at such date of termination of employment.
However,  if  he  makes  written  application  to  his  Employer  at  least  two  months  in  advance,  such  a  Participant  shall  be  entitled  to
receive his benefit, reduced as provided in Section 5.4, beginning with the first day of any calendar month following the month in
which the sum of the years of his attained age and his completed Years of Service is at least 70, provided he has then attained at least
age 55. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall automatically become 100% vested on the date he reaches age 65.

35

Section 8.2    Payment of Vested Termination Benefit.

(a)    Forms of Payment. A Participant entitled to benefits under Section 8.1, shall, for purposes of Section 6.1(a) and Section
6.3,  be  treated  as  though  the  date  on  which  his  benefits  under  Section  8.1  are  to  begin  were  his  actual  retirement  date.  Such  a
Participant may elect any of the elective survivor benefits provided by Section 6.4.

(b)    Termination Benefit For Certain Union Employees. A union Participant hired on or after January 1, 2001 but before
January  1, 2006 who terminates  employment  with a vested  Accrued  Benefit  on or after January 1, 2006, may elect to receive  his
benefit at any time in one of the following payment forms:

(i)       a  single  lump  sum  payment  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  Actuarial  Equivalent  present  value  of  the  Participant’s
vested  Accrued  Benefit  which  would  otherwise  be  payable  at  the  Participant’s  Normal  Retirement  Date,  however,  if  the
Participant is eligible for an Early Retirement Date at the time he terminates employment, the lump sum payment will reflect
the value of the early retirement subsidy; or

(ii)    a single life annuity which shall be the Actuarial Equivalent value of the single lump sum described in (i) above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if payment to the Participant occurred later than the close of the second Plan Year following the Plan
Year  in  which  such  Termination  of  Employment  occurred  and  such  Participant  is  reemployed  by  the  Employer,  the  Participant’s
Accrued  Benefit  shall  be  restored  upon  reemployment  without  the  requirement  that  he  make  restoration  contributions,  provided,
however  his  subsequent  Accrued  Benefit,  if  any,  payable  upon  his  subsequent  Termination  of  Employment  shall  be  offset  by  the
Accrued Benefit attributable to the prior distribution.

Section 8.3    Failure to Vest. A Participant whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death or retirement
and who has not completed  at least five Years of Service  at the time of his termination  of employment  for any reason other than
death or retirement shall not be entitled to any benefits under the Plan. Amounts forfeited under this provision shall be applied to
reduce the obligation of the Company and its Designated Subsidiaries to contribute under the Plan.

ARTICLE IX.
RE-EMPLOYMENT AND BREAKS-IN-SERVICE

Section 9.1        Re-employment  before  July  1,  1976.  If  a  Participant  who  terminated  employment  with  the  Employer  is  re-
employed before July 1, 1976, he shall be considered a new Employee for purposes of this Plan. In determining the amount of his
retirement income as a new Employee, however, if the Participant has vested retirement income benefits under Section 8.1 due

36

to  prior  service,  his  benefit  shall  be  computed  under  Section  5.2  as  if  his  service  was  continuous.  The  benefit  payable  to  such
Participant  as  a  new  Employee  shall  be  the  excess  of  the  benefit  so  computed  over  the  benefit  payable  on  account  of  that  prior
service, without regard to any actuarial reductions to which that prior service benefit may have been subject.

Section 9.2    Re-employment after June 30, 1976 and before July 1, 1985. If a Participant terminates employment with the
Employer  and  is re-employed  after  June  30,  1976  and  before  July  1,  1985,  all  of  his  Years  of  Service  shall  be  recognized  for  all
purposes  of  the  Plan  unless,  at  the  time  of  his  return  to  employment,  the  period  of  his  absence  was  at  least  a  one  year  Break-in-
Service, in which event:

(a)    Years of Service occurring before the Break-in-Service shall not thereafter be recognized for any purpose of the Plan

unless, immediately following the Break-in-Service, he completed one Year of Service; and,

(b)        if,  before  the  Break-in-Service,  the  Participant  had  no  vested  retirement  income  benefit  under  Section  8.1,  Years  of
Service before the  Break-in-Service shall not thereafter be  recognized for any purpose of  the Plan unless the number  of Years of
Service before the Break-in-Service exceeds the number of consecutive years of Break-in-Service.

Section  9.3        Re-employment  after  June  30,  1985.  If  a  Participant  terminates  employment  with  the  Employer  and  is  re-
employed after June 30, 1985, all of his Years of Service shall be recognized for all purposes of the Plan unless, at the time of his
return to employment, the period of his absence was at least five consecutive Breaks-in-Service, in which event:

(a)    Years of Service occurring before those Breaks-in-Service shall not thereafter be recognized for any purpose of the Plan

unless, immediately following those Breaks-in-Service, he has completed one Year of Service; and,

(b)    if, before those Breaks-in-Service, the Participant had no vested retirement income benefit under Section 8.1, Years of
Service before those Breaks-in-Service shall not thereafter be recognized for any purpose of the Plan unless the number of Years of
Service before those Breaks-in-Service exceeds the greater of five or the number of consecutive Breaks-in-Service.

Section  10.4        General.  Anything  herein  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  a  Break-in-Service  shall  not  reduce  any
Participant’s  vested  retirement  income  benefit,  determined  immediately  before  the  Break-in-Service,  nor  shall  Section  9.2  or
Sections 9.3 or 9.4 be interpreted to restore credit for Years of Service disregarded by reason of some earlier Breaks(s)-in-Service.

ARTICLE X.
VETERANS’ RE-EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS

37

Section 10.1    Qualified Military Service. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits
and  service  credit  with  respect  to  Qualified  Military  Service  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  section  414(u)  of  the  Code  as
summarized below:

(a)    Crediting Service.

(i)    An Employee re-employed by the Employer in accordance with Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the United States Code
shall  be  treated  as  not  having  incurred  a  Break-in-Service  with  the  Employer  by  reason  of  such  Employee’s  period  of
Qualified Military Service.

(ii)    Upon re-employment by the Employer in accordance with Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the United States Code, an
Employee’s period of Qualified Military Service shall be deemed service with the Employer for purposes of determining the
vested percentage of the Employee’s account.

(b)    Earnings. An Employee who is in Qualified Military Service shall be treated as receiving Earnings from the Employer

during such period of Qualified Military Service equal to:

(i)        the  Earnings  the  Employee  would  have  received  during  such  period  if  the  Employee  were  not  in  Qualified
Military Service, determined based on the rate of pay the Employee would have received from the Employer but for absence
during the period of Qualified Military Service; or

(ii)        if  the  Earnings  the  Employee  would  have  received  during  such  period  was  not  reasonably  certain,  the
Employee’s average Earnings from the Employer during the 12-month period immediately preceding the Qualified Military
Service (or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding the Qualified Military Service).

Section 10.2    Death While In Qualified Military Service. Effective for deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2007, to the
extent required by section 401(a)(37) of the Code and regulations or other guidance issued thereunder, the survivors of a Participant
who dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in section 414(u) of the Code) shall be eligible for any additional
benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) that would have been provided under the Plan
if the Participant had resumed employment and immediately thereafter terminated employment due to death.

ARTICLE XI.
PLAN ADMINISTRATION

38

Section 11.1    Fiduciary Responsibility. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, which shall be the Plan’s “named
fiduciary”  and  “administrator,”  as  those  terms  are  defined  by  ERISA,  and  its  agent  designated  to  receive  service  of  process.  All
matters  relating  to  the  administration  of  the  Plan,  including  the  duties  imposed  upon  the  Plan  administrator  by  law,  except  those
duties relating to the control or management of Plan assets, shall be the responsibility of the Committee. All matters relating to the
control and management of Plan assets shall, except to the extent delegated in accordance with the trust agreement, be the sole and
exclusive responsibility of the Trustee. The Committee shall administer the Plan for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their
Beneficiaries.

Section 11.2    Appointment and Removal of Committee. The Committee shall consist of at least three persons who shall be
appointed and may be removed by the Board of Directors. Persons appointed to the Committee may be, but need not be, employees
of  the  Employer.  Any  Committee  member  may  resign  by  giving  written  notice  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  which  notice  shall  be
effective 30 days after delivery. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Committee member who is an Employee of the Employer shall
be  deemed  to  have  resigned  from  the  Committee  effective  upon  his  termination  of  employment.  A  Committee  member  may  be
removed by the Board of Directors by written notice to such Committee member, which notice shall be effective upon delivery. The
Board of Directors shall promptly select a successor following the resignation or removal of the Committee member, if necessary to
maintain a Committee of at least three members.

Section  11.3        Compensation  and  Expenses  of  Committee.  Members  of  the  Committee  who  are  Employees  shall  serve
without  compensation.  Members  of  the  Committee  who  are  not  Employees  may  be  paid  reasonable  compensation  for  services
rendered  to  the  Plan.  Such  compensation,  if  any,  and  all  ordinary  and  necessary  expenses  of  the  Committee  shall  be  paid  by  the
Employer.

Section 11.4    Committee Procedures. The Committee may enact such rules and regulations for the conduct of its business
and for the administration of the Plan as it may deem desirable. The Committee may act either at meetings at which a majority of its
members are present or by a writing signed by a majority of its members without the holding of a meeting. Records shall be kept of
the actions of the Committee. No member of the Committee shall act on any matter in which he alone is personally interested under
the  Plan.  Except  as  may  otherwise  be  provided  by  the  Plan,  the  Committee  shall  have  all  powers  necessary  to  accomplish  the
purposes of the Plan including, but not by way of limitation, the following:

(a)        To  interpret  the  provisions  of  the  Plan  and  to  decide  any  dispute  that  may  arise  regarding  the  rights  of  Participants
thereunder. Any such determinations shall apply uniformly to all persons similarly situated and shall be binding and conclusive upon
all interested persons.

39

(b)        To  determine  all  questions  affecting  the  eligibility  of  any  Employee  to  participate  in  the  Plan,  including,  without
limitation,  to  determine  whether  any  individual  performing  services  as  an  independent  contractor  is  an  Employee  eligible  to
participate in the Plan and, if so, for what period.

(c)    To compute the amount of benefits payable hereunder to any Participant.

(d)    To authorize the application of funds to provide the retirement income benefits of Participants, surviving spouses and

Contingent Annuitants.

(e)    To appoint an actuary who shall make all actuarial computations required in the administration of the Plan, including

those necessary to enable the Company and its Designated subsidiaries to comply with the provisions of Section 12.1.

(f)        To  employ  such  accountants,  attorneys,  consultants  and  other  advisors  as  may  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  the
administration of the Plan and to delegate authority to such one or more members of the Committee or such other Employee of an
appropriate Employer as the Committee shall determine.

(g)        To  prescribe  from  time  to  time,  with  the  advice  of  an  actuary,  such  actuarial  assumptions  as  are  necessary  for  the
operation  of  the  Plan.  The  factors  and  assumptions  embodied  in  Tables  1  through  5  may  be  changed  only  by  Plan  amendment
pursuant to Section 16.1(a).

(h)    To authorize an amendment to the Plan extending the Plan to a group or groups of acquired employees in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in any acquisition agreement previously approved by the Board of Directors, provided that no
service shall be credited for benefit accrual purposes prior to the date on which the Plan is extended by the Company to the group or
groups of acquired employees, except as specifically provided in the agreement approved by the Board.

Section 11.5    Delegation and Allocation of Responsibility. The Committee, by unanimous action in writing, may delegate
any Plan administrative responsibility to any employee of the Employer and may allocate any of its responsibilities to one or more
members  of  the  Committee.  In  the  event  of  any  such  delegation  or  allocation  the  Committee  shall  establish  procedures  for  the
thorough  and  frequent  review  of  the  performance  of  such  duties.  Persons  to  whom  responsibilities  have  been  delegated  may  not
delegate to others any discretionary authority or discretionary control with respect to the management or administration of the Plan.

Section  11.6        Indemnification.  The  Company  and  Designated  Subsidiaries  shall,  to  the  full  extent  permitted  by  law,
indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and each other director, officer or employee of the Company or of a
Designated Subsidiary acting as a “fiduciary” of the Plan, as defined in section 3(21) of ERISA or any corresponding provisions of

40

successor  laws,  against  any  liability  or  loss,  including,  without  limitation,  attorneys’  fees  and  other  expenses,  excise  taxes,
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, reasonably incurred by such “fiduciary” in connection with any claim (or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof) arising out of or based upon an alleged breach of fiduciary duty, provided that he acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Plan and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, and further provided that the “fiduciary” shall have taken
the steps required under any applicable insurance policy to preserve the coverage afforded by such insurance with respect to such
liability or loss. If any action is brought against a “fiduciary” in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company or a
Designated  Subsidiary  he  shall  promptly  notify  the  Company  in  writing  of  the  institution  of  such  action,  and  the  Company  shall
assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel and payment of expenses, to the extent that the same is not
assumed by the insurance company. The “fiduciary” shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by him.

Section 11.7    Claims Procedure. The Committee shall administer a claims procedure as follows:

(a)        Initial Claim.  A  Participant,  surviving  spouse  or  Contingent  Annuitant  (a  “Claimant”),  or  the  Claimant’s  authorized
representative, who believes himself entitled to benefits under the Plan and who does not begin to receive those benefits within 120
days after the claimed benefit date may claim those benefits by submitting to his Employer within 90 days after the expiration of that
120 day period, a written notification of his claim of right to such benefits. A claim for benefits must be made in accordance with the
procedures established by the Committee. Except for benefits paid pursuant to the small benefit cash out provisions of Section 7.1,
no  benefit  shall  be  paid  under  the  Plan  until  a  proper  claim  for  benefits  has  been  submitted  to  the  Committee.  The  Participant’s
Employer shall forward that claim to the Committee within five business days after it is filed.

(b)    Procedure for Review. The Committee shall establish administrative processes and safeguards designed to ensure and to
verify  that  benefit  claim  determinations  are  made  in  accordance  with  the  Plan  document  and  that,  where  appropriate,  the  Plan
provisions have been applied consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.

(c)    Claim Denial Procedure. In the event that the initial claim is wholly or partially denied, the Committee shall, within 90
days (or in special cases, and upon prior written notice to the claimant, 180 days) of the receipt of the claim, provide written notice
informing  the  Claimant  of:  (i)  the  reason  or  reasons  for  the  denial,  (ii)  the  specific  reference  to  the  Plan  provisions  on  which  the
denial was based, (iii) any additional information which may be necessary to perfect the claim, with reasons therefor, and (iv) the
procedure for reviewing the denial of the claim, including a

41

description  of  the  time  limits  applicable  to  the  Plan’s  review  procedures  and  a  statement  of  the  Claimant’s  right  to  bring  a  legal
action following an adverse benefit determination on review.

(d)       Appeal Procedure.  In  the  case  of  an  adverse  benefit  determination,  the  Claimant  or  his  representative  shall  have  the
opportunity to appeal to the Committee for review provided the Claimant submits a proper written application for appeal within 90
days of receipt of the notification of the adverse benefit determination. Failure to submit a proper application for appeal within such
90 day period will cause such claim to be permanently denied. The Claimant shall have a right to: (i) review all pertinent documents
and  submit  comments  in  writing,  and  (ii)  receive,  upon  request  and  free  of  charge,  reasonable  access  to,  and  copies  of,  all
documents,  records  and  other  information  relevant  to  the  claim  for  benefits.  The  Committee’s  review  shall  take  into  account  all
comments,  documents,  records  and  other  information  submitted  by  the  Claimant  relating  to  the  claim,  without  regard  to  whether
such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.

(e)        Decision  on  Appeal.  No  later  than  60  days  after  its  receipt  of  the  request  for  review,  the  Committee  shall  render  a
decision  in  writing.  If  special  circumstances  require  extension,  and  upon  prior  written  notice  to  the  claimant,  the  Committee’s
decision may be given within 120 days after receipt of the request for review. In the case of an adverse benefit determination on
appeal, the written notice shall include: (i) the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination, (ii) the specific reference to
the Plan provision(s) on which the denial is based, (iii) a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of
charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim, and (iv) a statement of
the Claimant’s right to bring a legal action.

(f)    Litigation. In order to operate and administer the claims procedure in a timely and efficient manner, any Claimant whose
appeal with respect to a claim for benefits has been denied, and who desires to commence a legal action with respect to such claim,
must commence such action in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of notification of such denial. Failure to
file such action by the prescribed time will forever bar the commencement of such actions.

Section 11.8    Plan Expenses. All fees of actuaries, accountants, attorneys, consultants or other advisors, and other expenses
of  the  Plan,  shall,  as  determined  by  the  Committee,  be  paid  from  the  Fund  or  allocated  among  the  Company  and  its  Designated
Subsidiaries.

Section 12.1    Contributions.

ARTICLE XII.
CONTRIBUTIONS

(a)    Contributions to Meet Funding Standards. The Company and its Designated Subsidiaries, shall each contribute to the

Plan, by deposit with the Insurance Company or with the

42

Trustee or other fiduciary of any trust or other fund which may be established by the Company to hold, manage and invest amounts
contributed  under  the  Plan  by  the  Company  or  its  Designated  Subsidiaries,  an  amount  which  shall  not  be  less  than  the  amount
necessary  to  prevent  an  accumulated  funding  deficiency,  as  defined  in  section  412  of  the  Code,  section  302  of  ERISA,  or
corresponding provisions of successor laws, with respect to those of its Employees who are Participants in the Plan.

(b)    Quarterly Installments. The Company and its Designated Subsidiaries shall endeavor to make four equal payments to the
Fund on October 15, January 15 and April 15 of the Plan Year for which such payment is due and on July 15 of the next Plan Year.
The amount of each payment shall equal the “applicable percentage” of the lesser of:

(i)    90 percent of the amount necessary to prevent an accumulated funding deficiency for the Plan Year, as defined in

section 412 of the Code, or

(ii)        100  percent  of  the  amount  necessary  to  prevent  an  accumulated  funding  deficiency  for  the  immediately

preceding Plan Year.

(iii)    The amount of each quarterly installment determined under this Section 12.1 shall be increased to the extent
required under section 412(m) of the Code, if the Plan has any liabilities for “unpredictable contingent event benefits,” within
the meaning of section 412(I)(7)(B)(ii), during the Plan Year.

(c)        Additional  Contributions.  Payment  of  any  difference  between  the  amount  of  the  Company’s  and  Designated
Subsidiary’s contribution to the Fund as determined under Section 12.1(a) and the amount paid into the Fund under Section 12.1(b)
shall be made within the time prescribed by the Code as the time within which contributions must be made in order to constitute (A)
a credit to the Plan’s minimum funding standard account (or alternative funding standard account) for the Plan Year to which the
contribution relates, and (B) an allowable Federal income tax deduction for the taxable year for which the contribution is made.

(d)    Special Rule; Return of Contributions. It is intended that the Plan and the Fund shall continue to qualify under section
401(a) of the Code and that contributions are conditioned upon their deductibility under section 404 of the Code. Therefore, Section
12.1 shall be subject to the following provisions:

(i)    The entire contribution attributable to any Plan Year as to which deductibility is disallowed shall be returned to
the  Employer,  to  the  extent  of  the  amount  of  the  disallowance,  within  one  year  after  the  disallowance.  Nondeductible
contributions that are treated as de minimis pursuant to Revenue Procedure 90-49 shall be returned to the Employer within
one year of the date of the Plan actuary’s certification of such non-deductibility.

43

(ii)    In the case of a contribution which is made in whole or in part by reason of a mistake of fact, so much of such
contribution as is attributable to the mistake of fact shall be returnable to the Employer upon demand by the Committee, upon
presentation  of  evidence  of  the  mistake  of  fact  to  the  Insurance  Company  and  of  calculations  as  to  the  impact  of  such
mistake.  Demand  and  repayment  must  be  effectuated  within  one  year  after  the  payment  of  the  contribution  to  which  the
mistake applies.

Income  and  gains  attributable  to  the  excess  contributions  may  not  be  recovered  by  the  Employer.  Losses  attributable  to  such
contribution shall reduce the amount the Employer may recover.

Section 12.2        Management  of Funds.  All  funds  to  provide  the  benefits  of  the  Plan  shall  be  deposited  with  the  Insurance
Company  or  the  Trustee  to  be  held,  managed  and  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Insurance  Contract,  the  Trust
Agreement  or  any  agreement  with  any  Investment  Manager.  At  no  time  and  under  no  circumstances  may  the  funds  or  any  part
thereof or income therefrom prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities for benefits under the Plan be used for or diverted to purposes
other than the exclusive benefit of Participants, surviving spouses or Contingent Annuitants under the Plan. No one shall have any
interest in or right to any part of the assets or the earnings of the funds, except as and to the extent expressly provided in the Plan.

ARTICLE XIII.
MISCELLANEOUS

Section  13.1        Liability  of  the  Company.  The  Company  and  its  Designated  Subsidiaries  shall  have  no  liability  for  the
payment  of  benefits  under  the  Plan,  except  to  make  the  contributions  required  under  Section  12.1,  nor  shall  the  Company  or  any
Designated  Subsidiary  have  any  liability  for  the  administration  of  the  funds  or  assets  paid  over  to  the  Insurance  Company,  the
Trustee  or  any  Investment  Manager,  and  each  Participant,  surviving  spouse  and  Contingent  Annuitant  shall  look  solely  to  the
Insurance Company, or Trustee for any payments or benefits under the Plan.

Section 13.2    Non-Alienation of Benefits. No benefits payable under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation,
assignment  or  pledge  and  any  attempt  to  anticipate,  assign  or  pledge  the  same  shall  be  void;  and  no  such  benefit  shall  be  in  any
manner  liable  for  or  subject  to  the  debts,  contracts,  liabilities,  engagements  or  torts  of  any  Participant,  surviving  spouse  or
Contingent Annuitant. This Section 13.2 shall not preclude the Insurance Company or the Trustee from complying with the terms of
a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section 414(p) of the Code, or applicable provisions of successor laws.

Section 13.3    Facility of Payment. If any Participant, surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant is, in the judgment of either
the Insurance Company or the Trustee, legally, physically or mentally incapable of personally receiving or receipting for any benefit
due hereunder, the

44

Insurance Company or the Trustee may make payment thereof to such other person, persons or institutions who, in the opinion of the
Insurance Company or Trustee, are then maintaining or have custody of such Participant, surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant
until claim is made by the duly appointed guardian or other legal representative of such Participant, surviving spouse or Contingent
Annuitant. Such payment shall constitute a full discharge of the liability of the Insurance Company or Trustee, to the extent thereof.
Upon notice to the Insurance Company or Trustee of the appointment of a guardian or other legal representative of such Participant,
surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant, the Insurance Company or Trustee shall thereafter pay only to said guardian or other legal
representative.

Section 13.4    Limitation on Benefits. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, the annual benefit, derived from
Company, Designated Subsidiary or former Designated Subsidiary contributions, payable to any Participant under this Plan and any
other  defined  benefit  pension  plan  maintained  by  the  Company  or  any  Designated  Subsidiary  may  not  exceed  the  lesser  of  the
amount  determined  under  the  primary  limit  or,  effective  until  January  1,  2000,  the  combined  limit  provisions  of  Article  C  of
Appendix 2, provided that in applying the combined limit any necessary reduction shall first be made in computing the benefit to be
provided under this Plan.

Section 13.5    Right to Terminate Employment. The establishment or continuance of the Plan and of any Insurance Contract,
Trust, or any contract with any Investment Manager, shall not confer upon any Participant the right to be continued in the employ of
the Company  or of any Designated  Subsidiary and this Plan shall in no way restrict the right of the Company or of a Designated
Subsidiary to terminate the employment of any employee, whether or not a Participant.

ARTICLE XIV.
TERMINATION OF THE PLAN - DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS

Section 14.1    Order of Priorities. The Plan as a whole may be terminated at any time by the Board of Directors. In the event
of such complete termination, or if for any reason the Plan is partially terminated the Accrued Benefits of all Participants affected by
such  complete  or  partial  termination  shall,  to  the  extent  then  funded,  become  100%  vested.  In  the  event  of  a  complete  or  partial
termination of the Plan, or upon a complete discontinuance of contributions required by Section 12.1, funds then held under the Plan
for  the  benefit  of  affected  Participants,  surviving  spouse  and  Contingent  Annuitants  shall  be  allocated  to  or  for  the  benefit  of  the
affected  Participants,  surviving  spouse  and  Contingent  Annuitants  in  the  order  set  forth  below  and  in  the  manner  and  amount
provided in Sections 14.2 through 14.3.

(a)        There  shall  first  be  credited  to  each  Participant  the  amount,  if  any,  necessary  to  provide  that  portion  of  his  benefit

derived from his own contributions.

45

(b)    There shall then be credited to each Participant, surviving spouse and Contingent Annuitant whose benefit has been in
pay  status  for  at  least  three  years  as  of  the  Plan’s  termination  date,  or  whose  benefit  would  have  been  in  pay  status  during  such
period if the Participant had retired, and his benefit had begun immediately prior thereto, the amount, if any, necessary to provide the
lowest level of benefit to which he was, or would have been, entitled under the provisions of the Plan in effect during the five year
period ending on the Plan’s termination date.

(c)        There  shall  then  be  credited  to  each  Participant,  surviving  spouse  and  Contingent  Annuitant  whose  vested  Accrued
Benefit  has  not  been  fully  provided  under  (a)  or  (b)  above,  the  amount,  if  any,  necessary  to  provide  that  portion  of  his  vested
Accrued Benefit, determined immediately prior to the Plan’s termination, which does not exceed the lesser of:

(i)    a monthly annuity equal to the Participant’s average monthly gross income during the five consecutive calendar

years during which his gross income received from the Company was highest; or

(ii)    $750 multiplied by a percentage computed by dividing the Social Security Act contribution and benefit base at

the time the Plan terminates by that base as in effect during 1974.

The amount allocated under this Section 14.1(c) shall be determined without regard to whether the Participant would be considered a
“substantial owner” within the meaning of section 4022(b)(6) of ERISA, or any corresponding provisions of successor laws.

(d)    There shall then be credited to each Participant, surviving spouse and Contingent Annuitant whose benefit has not been
provided  under  (a)  or  (b)  above,  the  amount,  if  any,  necessary  to  provide  the  portion  of  his  vested  Accrued  Benefit,  determined
immediately prior to the Plan’s termination, not provided under (c) above. If the Plan has been amended during that five year period,
the allocation of assets to benefits described in (d) which are attributable  to such amendments shall be made on the basis of such
amendments in the order in which they became effective.

(e)        Finally,  there  shall  be  credited  to  each  Participant,  surviving  spouse  and  Contingent  Annuitant  the  amount,  if  any,

necessary to provide any benefit to which he is entitled under the Plan to the extent such benefit has not been provided above.

(f)    If the assets of the Plan are insufficient to provide in full the benefits described in (a), (b) or (c) above, the assets shall be
allocated  pro  rata  among  all  Participants,  surviving  spouses  and  Contingent  Annuitants  in  the  affected  group  on  the  basis  of  the
present value, as of the Plan’s termination date, of their respective benefits. If the assets of the Plan are insufficient to provide all
benefits described in (d) (after all benefits described in (a) through (c) have been provided) those assets will first be allocated to any
nonforfeitable benefits described in (d) under the Plan as in effect five years prior to the termination date, and thereafter to other
benefits described in (d).

46

Section 14.2    Method of Allocation. The allocation of funds held under the Plan shall, with the advice of the actuary, be
calculated by the Committee on the foregoing basis as of the date on which the Plan is discontinued or contributions are completely
discontinued. When the calculations have been completed, and the Company shall have obtained such governmental approvals of the
allocation of Plan assets, including approval by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, as the Committee may determine to be
necessary,  such  funds  shall  be  allocated  to  or  for  the  benefit  of  the  respective  Participants,  surviving  spouses  and  Contingent
Annuitants of each class in the order, and to the extent, stated in Section 14.1 above, except that (a) no Participant, surviving spouse
or  Contingent  Annuitant  shall  be  entitled  to  a  share  of  any  such  funds  greater  than  the  actuarial  value,  at  the  date  of  such
discontinuance of the Plan or contributions, of the total retirement income to which such Participant, surviving spouse or Contingent
Annuitant would have been entitled under the Plan at the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date pursuant to Sections 5.2, 5.6, and 5.7
had the Plan or contributions not been discontinued and had such Participant continued in employment until his Normal Retirement
Date  without  change  in  Final  Average  Earnings,  and  (b)  except  to  the  extent  required  to  comply  with  Title  IV  of  ERISA,  or  any
corresponding provisions of any successor laws, no assets previously allocated to the benefit of any Participant, surviving spouse or
Contingent Annuitant shall be reallocated. The Committee shall have the right to determine whether the distribution shall be applied
to purchase retirement income under any Insurance Contract or paid in cash. Any assets remaining after the distributions described in
this Section 14.2 have been completed shall be allocated among, and returned to, the Company and its Designated Subsidiaries on
the basis determined by the Committee, with the advice of the actuary.

Section 14.3    Restricted Benefits.

(a)    In the event of termination of the Plan, the benefit due any Participant or former Participant who is one of the 25 highest

paid Participants shall be restricted in the manner set forth in this Section 14.3(a).

(i)        Benefit  Restriction.  The  annual  payments  to  a  Participant  described  above  in  this  Section  14.3(a)  shall  be
restricted to an amount equal to the payments that would be made on behalf of such Participant under a single life annuity
that  is  the  Actuarial  Equivalent  of  the  sum  of  the  Participant’s  Accrued  Benefit  and  the  Participant’s  other  benefits,  as
described below.

(ii)    Definition of “Benefits”. For purposes of this Section 14.3(a), the term “benefits” shall include loans in excess of
the  amounts  set  forth  in  section  72(p)(2)(A)  of  the  Code,  any  periodic  income,  any  withdrawal  values  payable  to  a  living
Participant, and any death benefits not provided for by insurance on the Participant’s life.

(iii)    Restrictions Not Applicable. The restrictions described in this Section 14.3(a) shall not apply if:

47

(A)    after payment to a Participant described in Section 14.3(a) of all benefits described in Section 14.3(a)(ii),
the value of the Plan assets equals or exceeds 110% of the value of the current liabilities as defined in section 412(1)
(7) of the Code for Plan Years beginning prior to January 1, 2008, and for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1,
2008, the funding target (as defined under section 430 of the Code), or

(B)    the value of the benefits described in Section 14.3(a)(ii) for a Participant described in this Section 14.3(a)

is less than 1% of the value of current liabilities.

(b)    Any excess reserves arising by application of the provisions of Section 14.3(a), shall be used for the benefit of the other

Participants, surviving spouses and Contingent Annuitants in accordance with Section 14.1.

(c)    The provisions of Section 14.3(a) shall not restrict the purchase in full of retirement income benefits, including vested
deferred benefits, called for by the Plan for any retired Participant, surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant while the Plan is in full
effect and its full current costs have been met; nor shall it restrict the purchase of any retirement income benefits withheld for a prior
year (under the foregoing provisions) after all deficits for all prior years and full current costs have been met.

Section 14.4    Severance of a Subsidiary. If at any time any Designated Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary or a Designated
Subsidiary prior to termination of the Plan, the Employees of that Subsidiary shall then cease to be Participants in the Plan, and shall
accrue no further benefits hereunder.

ARTICLE XV.
GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL

Anything  in  this  Plan  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  the  adoption  of  the  Plan  and  any  amendment  thereto  shall  be
conditioned upon the receipt of (A) a determination from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to the effect that the Plan qualifies
under  the  applicable  provisions  of  the  Code  and  (B)  any  required  approval  or  authorization  under  any  other  applicable  statute  or
regulation. Effective February 1, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service has discontinued the determination letter application program
such that (A) shall no longer apply.

ARTICLE XVI.
AMENDMENTS

48

Section 16.1    Amendment.

(a)    The Company and its Designated Subsidiaries hope and expect to continue the Plan indefinitely, but reserve the right to
suspend  or  discontinue  the  Plan,  or  to  reduce  or  discontinue  contributions  hereunder.  The  Plan  may  be  amended  at  any  time  and
from time to time by the Board of Directors or its properly authorized delegate. In addition, the Committee shall have the right to
amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, provided that any such amendment is either required by law or
does not materially increase the cost of the Plan. No amendment shall divest any vested interest of any Participant or beneficiary,
and  no  amendment  shall  be  effective  unless  the  Plan  continues  to  be  for  the  exclusive  benefit  of  the  Participants  and  their
beneficiaries.  In  addition,  no  amendment  shall decrease  a  Participant’s vested  interest,  eliminate  or  reduce  any  benefit  subsidy  or
early  retirement  benefit,  or  eliminate  any  optional  form  of  benefit  except  in  accordance  with  sections  411(d)(6)  and  412(d)(2)
(section 412(c)(8) for Plan Years beginning before July 1, 2008) of the Code.

(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 16.1(a), any modification or amendment of the Plan, the Insurance Contract, any
trust or other fund established under the Plan, or any provision thereof, may be made, retroactively if necessary, which the Company
by action of the Board of Directors or its designee shall deem necessary or appropriate in order to comply with any applicable statute
or regulations, including but not limited to the Code and the regulations thereunder.

Section 16.2    Merger, Consolidation or Transfer of Assets or Liabilities. The Company and its Designated Subsidiaries also
reserve the right to merge or consolidate this Plan with any other pension plan qualified under applicable provisions of the Code, or
to transfer any or all Plan assets or liabilities to any other pension plan qualified under applicable provisions of the Code, provided
that, notwithstanding this Section 16.2, no such merger, consolidation or transfer of Plan assets or liabilities shall occur unless the
benefit  to  which  each  affected  Participant,  surviving  spouse  or  Contingent  Annuitant  would  be  entitled  in  the  event  of  a  plan
termination immediately after such merger, consolidation or transfer will be at least equal to the benefit to which such Participant,
surviving  spouse  or  Contingent  Annuitant  would  be  entitled  under  this  Plan  if  it  terminated  immediately  prior  to  such  merger,
consolidation or transfer.

ARTICLE XVII.
LIMITATIONS APPLICABLE IF THE PLAN'S ADJUSTED FUNDING
TARGET ATTAINMENT PERCENTAGE IS LESS THAN 80%
OR IF THE PLAN SPONSOR IS IN BANKRUPTCY

Section 17.1    Limitations Applicable If the Plan's Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage Is Less Than 80%, But

Not Less Than 60%. Notwithstanding any other provisions of

49

the Plan, if the Plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a Plan Year is less than 80% (or would be less than 80% to
the extent described in Section 17.1(b) below) but is not less than 60%, then the limitations set forth in this Section 17.1 apply.

(a)    50% Limitation on Single Sum Payments, Other Accelerated Forms of Distribution, and Other Prohibited Payments. A
Participant or beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of benefit
that includes a prohibited  payment  with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable  section 436 measurement  date, and the
Plan  shall  not  make  any  payment  for  the  purchase  of  an  irrevocable  commitment  from  an  insurer  to  pay  benefits  or  any  other
payment  or  transfer  that  is  a  prohibited  payment,  unless  the  present  value  of  the  portion  of  the  benefit  that  is  being  paid  in  a
prohibited payment does not exceed the lesser of:

(i)        50%  of  the  present  value  of  the  benefit  payable  in  the  optional  form  of  benefit  that  includes the  prohibited

payment; or

(ii)        100%  of  the  PBGC  maximum  benefit  guarantee  amount  (as  defined  in  section  1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(C)  of  the

Treasury Regulations).

The limitation set forth in this Section 17.1(a) does not apply to any payment of a benefit which under section 411(a)(11) of
the  Code  may  be  immediately  distributed  without  the  consent  of  the  Participant.  If  an  optional  form  of  benefit  that  is  otherwise
available  under the terms of the Plan is not available  to a Participant  or beneficiary  as of the annuity  starting  date because of the
application of the requirements of this Section 17.1(a), the Participant or beneficiary is permitted to elect to bifurcate the benefit into
unrestricted  and  restricted  portions  (as  described  in  section  1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(D)  of  the  Treasury  Regulations).  The  Participant  or
beneficiary  may  also  elect  any  other  optional  form  of  benefit  otherwise  available  under  the  Plan  at  that  annuity  starting  date  that
would satisfy the 50%/PBGC maximum benefit guarantee amount limitation described in this Section 17.1(a), or may elect to defer
the benefit in accordance with any general right to defer commencement of benefits under the Plan.

During a period when Section 17.1(a) applies to the Plan, Participants and beneficiaries are permitted to elect payment in any
optional form of benefit otherwise available under the Plan that provides for the current payment of the unrestricted portion of the
benefit (as described in section 1.436-1(d)(3)(iii)(D) of the Treasury Regulations), with a delayed commencement for the restricted
portion of the benefit (subject to other applicable qualification requirements, such as sections 411(a)(11) and 401(a)(9) of the Code).

(b)        Plan  Amendments  Increasing  Liability  for  Benefits.  No  amendment  to  the  Plan  that  has  the  effect  of  increasing
liabilities  of  the  Plan  by  reason  of  increases  in  benefits,  establishment  of  new  benefits,  changing  the  rate  of  benefit  accrual,  or
changing the rate at which benefits become

50

nonforfeitable shall take effect in a Plan Year if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year is:

(i)        Less than 80%; or

(ii)               80%  or  more,  but  would  be  less  than  80%  if  the  benefits  attributable  to  the  amendment  were  taken  into

account in determining the adjusted funding target attainment percentage.

The limitation set forth in this Section 17.1(b) does not apply to any amendment to the Plan that provides a benefit increase
under a Plan formula that is not based on compensation, provided that the rate of such increase does not exceed the contemporaneous
rate of increase in the average wages of Participants covered by the amendment.

Section  17.2        Limitations  Applicable  If  the  Plan's  Adjusted  Funding  Target  Attainment  Percentage  Is  Less  Than  60%.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, if the Plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a Plan Year is less
than  60%  (or  would  be  less  than  60%  to  the  extent  described  in  Section  17.2(b)  below),  then  the  limitations  in  this  Section  17.2
apply.

(a)    Single Sums, Other Accelerated Forms of Distribution, and Other Prohibited Payments Not Permitted. A Participant or
beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of benefit that includes
a prohibited payment with an annuity starting date on or after the applicable section 436 measurement date, and the Plan shall not
make any payment for the purchase of an irrevocable commitment from an insurer to pay benefits or any other payment or transfer
that is a prohibited payment. The limitation set forth in this Section 17.2(a) does not apply to any payment of a benefit which under
Section 411(a)(11) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant.

(b)        Shutdown  Benefits  and  Other  Unpredictable  Contingent  Event  Benefits  Not  Permitted  to  Be  Paid. An unpredictable
contingent  event  benefit  with  respect  to  an  unpredictable  contingent  event  occurring  during  a  Plan  Year  shall  not  be  paid  if  the
adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year is:

(i)    Less than 60%; or

(ii)        60%  or  more,  but  would  be  less  than  60%  if  the  adjusted  funding  target  attainment  percentage  were
redetermined applying an actuarial assumption that the likelihood of occurrence of the unpredictable contingent event during
the Plan Year is 100%.

(c)    Benefit Accruals Frozen. Benefit accruals under the Plan shall cease as of the applicable section 436 measurement date.
In addition, if the Plan is required to cease benefit accruals under this Section 17.2(c), then the Plan is not permitted to be amended
in a manner that would

51

increase the liabilities of the Plan by reason of an increase in benefits or establishment of new benefits.

Section 17.3        Limitations  Applicable  If  the  Plan  Sponsor  Is  In  Bankruptcy. Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  of  the
Plan, a Participant or beneficiary is not permitted to elect, and the Plan shall not pay, a single sum payment or other optional form of
benefit that includes a prohibited payment with an annuity starting date that occurs during any period in which the Plan sponsor is a
debtor in a case under title 11, United States Code, or similar Federal or State law, except for payments made within a Plan Year
with an annuity starting date that occurs on or after the date on which the Plan's enrolled actuary certifies that the Plan's adjusted
funding  target  attainment  percentage  for  that  Plan  Year  is  not  less  than  100%.  In  addition,  during  such  period  in  which  the  Plan
sponsor  is  a  debtor,  the  Plan  shall  not  make  any  payment  for  the  purchase  of  an  irrevocable  commitment  from  an  insurer  to  pay
benefits or any other payment or transfer that is a prohibited payment, except for payments that occur on a date within a Plan Year
that is on or after the date on which the Plan's enrolled actuary certifies that the Plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage
for that Plan Year is not less than 100%. The limitation  set forth in this Section  17.3 does not apply  to any payment  of a benefit
which under section 411(a)(11) of the Code may be immediately distributed without the consent of the Participant.

Section 17.4    Provisions Applicable After Limitations Cease to Apply.

(a)    Resumption of Prohibited Payments. If a limitation on prohibited payments under Section 17.1(a), Section 17.2(a), or
Section 17.3 applied to the Plan as of a section 436 measurement date, but that limit no longer applies to the Plan as of a later section
436 measurement date, then that limitation does not apply to benefits with annuity starting dates that are on or after that later section
436 measurement date.

In addition, after the section 436 measurement date on which the limitation on prohibited payments under Section 17.1(a) or
17.2(a) ceases to apply to the Plan, any Participant or beneficiary who had an annuity starting date within the period during which
that limitation applied to the Plan is permitted to make a new election (within 90 days after the section 436 measurement date on
which the limit ceases to apply or, if later, 30 days after receiving notice of the right to make such election) under which the form of
benefit previously elected is modified at a new annuity starting date to be changed to a single sum payment for the remaining value
of the Participant or beneficiary's benefit under the Plan, subject to the other rules in this Article XVII and applicable requirements
of section 401(a) the Code, including spousal consent.

(b)       Resumption of Benefit Accruals. If a limitation  on benefit accruals  under Section 17.2(c) applied  to the Plan as of a
section  436  measurement  date,  but  that  limitation  no  longer  applies  to  the  Plan  as  of  a  later  section  436  measurement  date,  then
benefit accruals shall resume prospectively and that limitation does not apply to benefit accruals that are based on service on or

52

after  that  later  section  436  measurement  date,  except  as  otherwise  provided  under  the  Plan.  The  Plan  shall  comply  with  the  rules
relating  to  partial  years  of  participation  and  the  prohibition  on  double  proration  under  Department  of  Labor  regulation  29  CFR
section 2530.204-2(c) and (d).

In addition, benefit accruals that were not permitted to accrue because of the application of Section 17.2(c) shall be restored
when that limitation ceases to apply if the continuous period of the limitation was 12 months or less and the Plan's enrolled actuary
certifies that the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year would not be less than 60% taking into account any
restored benefit accruals for the prior Plan Year.

(c)    Shutdown and Other Unpredictable Contingent Event Benefits. If an unpredictable contingent event benefit with respect
to an unpredictable contingent event that occurs during the Plan Year is not permitted to be paid after the occurrence of the event
because  of  the  limitation  of  Section  17.2(b),  but  is  permitted  to  be  paid  later  in  the  same  Plan  Year  (as  a  result  of  additional
contributions or pursuant to the enrolled actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year
that  meets  the  requirements  of  section  1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(B)  of  the  Treasury  Regulations),  then  that  unpredictable  contingent  event
benefit shall be paid, retroactive to the period that benefit would have been payable under the terms of the Plan (determined without
regard to Section 17.2(b)). If the unpredictable contingent event benefit does not become payable during the Plan Year in accordance
with the preceding sentence, then the Plan is treated as if it does not provide for that benefit.

(d)    Treatment of Plan Amendments That Do Not Take Effect. If a Plan amendment does not take effect as of the effective
date of the amendment because of the limitation of Section 17.1(b) or Section 17.2(c), but is permitted to take effect later in the same
Plan  Year  (as  a  result  of  additional  contributions  or  pursuant  to  the  enrolled  actuary's  certification  of  the  adjusted  funding  target
attainment  percentage  for  the  Plan  Year  that  meets  the  requirements  of  section  1.436-1(g)(5)(ii)(C)  of  the  Treasury  Regulations),
then the Plan amendment must automatically take effect as of the first day of the Plan Year (or, if later, the original effective date of
the  amendment).  If  the  Plan  amendment  cannot  take  effect  during  the  same  Plan  Year,  then  it  shall  be  treated  as  if  it  were  never
adopted, unless the Plan amendment provides otherwise.

Section  17.5        Notice  Requirement.  See  section  101(j)  of  ERISA  for  rules  requiring  the  plan  administrator  of  a  single
employer  defined  benefit  pension  plan  to  provide  a  written  notice  to  participants  and  beneficiaries  within  30  days  after  certain
specified dates if the plan has become subject to a limitation described in Section 17.1(a), Section 17.2, or Section 17.3.

Section 17.6    Methods to Avoid or Terminate Benefit Limitations. See section 436(b)(2), (c)(2), (e)(2), and (f) of the Code

terminate- the -application of -the- -limitations -set -forth in- - Sections 17.1 through 17.3 for a Plan Year. In general, the methods a

53

plan sponsor may use to avoid or terminate one or more of the benefit limitations under Sections 17.1 through 17.3 for a Plan Year
include employer contributions and elections to increase the amount of plan assets which are taken into account in determining the
adjusted  funding  target  attainment  percentage,  making  an  employer  contribution  that  is  specifically  designated  as  a  current  year
contribution that is made to avoid or terminate application of certain of the benefit limitations, or providing security to the plan.

Section 17.7    Special Rules.

(a)        Rules  of  Operation  for  Periods  Prior  to  and  After  Certification  of  Plan's  Adjusted  Funding  Target  Attainment

Percentage.

(i)    In General. Section 436(h) of the Code and section 1.436-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations set forth a series of
presumptions  that  apply  (1)  before  the  Plan's  enrolled  actuary  issues  a  certification  of  the  Plan's  adjusted  funding  target
attainment  percentage  for  the  Plan  Year  and  (2)  if  the  Plan's  enrolled  actuary  does  not  issue  a  certification  of  the  Plan's
adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year before the first day of the tenth month of the Plan Year (or if
the Plan's enrolled actuary issues a range certification for the Plan Year pursuant to section 1.436-1(h)(4)(ii) of the Treasury
Regulations but does not issue a certification of the specific adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan by the
last  day  of  the  Plan  Year).  For  any  period  during  which  a  presumption  under  section  436(h)  of  the  Code  and  section
1.436¬1(h) of the Treasury Regulations applies to the Plan, the limitations under Sections 17.1 through 17.3 are applied to
the Plan as if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year were the presumed adjusted funding target
attainment percentage determined under the rules of section 436(h) of the Code and section 1.436-1(h)(1), (2), or (3) of the
Treasury Regulations. These presumptions are set forth in Section 17.7(a)(ii) though (iv).

(ii)    Presumption of Continued Underfunding Beginning First Day of Plan Year. If a limitation under Section 17.1,
17.2, or 17.3 applied to the Plan on the last day of the preceding Plan Year, then, commencing on the first day of the current
Plan  Year  and  continuing  until  the  Plan's  enrolled  actuary  issues  a  certification  of  the  adjusted  funding  target  attainment
percentage for the Plan for the current Plan Year, or, if earlier, the date Section 17.7(a)(iii) or Section 17.7(a)(iv) applies to
the Plan:

(A)    The adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the Plan for the current Plan Year is presumed to

be the adjusted funding target attainment percentage in effect on the last day of the preceding Plan Year; and

(B)    The first day of the current Plan Year is a section 436 measurement date.

54

(iii)        Presumption  of  Underfunding  Beginning  First  Day  of  Fourth  Month.  If  the  Plan's  enrolled  actuary  has  not
issued a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year before the first day of the fourth
month of the Plan Year and the Plan's adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the preceding Plan Year was either at
least 60% but less than 70% or at least 80% but less than 90%, or is described in section 1.436-1(h)(2)(ii) of the Treasury
Regulations, then, commencing on the first day of the fourth month of the current Plan Year and continuing until the Plan's
enrolled actuary issues a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan for the current Plan
Year, or, if earlier, the date Section 17.7(a)(iv) applies to the Plan:

(A)    The adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the Plan for the current Plan Year is presumed to
be  the  Plan's  adjusted  funding  target  attainment  percentage  for  the  preceding  Plan  Year  reduced  by  10  percentage
points; and

(B)    The first day of the fourth month of the current Plan Year is a section 436 measurement date.

(iv)    Presumption of Underfunding On and After First Day of Tenth Month. If the Plan's enrolled actuary has not
issued a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the Plan Year before the first day of the tenth
month of the Plan Year (or if the Plan's enrolled actuary has issued a range certification for the Plan Year pursuant to section
1.436-1(h)(4)(ii)  of  the  Treasury  Regulations  but  has  not  issued  a  certification  of  the  specific  adjusted  funding  target
attainment percentage for the Plan by the last day of the Plan Year), then, commencing on the first day of the tenth month of
the current Plan Year and continuing through the end of the Plan Year:

(A)    The adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the Plan for the current Plan Year is presumed to

be less than 60%; and

(B)    The first day of the tenth month of the current Plan Year is a section 436 measurement date.

(b)    New Plans, Plan Termination, Certain Frozen Plans, and Other Special Rules.

(i)    First 5 Plan Years. The limitations in Section 17.1(b), Section 17.2(b), and Section 17.2(c) do not apply to a new
plan for the first 5 plan years of the plan, determined under the rules of section 436(i) of the Code and section 1.436-1(a)(3)
(i) of the Treasury Regulations.

(ii)    Plan Termination. The limitations on prohibited payments in Section 17.1(a), Section 17.2(a), and Section 17.3

do not apply to prohibited payments that are made to carry

55

out the termination of the Plan in accordance with applicable law. Any other limitations under this Section of the Plan do not
cease to apply as a result of termination of the Plan.

(iii)       Exception  to Limitations  on Prohibited  Payments  Under Certain  Frozen  Plans. The limitations  on prohibited
payments set forth in Sections 17.1(a), 17.2(a), and 17.3 do not apply for a Plan Year if the terms of the Plan, as in effect for
the period beginning on September 1, 2005, and continuing through the end of the Plan Year, provide for no benefit accruals
with  respect  to  any  Participants.  This  Section  17.7(b)(iii)  shall  cease  to  apply  as  of  the  date  any  benefits  accrue  under  the
Plan or the date on which a Plan amendment that increases benefits takes effect.

(iv)    Special Rules Relating to Unpredictable Contingent Event Benefits and Plan Amendments Increasing Benefit
Liability.  During  any  period  in  which  none  of  the  presumptions  under  Section  17.7(a)  apply  to  the  Plan  and  the  Plan's
enrolled  actuary  has  not  yet  issued  a  certification  of  the  Plan's  adjusted  funding  target  attainment  percentage  for  the  Plan
year,  the  limitations  under  Section  17.1(b)  and  Section  17.2(b)  shall  be  based  on  the  inclusive  presumed  adjusted  funding
target attainment percentage for the Plan, calculated in accordance with the rules of section 1.436-1(g)(2)(iii) of the Treasury
Regulations.

(c)    Special Rules Under PRA 2010.

(i)    Payments Under Social Security Leveling Options. For purposes of determining whether the limitations under
Section 17.1(a) or 17.2(a) apply to payments under a social security leveling option, within the meaning of section 436(j)(3)
(C)(i) of the Code, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a Plan Year shall be determined in accordance with
the "Special Rule for Certain Years" under section 436(j)(3) of the Code and any Treasury Regulations or other published
guidance thereunder issued by the Internal Revenue Service.

(ii)        Limitation  on  Benefit  Accruals.  For  purposes  of  determining  whether  the  accrual  limitation  under  Section
17.2(c)  applies  to  the  Plan  the  adjusted  funding  target  attainment  percentage  for  a  Plan  Year  shall  be  determined  in
accordance with the "Special Rule for Certain Years" under section 436(j)(3) of the Code (except as provided under section
203(b) of the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, if applicable).

(d)    Interpretation of Provisions. The limitations imposed by this Section of the Plan shall be interpreted and administered in

accordance with section 436 of the Code and section 1.436-1 of the Treasury Regulations.

TOP-HEAVY PROVISIONS AND BENEFIT LIMITS

A.    Top-Heavy Plan Definitions.

The following words and phrases as used herein have the following meanings unless a different meaning is plainly required

by the context:

A.1    “Account Balance” means the sum of:

A.1.1    the present value, as of the Top-Heavy Valuation Date, of a Participant’s  Accrued Benefit under the Plan,

determined in the same manner as Actuarial Equivalent forms of benefit are determined under the Plan;

A.1.2    the balance, as of the Top-Heavy Valuation Date, standing to the credit of a Participant (including a surviving
spouse or Contingent Annuitant of such Participant) in any Defined Contribution Plan maintained by the Employer, including
contributions that would be allocated as of the Top-Heavy Valuation Date, even though these amounts are not yet required to
be contributed, and any contribution attributable (A) to a plan-to-plan transfer or rollover contribution from another qualified
employee pension benefit plan or a rollover individual retirement account, accepted before January 1, 1984, or (B) a related
plan-to-plan transfer or rollover individual retirement account; and

A.1.3    the aggregate distributions made with respect to such Participant (including a surviving spouse or Contingent
Annuitant of such Participant) under the Plan during the five year period ending on the Determination Date. If a distribution
is  made  in  the  form  of  an  annuity  contract,  the  amount  of  such  distribution  shall  be  equal  to  the  actuarial  value  of  the
contract, determined on the date of the distribution. Benefits paid on account of death shall only be included to the extent of
the present value of the decedent’s Accrued Benefit immediately prior to death.

The term “Account Balance” shall not include any amount held or distributed on behalf of any Participant who is a Former
Key  Employee,  or  who  has  performed  no  service  for  the  Employer  (other  than  benefits  under  qualified  plans  maintained  by  the

location  of  the  employment  or  the  services  performed)  and  actually  paid  to  the  Participant  during  the  Limitation  Year.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  for  Limitation  Years  beginning  on  and  after  July  1,  2007,  Compensation  includes  regular  pay  as
described in Treas. Reg. § 1.415(c)-(2)(e)(3) if paid by the end of the Limitation Year that includes the Employee’s termination of

sentence shall not be considered Compensation if paid after separation from service, even if they are paid by the later of 2½ months
after  the  date  of  separation  from  service  or  the  end  of  the  Limitation  Year  that  includes  the  date  of  severance  from  employment.
Effective  for distributions  made on and after January 1, 2009, Compensation  shall include  the amount of any military  differential

section 401(a) of the Code and provides for an individual account for each Participant and for benefits based solely on the amount
contributed  to  the  Participant’s  account,  and  any  income,  expenses,  gains  and  losses,  and  any  forfeitures  of  accounts  of  other
Participants that may be allocated to such Participant’s account.

A.6.1    if the Plan is not included in an Aggregation Group, the last day of the preceding Plan Year; or

A.6.2    if the Plan is included in an Aggregation Group, the Determination Date as determined under Section A.6.1

that falls within the same calendar year of each other plan included in such Aggregation Group.

A.7    “Employee” means the Employer as defined in Section 2.1(q) of the Plan.

A.8    “Former Key Employee” means an Employee or former Employee who is a Non-Key Employee with respect to the

Plan for the Plan Year if such individual was a Key Employee with respect to the Plan for any prior Plan Year.

APP-2-2

A.9         “Key  Employee”  means  any  Employee  or  former  Employee  (including  any  deceased  Employee)  who  at  any  time

living, a five-percent owner of the Employer, or a one-percent owner of the Employer having annual Compensation of more than

regulations and other guidance of general applicability issued thereunder.

such Participant) who is not a Key Employee with respect to the Plan for the Plan Year.

A.11    “Permissive Aggregation Group” means:

A.11.1    each plan of the Employer included in a Required Aggregation Group; and

A.11.2        each  other  plan  of  the  Employer  if  the  group  of  plans  consisting  of  such  plan  or  plans  included  in  the
Required Aggregation Group, when considered as a single plan, meets the requirements of section 401(a)(4) and section 410
of the Code.

A.12.1    each plan of the Employer in which a Key Employee participated (regardless of whether such plan has been

terminated) during the Plan Year ending on the Determination Date; and

A.12.2        each  other  plan  of  the  Employer  which  enables  any  plan  described  in  Section  A.12.1  to  meet  the

ending on the Determination Date.

A.13.1    the aggregate of the Account Balances of Key Employees under all Defined Contribution Plans included in

such Aggregation Group, and

A.13.2        the  aggregate  of  the  present  value  of  cumulative  accrued  benefits  for  Key  Employees  under  all  Defined

Benefit Plans included in such Aggregation Group,

APP-2-3

exceeds 60% of the sum of such aggregates determined for all Employees included in the Aggregation Group.

A.14    “Top-Heavy Plan” means the Plan, if as of the Determination Date:

A.14.1        the  aggregate  of  the  Account  Balances  of  Key  Employees  exceeds  60%  of  the  aggregate  of  the  Account

Balances of all Employees; or

A.14.2    the Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group which is a Top-Heavy Group.

Notwithstanding Section A.14.1 and Section A.14.2, the Plan shall not be considered a Top-Heavy Plan for any Plan Year in

which the Plan is a part of a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation Group which is not a Top-Heavy Group.

A.15    “Top-Heavy Valuation Date” means the Determination Date.

B.    Top-Heavy Plan Provisions.

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan within the meaning of Section A.14 and
section  416(g)  of  the  Code  for  any  Plan  Year  beginning  after  December  31,  1983,  then  the  Plan  shall  meet  the  requirements  of
Section B.1, Section B.2 and Section B.3 for each such Plan Year.

B.1    Minimum Vesting Requirement. The vested interest of a Participant who is credited with an Hour of Service after the
Plan  becomes  a  Top-Heavy  Plan  will  be  determined  under  a  schedule  which  is  not  less  favorable  to  the  Participant  than  the
following:

Years of Service
As Defined in

APP-2-4

B.2.1.    This Plan shall provide a minimum annual retirement benefit for each such Plan Year for each Participant
who  is  a  Non-Key  Employee  in  an  amount  equal  to  2%  of  such  Participant’s  average  Compensation  for  the  period  of
consecutive  years  (not  exceeding  five)  during  which  the  Participant  had  the  greatest  aggregate  Compensation  from  the
Employer, multiplied by the Participant’s Years of Service, not to exceed 10.

B.2.2    The minimum benefit or contribution shall be made for each Non-Key Employee who is employed at the end
of the Plan Year in question, regardless of whether such Non-Key Employee has been credited with 1,000 Hours of Service
in such Plan Year and regardless of such Non-Key Employee’s level of Compensation.

B.3    Change in Top-Heavy Status. If the Plan becomes a Top-Heavy Plan and subsequently ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan,
the  vesting  schedule  in  Section  B.1  shall  continue  to  apply  in  determining  the  vested  percentage  of  the  Accrued  Benefit  of  any
Participant who had at least five Years of Service as of the last day of the last Plan Year in which the Plan was a Top-Heavy Plan.
For all other Participants, the vesting schedule in Section B.1 shall apply only to their Accrued Benefit as of such last day.

B.4        Determination  of  Present  Values  and  Amounts.  Effective  for  Plan  Years  beginning  after  December  31,  2001,  this
Paragraph shall apply for purposes of determining the present values of Accrued Benefits and the amounts of Account Balances of
Employees as of the Determination Date.

B.4.1        The  present  values  of  Accrued  Benefits  and  the  amounts  of  Account  Balances  of  an  Employee  as  of  the
Determination Date shall be increased by the distributions made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any plan
aggregated with the Plan under section 416(g)(2) of the Code during the one-year period ending on the Determination Date.
The  preceding  sentence  shall  also  apply  to distributions  under  a terminated  plan which,  had  it not been  terminated,  would
have been aggregated with the Plan under section 416(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Code. In the case of a distribution made for a reason
other than severance from employment, death, or disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting “five-year period”
for “one-year period.”

B.4.2        The  Accrued  Benefits  and  Account  Balances  of  any  individual  who  has  not  performed  services  for  the

Employer during the one-year period ending on the Determination Date shall not be taken into account.

B.5        Minimum  Benefits.  Effective  for  Plan  Years  beginning  after  December  31,  2001,  for  purposes  of  satisfying  the
minimum benefit requirements of section 416(c)(1) of the Code and the Plan, in determining Years of Service with the Employer,
any service with the Employer shall be

APP-2-5

disregarded to the extent that such service occurs during a Plan Year when the Plan benefits (within the meaning of section 410(b) of
the Code) no Key Employee or former Key Employee.

C.    Limitations on Benefits - Code Section 415 Limit.

C.1    Effective for Limitation Years ending after December 31, 2001, in no case shall the annual benefit with respect to any
Participant payable under the Plan and all other Defined Benefit Plans, when expressed in the form of an annual single life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits), exceed the “maximum permissible benefit” which shall be the lesser of the amount determined under
Paragraph C.1.1 or C.1.2 (both adjusted where required, as provided in Paragraph C.1.3, and, if applicable,  in Paragraph C.1.4 or
Paragraph C.1.5):

C.1.1        the  dollar  limitation  specified  in  section  415(b)(1)(A)  of  the  Code,  as  in  effect  for  the  Limitation  Year
($215,000 for 2017), as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year under section 415(d) of the Code in such manner as the
Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe (the “Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation”)); or

C.1.2    the greater of $10,000 or 100% of the Participant’s average annual Compensation received during the three
consecutive years of Continuous Service (years of participation in the Plan for Limitation Years beginning before January 1,
2006)  with  the  Employer  and  all  50%  related  employers  during  which  he  receives  the  greatest  aggregate  annual
Compensation.  The  $10,000  restriction  shall  not  apply  if  the  Participant  participates  in  any  defined  contribution  plan
maintained by the Employer, a 50% related employer or a predecessor employer. For purposes of determining the $10,000
amount,  the benefit  payable  to  the  Participant  under  the  Plan  for  a Limitation  Year  reflects  all amounts  payable  under  the
Plan  for  the  Limitation  Year  (except  as  otherwise  provided  in  Treas.  Reg.  §  1.415(d)-1)  and  are  not  adjusted  for  faun  of
benefit or commencement date.

C.1.3    If the Participant has fewer than 10 years of participation in the Plan, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation
shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the
Plan and (ii) the denominator of which is 10. In the case of a Participant who has fewer than 10 Years of Service with the
Employer, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of
years (or part thereof) of service with the Employer and (ii) the denominator of which is 10.

C.1.4    If the benefit of a Participant begins prior to age 62, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable to the
Participant at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age
that  is  the  Actuarial  Equivalent  of  the  Defined  Benefit  Dollar  Limitation  applicable  to  the  Participant  at  age  62  (adjusted
under Paragraph C.1.3 above, if required). The Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable

APP-2-6

at an age prior to age 62 is determined as the lesser of (i) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit Dollar
Limitation computed using the interest rate provided under Section 2.1(b), or (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the
Defined  Benefit  Dollar  Limitation  computed  using  a  5  percent  interest  rate.  Any  decrease  in  the  Defined  Benefit  Dollar
Limitation  determined  in  accordance  with  this  Paragraph  C.1.4  shall  not  reflect  a  mortality  decrement  if  benefits  are  not
forfeited upon the death of the Participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into
account.

Effective for Limitation Years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age
prior to age 62 is determined as the lesser of (1) the actuarial equivalent at such age of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed
using  a  5%  interest  rate  and  the  applicable  mortality  table  under  section  417(e)(3)  of  the  Code,  or  (2)  the  amount  determined  by
multiplying the defined benefit dollar limitation by the ratio of the annual amount of the single life annuity beginning at such earlier
age (computed using the interest rate and mortality table as applicable under Section 2.1(b)) to the annual amount of the single life
annuity under the Plan commencing at age 62 (with both such amounts determined without application of the rules of section 415 of
the Code).

C.1.5        If  the  benefit  of  a  Participant  begins  after  the  Participant  attains  age  65,  the  Defined  Benefit  Dollar  Limitation
applicable to the Participant at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later
age that is Actuarially  Equivalent  to the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation  applicable  to the Participant  at age 65 (adjusted under
Paragraph C.1.3 above, if required). The Actuarial Equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation applicable at an age after age
65 is determined as the lesser of (i) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation computed using
the interest rate provided under Section 2.1(b), or (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation
computed using a 5 percent interest rate. For these purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence shall
be ignored.

Effective  for  Limitation  Years  beginning  on  and  after  July  1,  2007,  for  benefits  commencing  after  age  65,  the  dollar
limitation  shall  be  determined  as  the  lesser  of  (1)  the  actuarial  equivalent  at  such  age  of  the  defined  benefit  dollar  limitation
computed using an interest rate of 5% and the applicable mortality table described under section 417(e)(3) of the Code, or (2) the
amount  determined  by  multiplying  the  defined  benefit  dollar  limitation  by  the  ratio  of  (A)  the  annual  amount  of  the  single  life
annuity beginning at such later age (computed using the interest rate and mortality assumptions for delayed retirement benefits under
the Plan, if applicable) to (B) the annual amount of the single life annuity under the Plan commencing at age 65 (computed without
using  the  interest  rate  and  mortality  assumptions  for  delayed  retirement  benefits  under  the  Plan,  if  applicable)  (with  both  such
amounts in (A) and (B) determined without application of the rules of section 415 of the Code). The amount of the annual benefit
commencing at such later age is the annual amount of the

APP-2-7

benefit (determined without regard to section 415 of the Code) computed by disregarding the Participant’s accruals after age 65, but
including actuarial adjustments even if such adjustments are applied to offset benefit accrual.

C.1.6    Benefit increases resulting from the increase in the limitations of section 415(b) of the Code shall be provided to all
Participants  with  benefits  limited  by  section  415(b)  of  the  Code  who,  (i)  as  of  January  1,  2002  have  commenced  receipt  of  their
benefit under the Plan; or (ii) are credited with at least one Hour of Service on or after January 1, 2002.

C.1.7    If a Participant’s benefit is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity, the determination as to whether the
limitation of this Paragraph C.1 has been satisfied shall be made by adjusting such benefit to the form of a straight life annuity using
an  interest  rate  equal  to  the  greater  of  5%  or  the  interest  rate  provided  under  Section  2.1(b).  However,  for  purposes  of  such
adjustment, any ancillary benefit that is not directly related to retirement income benefits and that portion of any joint and survivor
annuity that constitutes a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity shall not be taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
purposes of adjusting any form of benefit subject to the requirements of section 417(e)(3) of the Code, the interest rate used shall not
be less than the greater of (i) the applicable interest rate under section 417(e)(3) of the Code for the October immediately preceding
the calendar year during which the Annuity Starting Date occurs, provided that the lump sum present value for distributions made on
or  before  October  1,  2007,  shall  not  be  less  than  the  lump  sum  present  value  based  on  the  applicable  interest  rate  under  section
417(e)(3) of the Code for the third calendar month preceding the calendar month in which the Annuity Starting Date occurs, or (ii)
the interest rate specified in Section 2.1(b).

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of adjusting any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3) of
the Code for Plan Years beginning in 2004 or 2005, the interest rate used shall not be less than the greater of (i) 5.5%, or (ii) the
interest rate specified in Section 2.1(b).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for Limitation Years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, for purposes of applying
the limitations under this Article C, if a Participant’s benefits are payable in a form of benefit other than a single life annuity or a
qualified joint and survivor annuity, the benefit shall be limited as follows. The benefit shall be converted to a single life annuity
using the interest rate and mortality assumptions specified in the Plan for the Actuarial Equivalent of the particular form of benefit
payable. The single life annuity, which has been so determined, shall be compared to the single life annuity computed using a 5%
interest rate assumption (or for any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Code, the applicable interest rate as defined in
section 417(e)(3) of the Code) and the IRS mortality table prescribed in section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) of the Code). The greater of these
two amounts shall be the applicable limit for the benefit payable in a form other than a single life annuity or a qualified joint and
survivor annuity.

APP-2-8

Effective as of January 1, 2006, if a Participant’s benefit is payable in a form subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Code, such
benefit shall be adjusted, for purposes of applying the limitations under this Article C, so that it is the greater of (1) a straight life
annuity  determined  using  the  interest  rate  and  mortality  table  as  applicable  under  Section  2.1(b),  (2)  a  straight  life  annuity
determined using an interest rate of 5.5% and the applicable mortality table described under section 417(e)(3) of the Code, or (3) a
straight life annuity determined using the interest rate that produces a benefit of not more than 105% of the benefit that would be
produced using the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table described under section 417(e)(3) of the Code.

C.2        Applicable  Mortality  Table  for  Distributions  With  Annuity  Starting  Dates  on  or  after  December  31,  2002.
Notwithstanding any other Plan provisions to the contrary, the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit
or limitation under section 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of the Code as set forth in this Article C (unless another mortality table is either
required under section 415(b) of the Code or otherwise referenced in this Article C) is the table prescribed in Rev. Rul. 2007-67 for
Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2007 (Rev. Rul. 2001-62 for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2008), or such other
table as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.

C.3    Definition of Compensation. For purposes of this Article C, Compensation shall include all amounts that are treated as
wages for Federal income tax withholding under section 3401(a) of the Code (determined without regard to any rules that limit the
remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed) and actually paid to
the Participant during the Limitation Year, plus amounts that would be paid to the Employee during the year but for the Employee’s
election under a cash or deferred arrangement described in section 401(k) of the Code, a cafeteria plan described in section 125 of
the Code, a qualified transportation fringe benefit program described in section 132(f)(4) of the Code, a simplified employee pension
described in section 402(h) of the Code or an annuity program described in section 403(b) of the Code.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Limitation Years beginning on and after July 1, 2007, Compensation includes regular pay
as described in Treas. Reg. § 1.415(c)-(2)(e)(3) if paid by the end of the Limitation Year that includes the Employee’s termination of
employment, or if later, 2½ months after the Employee’s termination of employment Any payments not described in the foregoing
sentence shall not be considered Compensation if paid after separation from service, even if they are paid by the later of 2½ months
after the date of separation from service or the end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of severance from employment.

C.4    Application of the provisions of this Section C of this Appendix 2 in effect for Limitation Years beginning on and after
July 1, 2007, shall not cause the maximum permissible benefit for any Participant to be less than the Participant’s accrued benefit
under all the defined

APP-2-9

benefit  plans  of  the  Employer  or  a  predecessor  employer  as  of  the  end  of  the  last  Limitation  Year  beginning  before  July  1,  2007
under  provisions  of  the  plans  that  were  both  adopted  and  in  effect  before  April  5,  2007  determined  in  accordance  with  the
requirements of section 415 of the Code in effect on that date.

C.5    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan hereby incorporates by reference section 415 of the Code and the regulations

employed on or after July 1, 2012, his benefit shall be a monthly amount equal to the sum of:

(a)    1.33% times Years of Service prior to July 1, 2012 times Final Average Earnings; plus

(b)    1.60% times Years of Service on or after July 1, 2012 times Final Average Earnings; plus

regardless of whether he is still employed by the Employer on such date.

E.    Late Retirement Income. The benefit payable to a Local 51 Participant commencing on his Late Retirement Date shall

be the greatest of:

The above factors shall be prorated for a partial year (counting a partial month as a complete month). Factors for numbers of
years beyond 10 shall be determined using a consistently applied reasonable actuarially equivalent method; or

(iii)    with respect to a Local 51 Participant whose Late Retirement Date occurs after his Required Beginning Date,
his  normal  retirement  benefit  as  determined  under  Section  D  (determined  as  of  June  30,  2012)  multiplied  by  the  factor  in
Section E(ii) for I year past Normal Retirement Date, prorated for a partial year based on the number of months in the period
(counting a partial month as a complete month).

The  amount  in  this  Section  E(iii)  shall  be  redetermined  after  each  subsequent  April  1  based  on  the  retirement  benefit  that
would  have  been  paid  on  his  Required  Beginning  Date  (determined  as  if  his  Late  Retirement  Date  had  occurred  on  his
Required Beginning Date) multiplied by the factor in Section E(ii) for 1 year past Normal Retirement Date, prorated for a
partial year based on the number of months since such Yearly Date (counting a partial month as a complete month).

Such greatest amount so determined applies to an active Local 51 Participant, who (1) is not a five-percent owner, (2) has
attained age 70%2, and (3) makes an election to defer commencement of his retirement benefit until the calendar year following the
calendar year in which he retires.

F.    Minimum Benefit. An active Local 51 Participant's benefit payable as a Single Life Annuity shall not be less than the
greatest  amount  of  benefit  that  would  have  been  provided  for  him  had  he  retired  on  any  earlier  retirement  date.  In  any  event,  an
active  Local  51  Participant's  retirement  benefit  payable  as  a  Single  Life  Annuity  on  his  retirement  date  will  not  be  less  than  the
greater  of  his  Required  Contribution  Account  Accrued  Benefit  on  his  retirement  date,  multiplied  by  the  appropriate  factor  if  his
retirement  date  is  an  Early  Retirement  Date,  or  the  monthly  benefit  payable  as  a  Single  Life  Annuity  which  is  the  Actuarial
Equivalent of his Required Contribution Account on such date.

G.    Vesting. A Local 51 Participant shall have no vested interest in his Accrued Benefit until he has been credited with five
Years of Service for vesting purposes, at which time he shall have a 100% vested interest in his Accrued Benefit determined under
this Article IX. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Local 51 Participant who is actively employed by the Employer shall have a 100%
vested interest in his Accrued Benefit upon reaching his Early Retirement Age or Normal Retirement Age.

A Local 51 Participant's Required Contribution Account is fully 100% vested and nonforfeitable at all times.

APP-4-21

H.    Vested Benefits in the Event of Termination of Employment. The benefit of any vested active Local 51 Participant who

terminates employment on or after July 1, 2004 shall be:

(i)    in the case of a Local 51 Participant who elects to commence his deferred vested benefit on his Early Retirement
Date, an amount determined in accordance with Section H(ii) below multiplied by the applicable early retirement factor in
Section C above.

(ii)        in  the  case  of  a  Local  51  Participant  who  elects  to  commence  his  deferred  vested  benefit  on  his  Normal

Retirement Date, an amount equal to the sum of (a) and (b):

(a)    the Local 51 Participant's Required Contribution Accrued Benefit as of the date of determination (or the date the

Required Contribution Account is paid in a single sum, if earlier);

(b)    the excess of the Local 51 Participant's Accrued Benefit on the day before he terminated employment over the

amount determined under (a) above but not less than $0.

(iii)    in the case of a Local 51 Participant who elects to commence his deferred vested benefit on his Late Retirement

Date, an amount equal to:

(a)    if he terminated on or before his Normal Retirement Date, an amount equal to the amount under Section H(ii)
above multiplied by the late retirement factor in Section E(ii) which corresponds to the number of years his Late Retirement
Date follows his Normal Retirement Date; or

(b)    if he terminated after his Normal Retirement Date, an amount equal to the greater of:

(1)    his Accrued Benefit on the day before he terminated employment with the Employer; or

(2)    his Accrued Benefit on his Normal Retirement Date multiplied by the late retirement factor in Section

E(ii) which corresponds to the number of years his Late Retirement Date follows his Normal Retirement Date.

Provided, however, for a terminated Local 51 Participant whose Late Retirement Date occurs after his Required Beginning
Date,  his  deferred  monthly  retirement  benefit  determined  in  Section  H(iii)(a)  or  (b)  of  this  Article  IX,  whichever  applies,
shall be adjusted as provided in Section E(iii) of this Article IX.

I.    Forms of Distribution.

APP-4-22

(i)    Normal Form for Unmarried Local 51 Participants. The normal form of distribution for an unmarried Local 51

of Section 6.2 of the Plan, as applicable, to receive his Required Contribution Account in a single-sum payment at any time
after he ceases to be an Employee and before his retirement date, provided he is not reemployed by the Employer.

(iv)    Survivor Benefits Available by Election. A Local 51 Participant who is actively employed on or after July 1,
2012 may elect, subject to the notice and election provisions of Section 62 of the Plan, as applicable, to provide benefits for
his Contingent Annuitant as described in Section 6.4.

J.    Preretirement Survivor Annuity.

(i)        Eligibility  for  Preretirement  Survivor  Annuity. If  a  married  Local  51  Participant  or  an  unmarried  Local  51
Participant who has designated a Contingent Annuitant dies on or after July 1, 2012 but before his Annuity Starting Date, his
surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant, as applicable, shall receive a Preretirement Survivor Annuity as provided in this
Section  J.  If  a  Local  51  Participant  dies  prior  to  July  1,  2012,  the  benefit,  if  any,  payable  to  his  spouse  or  Contingent
Annuitant shall be determined under the provisions of the Plan in effect prior to July 1, 2012.

(ii)    Death Prior to Early Retirement Eligibility, After Completing Five, But Not Yet Ten Years of Service. In the
event of the death of a married Local 51 Participant or an unmarried Local 51 Participant who has designated a Contingent
Annuitant on or after the date he had competed at least five Years of Service but before he had completed at least ten Years
of Service or become eligible for Early Retirement, whether such Local 51 Participant is then actively employed or not, such
Local 51 Participant's spouse or Contingent Annuitant, as applicable, shall be entitled to a benefit, payable, if such spouse or
Contingent Annuitant is then surviving, on the first day of the month coincident with, or next following the later of (A) the
date of the Local 51 Participant's death or (B) the date the Local 51 Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived.
The  amount  of  such  benefit  shall  be  the  same  amount  that  such  surviving  spouse  or  Contingent  Annuitant  would  have
received had such Local 51 Participant terminated his service, survived to age 55, elected the 50% contingent

APP-4-23

annuity form of benefit, as determined under Table 2 based on his and his spouse's or Contingent Annuitant's then attained
ages, and then died.

(iii)        Death  Prior  to  Early  Retirement  Eligibility  but  After  Completing  Ten  Years  of  Service. In  the  event  of  the
death of a married Local 51 Participant or an unmarried Local 51 Participant who has designated a Contingent Annuitant on
or after the date he has completed at least ten Years of Service but prior to becoming eligible for Early Retirement, whether
such Local 51 Participant is then actively employed or not, such Local 51 Participant's spouse or Contingent Annuitant, as
applicable, shall be entitled to a benefit, payable, if such spouse or Contingent Annuitant is then surviving, on the first day of
the month coincident with, or next following the later of (A) the date of the Local 51 Participant's death or (B) the date the
Local 51 Participant would have attained age 55 had he survived. The amount of such benefit shall be the same amount that
such surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant would have received had such Local 51 Participant retired on the day before
his death, or at age 55 if the date of death is prior to the date the Local 51 Participant attains age 55, elected to receive the
100% contingent annuity form of benefit and then died. The amount of such benefit shall be determined under Table 4, based
on his attained age and the attained age of his spouse or Contingent Annuitant, except that for purposes of applying Table 4,
the Local 51 Participant's attained age, if less than age 55, shall be considered to be age 55 and his spouse's or Contingent
Annuitant's  age shall be adjusted  so that it bears the same relationship  to age 55 as their  actual  attained  ages bear  to each
other.

(iv)    Death After Becoming Eligible for Early Retirement. In the event of the death of a married Local 51 Participant
or an unmarried Local 51 Participant who has designated a Contingent Annuitant while he is eligible for Early Retirement,
whether  such  Local  51  Participant  is  then  actively  employed  or  not,  such  Local  51  Participant's  spouse  or  Contingent
Annuitant, as applicable, shall be entitled to a benefit, payable, if such spouse or Contingent Annuitant is then surviving, on
the first day of the month coincident with, or next following the date of the Local 51 Participant's death. The amount of such
benefit shall be the same amount that such surviving spouse or Contingent Annuitant would have received had such Local 51
Participant  retired  on  the  day  before  his  death,  elected  to  receive  the  100%  contingent  annuitant  form  of  benefit  as
determined  under Table 4, based on his attained  age and the attained  age of his spouse or Contingent  Annuitant,  and then
died.

would  have  received  had  such  Local  51  Participant  retired  on  his  Late  Retirement  Date,  elected  to  receive  the  100%
contingent annuitant form of benefit as determined under Table 4, based on his attained age and the attained age of his spouse
or Contingent. Annuitant, and then died.

(vi)    Any benefit payable under this Section J shall terminate on the surviving spouse's or Contingent Annuitant's

death.

(vii)    Notwithstanding anything in this Section J to the contrary, if a single-sum death benefit would otherwise be
payable under Section K below, the monthly benefit payable to the spouse or Contingent Annuitant, as applicable, under this
Section J shall not be less than the monthly benefit which is the Actuarial Equivalent of the single-sum death benefit at the
date benefits start.

K.    Single-Sum Death Benefit. If the requirements of Section J above have not been met on the date a Local 51 Participant
dies, a single-sum death benefit equal to his Required Contribution Account on the date he died, if any, shall be payable to the Local
51 Participant's spouse, if any, or to the Local 51 Participant's estate. If the requirements of Section J above have been met on the
date  such  Local  51  Participant  dies,  but  the  Local  51  Participant's  spouse  or  Contingent  Annuitant  dies  before  the  preretirement
survivor annuity starts, this single-sum death benefit, determined as of the date of the spouse's or Contingent Annuitant's death, shall
be paid to the Local 51 Participant's estate.

L.    Disability Retirement Income.

(i)        A  Local  51  Participant  who  has  completed  10  or  more  Years  of  Service,  and  who  qualifies  for  disability
retirement  under  this  Section  L  shall  be  retired  as  of  the  first  day  of  the  month  following  the  first  month  in  which  the
Committee  has  received  both  (i)  the  Local  51  Participant's  written  request  for  disability  retirement,  and  (ii)  evidence
reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  Committee  that  the  Local  51  Participant  has  been  determined  by  the  United  States  Social
Security  Administration  to  qualify  for  total  and  permanent  disability  benefits  under  the  Social  Security  Act.  A  Local  51
Participant shall be eligible for disability retirement benefits if, as a result of mental or physical illness or injury (other than
self-inflicted) while actively employed, he qualifies for disability benefits under the Social Security Act. Disability benefit
payments shall commence in either the month in which the disabled Local 51 Participant is retired, as described above, or in
the next following month, as may be administratively practicable. Such payments under the Plan shall be made retroactively
to the first day of the month following the date as of which the Local 51 Participant is deemed to be disabled by the Social
Security Administration, or, if later, to

APP-4-25

the last day of the Local 51 Participant's eligibility for continuation of the Local 51 Participant's salary or hourly wages as
sick  pay  under  an  applicable  Employer  sick  pay  plan.  The  sum  of  any  retroactive  payments  shall  be  paid  in  a  lump  sum,
without  interest,  as  part  of  the  first  monthly  payment  of  disability  benefits.  A  Local  51  Participant  shall  provide  such
reasonable  evidence  of  continued  Social  Security  disability  as  the  Committee  may  require  from  time  to  time.  Disability
benefits shall be discontinued  if the Local 51 Participant  ceases to qualify for disability  benefits  under the Social Security
Act.

(ii)        "Disability  Retirement  Date"  means  the  date  a  Participant  retires  before  his  Normal  Retirement  Date  in

accordance with the provisions of Section L(i).

(iii)        A  Local  51  Participant  who  retires  under  the  provisions  of  Section  L(i)  before  his  Normal  Retirement  Date
shall be entitled to receive for life, or as long as his disability continues to qualify under the Social Security Act, a monthly
retirement  income commencing  on his Disability  Retirement  Date in an amount equal to the benefit which he would have
received  pursuant  to  Section  D  based  on  his  Years  of  Service  and  Final  Average  Earnings  as  of  his  Disability  Retirement
Date,  without  reduction  for  early  commencement.  Notwithstanding  the  above,  if  a  Local  51  Participant  is  not  actively
employed (meaning engaged in work duties for the Employer) on or after July 1, 2012, his benefit shall be determined under
the provisions of the Plan in effect prior to July 1, 2012.

(iv)    A Local 51 Participant who becomes disabled, while actively employed, on or after attaining age 65, shall be

considered to have retired under Section D or Section E, as applicable, and will be entitled to a monthly retirement income, if any, in
an amount determined under Section D or E and Section 6.1(a), as applicable.

Participant shall be reduced, but after his death 100% of such reduced retirement income shall be paid for life to his
Spouse. The amount of reduced retirement income payable to the Participant shall be 80% of the amount otherwise
payable.  Such reduced retirement  income shall be further reduced,  or increased,  by 1% for each year by which the

the retirement income payable under this option be greater than that payable in the absence of an option.

(b)    50% Contingent Annuitant Option. The amount of retirement income to be paid to the Union Participant
shall be reduced, but after his death 50% of such reduced retirement income shall be paid for life to his Spouse. The
amount of reduced retirement income payable to the Participant shall be 90% of the amount otherwise payable. Such
reduced  retirement  income  shall  be  further  reduced,  or  increased,  by  1/2%  for  each  year  by  which  the  Union
Participant’s Spouse is more than five years younger, or older, than the Participant. However, in no event shall the
retirement income payable under this option be greater than that payable in the absence of an option.

(c)    Five-Year Certain Option. The amount of retirement income to be paid to the Union Participant shall be

shall be continued to his Beneficiary until a combined total of 60 monthly payments have been made. The amount of
reduced retirement income payable to the Participant shall be 98% of the amount otherwise payable to him.

APP-5-6

(d)    Ten-Year Certain Option. The amount of retirement income to be paid to the Union Participant shall be
reduced, but in the event of his death prior to receiving 120 monthly payments, the same amount of retirement income

be  reduced,  but  in  the  event  of  his  death  prior  to  receiving  180  monthly  payments,  the  same  amount  of  retirement
income shall be continued to his Beneficiary until a combined total of 180 monthly payments have been made. The
amount of reduced retirement income payable to the Participant shall be 88% of the amount otherwise payable to him.

(f)    Lump Sum Option. If the Actuarially Equivalent present value of a Union Participant’s vested Accrued

Benefit is less than $15,000, he may elect to receive his benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment.

G.        Death  Benefits.  The  provisions  of  this  Section  shall  apply  to  any  vested  Union  Participant  whether  or  not  he  has
terminated employment with the Employer. Sections 6.3 and 6.4 shall not apply to any Union Participant. In addition, the Automatic
Surviving Spouse Benefit under Section 6.1 of the Plan shall not apply to any Union Participant, however Section 6.2 Notice and
Election Procedures for Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, shall apply to all Union Participants.

(i)    Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA).

(a)    Death After Earliest Retirement Age. If a vested active or terminated vested Union Participant dies after
the Earliest Retirement Age (as defined below), the Participant’s Spouse or Beneficiary will receive the same benefit
that would be payable if the Participant had retired with an immediate QJSA on the day before his date of death.

(b)    Death Before Earliest Retirement Age If a vested active or terminated vested Union Participant dies on
or  before  the  Earliest  Retirement  Age,  the  Participant’s  Spouse  or  Beneficiary  will  receive  the  same  benefit  that
would be payable if the Participant had:

(1)    separated from service on the date of death,

(2)    survived to the Earliest Retirement Age,

APP-5-7

(3)    elected to receive an immediate QJSA at the Earliest Retirement Age, and

(4)    died on the day after the Earliest Retirement Age.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, if the value of the QPSA is less than $5,000, the Committee
shall direct the immediate distribution of the Actuarial Equivalent thereof in a single lump sum in cash to the Union
Participant’s Spouse or Beneficiary.

(c)    Reduction in Benefit. The benefit payable to the Spouse or Beneficiary will be reduced by 1/6 of one percent for
each month that the date of birth of the Spouse or Beneficiary is more than five years after the date of birth of the deceased
Union Participant.

(d)        Death  Benefit  after  Commencement  of  Benefits.  The  benefits,  if  any,  payable  as  a  result  of  death  after  the

commencement of benefits shall be governed by the payment option in effect in accordance with Section F.

(e)    Earliest Retirement Age, for the purpose of this Section, is the earliest date on which, under the Plan, the Union

Participant could elect to receive retirement benefits.

(f)    Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. For purposes of this Section, the definition of Qualified Joint and Survivor
Annuity set forth in Section A is changed by substituting the term “Beneficiary” in place of the term “Spouse” wherever it is
used therein.

(g)    Benefits Payable to Beneficiaries. The death benefit payable pursuant to the provisions of this Section G(i) shall
be payable to a Beneficiary only if the Union Participant has no Spouse, unless a valid spousal waiver has been obtained, in
accordance with Section G(ii)(d).

(ii)    Beneficiary Designation.

(a)    Each Union Participant shall have the right to designate one or more Beneficiaries and contingent Beneficiaries
to  receive  any  benefit  payable  under  Section  G(i)(d)  by  filing  a  written  designation  with  the  Committee  on  the  form
prescribed by the Committee.

(b)    If the Union Participant has elected an annuity with a contingent annuitant option, the election of the contingent

annuitant shall be irrevocable as of the Annuity Starting Date.

APP-5-8

(c)    If the Union Participant has elected an annuity with a guaranteed number of monthly payments or commuted
death  benefit,  such  Union  Participant  may  thereafter  designate  a  different  Beneficiary  to  receive  the  guaranteed  monthly
payments or commuted death benefit at any time by filing a new written designation with the Committee.

(d)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a married Union Participant designates a contingent annuitant or Beneficiary
other  than  his  Spouse  and  his  Spouse  does  not  consent  to  such  designation  in  writing  witnessed  by  a  notary  public  or  a
representative of the Committee in a manner prescribed by the Committee, then the Union Participant’s Spouse shall be the
Participant’s  sole  Beneficiary.  A  Spouse’s  consent  to  the  Union  Participant’s  Beneficiary  designation  given  in  accordance
with the Committee’s rules shall be irrevocable by the Spouse with respect to the Beneficiary then designated by the Union
Participant unless the Participant makes a new Beneficiary designation.

(e)        Any  written  designation  shall  become  effective  only  upon  its  receipt  by  the  Committee.  If  the  Beneficiary
designated pursuant to this Section should die on or before distribution of benefits and the Union Participant fails to make a
new designation, then his Beneficiary shall be determined pursuant to Section G(iii). The Beneficiary of guaranteed monthly
payments shall select the faun of distribution in accordance with Section G(iv).

(iii)    Beneficiary List.  If  (1)  a  Union  Participant  omits or  fails to  designate a  Beneficiary,  (2)  no  designated Beneficiary
survives the Union Participant or (3) the Committee determines that the Union Participant’s Beneficiary designation is invalid for
any reason, then any guaranteed monthly payments or commuted benefit payable after the death of the Union Participant shall be
paid to his Spouse, or if the Union Participant is not survived by his Spouse, then to his estate. If the Union Participant’s designated
Beneficiary  dies  after  the  Union  Participant,  but  before  distribution  of  all  guaranteed  monthly  payments,  then  the  balance  of  the
payments shall be paid to the Beneficiary’s estate.

(iv)    Manner and Form of Payment.

(a)    Death benefits under Section G shall be distributed over a period not extending beyond five years of the Union
Participant’s date of death unless (1) payment of benefits commenced in the form of an annuity under Section E before the
Union  Participant’s  date  of  death,  in  which  case  benefits  shall  be  distributed  at  least  as  rapidly  as  under  the  method  of
distribution  in  effect  on  the  Union  Participant’s  date  of  death,  or  (2)  the  benefit  is  payable  to  the  Union  Participant’s
designated  Beneficiary  and  the  projected  distribution  period  does  not  exceed  the  life  expectancy  of  such  Beneficiary,
provided distribution begins not later than one year after the date of the Participant’s death or such later date as applicable
regulations under the Code may permit.

APP-5-9

(b)        Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  Section,  if  the  value  of  the  death  benefit  is  less  than  $5,000,  the
Committee  shall  direct  the  immediate  distribution  of  the  Actuarial  Equivalent  thereof  in  a  single  lump  sum  in  cash  to  the
Union Participant’s Spouse or Beneficiary.

(v)    Distribution of Employee Contributions. If a Union Participant dies prior to retirement and his Spouse is not eligible for
a death benefit under Section G, his Beneficiary shall be paid a lump sum amount equal to the contributions, if any, which he made
to the Elizabethtown Plan, including interest. Interest will be compounded annually to the date of death based on the following rates:

(a)    from the date of contribution to December 31, 1987 at the rate of 5%;

(b)    from January 1, 1988 to the date of death at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate as in effect

under section 1274 of the Code for the first month of the Plan Year.

early retirement subsidy.”

2

6.    Effective January 1, 2019, Article IX of the Plan is amended to add the following new Section 9.5 to the end thereof to read as
follows:
