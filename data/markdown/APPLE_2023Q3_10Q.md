Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Apple Inc.

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”).
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect  all  adjustments,  which  are  normal  and  recurring  in  nature,  necessary  for  fair  financial  statement  presentation.  The  preparation  of  these  condensed
consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  those  estimates.  Certain  prior  period  amounts  in  the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed
consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Company’s  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  and
accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal
years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the
Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022

2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

Total net sales include $3.3 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of April 1, 2023, $3.1
billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended  June  25,  2022  that  was  included  in  deferred  revenue  as  of  March  26,  2022,  $7.0  billion  of  revenue
recognized in the nine months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $6.3 billion of revenue recognized in the
nine months ended June 25, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.

The  Company’s  proportion  of  net  sales  by  disaggregated  revenue  source  was  generally  consistent  for  each  reportable  segment  in  Note  10,  “Segment
Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue
represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As  of  July  1,  2023  and  September  24,  2022,  the  Company  had  total  deferred  revenue  of  $12.2  billion  and  $12.4  billion,  respectively. As  of  July  1,  2023,  the
Company expects 67% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 6% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater
than three years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

76,267

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may
choose  not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular
exposures.  There  can  be  no  assurance  the  hedges  will  offset  more  than  a  portion  of  the  financial  impact  resulting  from  movements  in  foreign  exchange  or
interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk

To  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  enter  into  forward  contracts,  option  contracts  or  other
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may  enter  into  forward  contracts,  cross-currency  swaps  or  other  instruments.  The  Company  designates  these  instruments  as  either  cash  flow  or  fair  value
hedges. As of July 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–
related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 8

The  Company  may  also  enter  into  derivative  instruments  that  are  not  designated  as  accounting  hedges  to  protect  gross  margins  from  certain  fluctuations  in
foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally
enters  into  collateral  security  arrangements  that  provide  for  collateral  to  be  received  or  posted  when  the  net  fair  values  of  certain  derivatives  fluctuate  from
contractually  established  thresholds.  To  further  limit  credit  risk,  the  Company  generally  enters  into  master  netting  arrangements  with  the  respective
counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party
to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of
collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized
businesses  and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;  however,  the
Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit
risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-
financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any
recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.

As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s
cellular network carriers accounted for 44% of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture
subassemblies  or  assemble  final  products  for  the  Company.  The  Company  purchases  these  components  directly  from  suppliers.  As  of  July  1,  2023,  the
Company  had  two  vendors  that  individually  represented  10%  or  more  of  total  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  which  accounted  for  54%  and  14%.  As  of
September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54%
and 13%.

Note 5 – Income Taxes

European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and
2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered
Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of
January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General
Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September
25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23,
2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any
incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.

Note 6 – Debt

Commercial Paper

The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a
material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This  section  and  other  parts  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  (“Form  10-Q”)  contain  forward-looking  statements,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on
certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding
the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”
“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly
from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,
Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  information  presented  herein  is  based  on  the  Company’s  fiscal  calendar,  and  references  to  particular  years,  quarters,  months  or
periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the
“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Available Information

The  Company  periodically  provides  certain  information  for  investors  on  its  corporate  website,  www.apple.com,  and  its  investor  relations  website,
investor.apple.com.  This  includes  press  releases  and  other  information  about  financial  performance,  information  on  environmental,  social  and  governance
matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not
incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The  Company  has  historically  experienced  higher  net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holiday
demand. Additionally,  new  product  and  service  introductions  can  significantly  impact  net  sales,  cost  of  sales  and  operating  expenses.  The  timing  of  product
introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product
launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.

Fiscal Period

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years
2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.

Quarterly Highlights

Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 1% or $1.2 billion during
the  third  quarter  of  2023  compared  to  the  same  quarter  in  2022.  The  year-over-year  net  sales  decrease  consisted  primarily  of  lower  net  sales  of  iPad  and
iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.

During the third quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products:

®

15-inch MacBook Air , powered by the M2 chip;

•
• Mac Studio™, powered by the M2 Max chip and the new M2 Ultra chip;
• Mac Pro , powered by the new M2 Ultra chip; and
•

®

Apple Vision Pro™, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024.

The Company also announced iOS 17, macOS  Sonoma, iPadOS  17, tvOS  17 and watchOS  10, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be
available in the fall of 2023.

The Company repurchased $18.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the third quarter of 2023.

Macroeconomic Conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future
materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower

the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.

The  Company’s  effective  tax  rate  for  the  third  quarter  of  2023  was  lower  compared  to  the  third  quarter  of  2022  due  primarily  to  a  lower  effective  tax  rate  on

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The  Company  believes  its  balances  of  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  unrestricted  marketable  securities,  along  with  cash  generated  by  ongoing  operations  and
continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.

Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The  Company  utilizes  several  outsourcing  partners  to  manufacture  subassemblies  for  the  Company’s  products  and  to  perform  final  assembly  and  testing  of
finished  products. The  Company  also  obtains  individual  components  for  its  products  from  a  wide  variety  of  individual  suppliers.  Outsourcing  partners  acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of July 1, 2023, the
Company  had  manufacturing  purchase  obligations  of  $38.4  billion,  with  $38.1  billion  payable  within  12  months.  The  Company’s  manufacturing  purchase
obligations are primarily noncancelable.

Capital Return Program

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company had authorized share repurchase programs as of July 1, 2023. The programs do not obligate the
Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of July 1, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to
increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form  10-Q  and  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  II,  Item  8  of  the  2022  Form  10-K  describe  the  significant  accounting  policies  and
methods  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Company’s  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements.  There  have  been  no  material  changes  to  the  Company’s
critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first nine months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market
risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2022 Form
10-K.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
financial  officer  have  concluded  that  the  Company’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities
Exchange Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  “Exchange Act”)  were  effective  as  of  July  1,  2023  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  required  to  be
disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and  (ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company’s  management,  including  its  principal  executive  officer  and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There  were  no  changes  in  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  during  the  third  quarter  of  2023,  which  were  identified  in  connection  with
management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings

Epic Games

Epic  Games,  Inc.  (“Epic”)  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  California  (the  “District  Court”)  against  the  Company  alleging
violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10,
2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain
provisions  of  the  Company’s  App  Store  Review  Guidelines  violate  California’s  unfair  competition  law  and  issued  an  injunction  enjoining  the  Company  from
prohibiting  developers  from  including  in  their  apps  external  links  that  direct  customers  to  purchasing  mechanisms  other  than  Apple  in-app  purchasing.  The
injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit
Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision.
On  June  30,  2023,  the  Circuit  Court  denied  both  petitions.  On  July  17,  2023,  the  Circuit  Court  granted Apple’s  motion  to  stay  enforcement  of  the  injunction
pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Epic has appealed the Circuit Court’s stay of the injunction. If the U.S. Supreme Court reverses the Circuit Court’s
stay of the injunction or declines Apple’s petition, the injunction will take effect.

Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The
Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting
period  for  amounts  above  management’s  expectations,  the  Company’s  financial  condition  and  operating  results  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  materially
adversely affected.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known
or  unknown,  including  those  described  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  the  2022  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  “Risk  Factors.”  When  any  one  or  more  of  these  risks
materialize  from  time  to  time,  the  Company’s  business,  reputation,  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  stock  price  can  be  materially  and  adversely
affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K.

materially affect, the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and

(a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably

likely to adversely affect the Registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

(b) Any  fraud,  whether  or  not  material,  that  involves  management  or  other  employees  who  have  a  significant  role  in  the  Registrant’s  internal
