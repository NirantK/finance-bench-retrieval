“The year is off to a positive start as the Ulta Beauty team delivered revenue, operating
margin, and diluted EPS consistent with our internal expectations. Store traffic remained
healthy, member growth showed continued strength, we delivered growth across key
categories, and we strengthened engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand,” said Dave
Kimbell, chief executive officer. “While we expect the operating environment to continue
evolving, we remain confident in the resilience of the beauty category and in our ability to
drive share and profitable growth with our proven business model, a diverse, best-in-class
assortment, an industry-leading loyalty program, and our world-class team.”

For the First Quarter of Fiscal 2023

Net sales increased 12.3% to $2.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion in the first quarter of
fiscal 2022 due to increased comparable sales, strong new store performance, and
growth in other revenue compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales)
increased 9.3% compared to an increase of 18.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022,
driven by an 11.0% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 12.1% to $1.1 billion compared to $941.0 million in the first
quarter of fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 40.0%
compared to 40.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher inventory
shrink, lower merchandise margins, higher supply chain costs, and deleverage of

salon expenses, partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store
fixed costs.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 22.2% to $612.1
million compared to $501.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As a percentage of
net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 23.2% compared to 21.4% in the first quarter
of fiscal 2022, primarily due to deleverage of store payroll and benefits, deleverage of
corporate overhead due to strategic investments, and deleverage of marketing
expenses, partially offset by leverage of incentive compensation and store expenses.
Operating income increased 1.0% to $442.1 million, or 16.8% of net sales, compared
to $437.7 million, or 18.7% of net sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Interest income, net increased to $7.3 million compared to interest expense, net of
$0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, due to higher average interest rates and
higher average cash balances during the quarter.
Tax rate decreased to 22.8% compared to 24.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022,
primarily due to benefits from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.
Net income increased 4.7% to $347.1 million compared to $331.4 million in the first
quarter of fiscal 2022.
Diluted earnings per share increased 9.2% to $6.88, including a $0.14 benefit due to
income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $6.30, including a
$0.02 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in the first
quarter of fiscal 2022.

Balance Sheet

Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $636.4 million.

Merchandise inventories, net at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased to $1.75
billion compared to $1.57 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase is
due to inventory to support higher demand, product cost increases, 41 net new stores, new
brand launches, and brand expansions.

Share Repurchase Program

During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 541,108 shares of its
common stock at a cost of $285.8 million, including excise tax. As of April 29, 2023, $816.5
million remained available under the $2.0 billion share repurchase program announced in
March 2022.

Store Update

Real estate activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 included five new stores located in
Boulder, CO; Denton, TX; Seattle, WA; Surprise, AZ; and Warrensville Heights, OH. In
addition, the Company closed one store, relocated one store, and remodeled two stores.

At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 the Company operated 1,359 stores totaling 14.2
