BUSINESS

PART
I

PG&E Corporation, incorporated in California in 1995, is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility

operating in northern and central California.  The Utility was incorporated in California in 1905.  PG&E Corporation became the holding company of the Utility and its
subsidiaries in 1997.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
operating revenues, income, and total assets can be found below in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

The principal executive offices of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are located at 77 Beale Street, P.O.   Box 770000, San Francisco, California   94177.  PG&E

Corporation’s telephone number is (415) 973-1000 and the Utility’s telephone number is (415)   973-7000.

At December 31, 2015, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had approximately 23,000 regular employees, approximately 20 of which were employees of the PG&E

Corporation .  Of the Utility’s regular employees, approximately 13,500 are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three labor unions:  the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”); the Engineers and Scientists of California (“ESC”); and the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU” ).   The
SEIU collective bargaining agreement will expire on July 31, 201 6 . The two agreements with IBEW will expire on December   31, 201 6 .   The agreement with ESC, originally
scheduled to expire on December 31, 2015, automatically renewed for a period of one year pending the negotiation of a new agreement with the union.  In January 2016, the
Utility and ESC reached a tentative new agreement, subject to ratification by members of ESC.   If ratified, the new agreement with ESC will be retroactive to January 1, 2016
and will expire on December 31, 2019 .

This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Annual Reports on Form   10-K,

Quarterly Reports on Form   10-Q, Current Reports on Form   8-K, and proxy statements, are available free of charge on both PG&E Corporation's website, www.pgecorp.com
,
and the Utility's website, www.pge.com
, as promptly as practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC .  The information contained on these websites is not part of
this or any other report that PG&E Corporation and the Utility files with, or furnishes to, the SEC.

In April 2015, the CPUC issued decisions in the three investigations that had been brought against the Utility relating to (1) the Utility’s safety record-keeping for its
natural gas transmission system, (2) the Utility’s operation of its natural gas transmission pipeline system in or near locations of higher population density, and (3) the Utility’s
pipeline installation, integrity management, record-keeping and other operational practices, and other events or courses of conduct, that could have led to or contributed to the
pipeline accident that occurred in San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010 (the “San Bruno accident”).  A decision was issued in each investigative proceeding to determine
the violations that the Utility committed.  The CPUC also approved a fourth decision (the “Penalty Decision”) to impose penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6 billion .  For more
information about the Penalty Decision see Item 1.A. Risk Factors and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. below.   The Utility also faces
criminal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under the
Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and that the Utility obstructed the N TSB ’s investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accident.  T he trial currently is scheduled to begin on
March 22, 2016.  F or more information about the criminal proceeding, s ee “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in MD&A , Item 1.A. Risk Factors, and Note 13 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. below .

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  For a discussion of the significant

risks that could affect the outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition and results of operations, see “Item
1A. Risk Factors” and the section entitled “Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in MD&A.

Regulatory
Environment

The Utility's business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.  At the state level, the Utility is regulated

primarily by the CPUC.  At the federal level, the Utility is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements of other federal,
state and local regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment and health. This section and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms” section below summarize some of the
more significant laws, regulations, and regulatory proc eedings affecting the Utility.

7

PG&E Corporation is a “public utility holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversight by the
FERC.  PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries are exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than the obligation to provide access
to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.

The
California
Public
Utilities
Commission

The CPUC consists of five members appointed by the Governor of California and confirmed by the California State Senate for staggered six-year terms.  The CPUC has

jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions of service for the Utility's electricity and natural gas distribution operations, electricity generation, and natural gas
transmission and storage services.  The CPUC also has jurisdiction over the Utility's issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf
of the Utility's electricity and natural gas retail customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used
in providing electric and natural gas utility service.

The CPUC enforces state laws and regulations that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utility gas

and electric facilities.   The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $50,000 per day, per violation, for violations that occurred after January 1, 2012.  (The statutory maximum
penalty for violations that occurred before January 1, 2012 is $20,000 per violation.)  The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of
the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and the good faith of the
entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC also is required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the
size of the entity charged.

As discussed above, i n April 2015, the CPUC concluded its three investigati ve enforcement actions against the Utility by imposing penalties totaling $1.6 billion. (For
more information about the Penalty Decision , see Item 1.A. Risk Factors and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. below.) The CPUC is also
conducting investigative enforcement proceedings relating to the Utility’s natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping practices and the Utility’s potential violations of the
CPUC’s ex parte communication rules.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in MD&A for more information.) Further, in August 2015, the CPUC began an investigation
into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and
achieve safety goals and standards. (For more information, see “ Regulatory Matters ” in MD&A.)

The CPUC has adopted separate gas and electric safety enforcement programs that authorize the SED to issue citations and impose fines for violations of certain
regulations.   Under both the gas and electric programs, the SED is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty o f $50,000 for each separate violation and has the
discretion to impose daily fines for continuing violations.  During 2016, the CPUC is expected to develop and implement improvements and refinements to the electric and gas
safety citation programs, including steps to reconcile the differences between the two programs.

The California State Legislature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to increasing renewable energy resources, the

development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the development of energy storage
technologies and facilities, and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  T he CPUC is responsible for approving funding and administration of
state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs.  The CPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Utility’s accounting,
performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines .

T he CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financial conditions

that require PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility's
obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in MD&A and Item 1A. Risk
Factors.)

The
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
and
the
California
Independent
System
Operator

The FERC has jurisdiction over the Utility's electricity transmission revenue requirements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility's hydroelectric

generation facilities, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s transmission systems with other electric
systems and generation facilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesale electricity sales.  The FERC
also is charged with adopting and enforcing mandatory standards governing the reliability of the nation’s electricity transmission grid, including standards to protect the nation’s
bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The FERC has authority to impose fines of up to $1 million per day for violation of
certain federal statutes and regulations.

The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmission organization for the Utility’s service territory.  The CAISO controls the operation of the electricity

transmission system in California and provides open access transmission service on a non - discriminatory basis.  The CAISO also is responsible for planning transmission
system additions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of generation capacity, and ensuring that the reliability of the transmission system is maintained.

The
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission

The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo

Canyon and the Utility’s retired nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay.  (See “Electric ity Resources” below.)  NRC regulations require extensive monitoring and review of
the safety, radiological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or to force a
shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both.  NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capital expenditures at Diablo Canyon, and substantial
capital expenditures could be required in the future.   For more information about Diablo Canyon, see “Regulatory Matters – Diablo Canyon” in MD&A and Item 1.A Risk
Factors below.)

Other
Regulation

The CEC is the state's primary energy policy and planning agency.  The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.  The

CEC also is responsible for forecasts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities' electricity procurement plans.

The CARB is the state agency charged with setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits.  The CARB also is responsible for adopting and enforcing
regulations to implement state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California.  (See “Environmental Regulation — Air Quality and Climate Change” below.)

In addition, the Utility obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility's generation facilities, electricity

transmission lines, natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities.  The Utility also periodically obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses in
connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for the operation of the Utility's business and to
conduct certain related operations.  The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties that permit the Utility to install, operate, and maintain the
Utility's electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highway s.  In exchange for the right to use public streets and highway s, the Utility pays annual fees to the
cities and counties.  In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term, with no expiration date.

Ratemaking
Mechanisms

The Utility’s rates for electricity and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service including a
return on invested capital (“cost-of-service ratemaking”).  Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the annual amount that the Utility will
be authorized to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”).  The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to recover
its reasonable operating expenses ( e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs ( e.g., depreciation, tax, and financing expenses).  In addition, the
CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that it is allowed to “pass-through” to customers (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact
Earnings” in MD&A) , including its costs to procure electricity, natural gas and nuclear fuel, to administer public purpose and customer programs, and to decommission its
nuclear facilities.

9

The Utility’s rate of return on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings.  The authorized rate of return on all other assets is set in the

CPUC’s cost of capital proceeding.  Other than its electric transmission and certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base revenues are “decoupled” from its
sales volume.  Regulatory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, ensure that the Utility will fully collect its authorized base revenue requirements.  The
Utility’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impact ed Earnings” in MD&A)
within its authorized base revenue requirements.

Both gas and electric rates vary depending on seasons mostly due to the influence of weather.  Gas service rates generally increase during the winter months (October

through March) to account for the gas peak due to heating while electricity rates increase during summer (June – September) because of higher summer costs, driven by air
conditioning loads.

During 2015, the CPUC continued to implement state law requirements to reform residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of service,

reduce cross-subsidization among customer rate classes, implement new rules and rates for net energy metering (which currently allow certain self-generating customers to
receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate) , and allow customers to have greater control over their energy use.  (See “Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” in
MD&A for additional information on specific CPUC proceedings . )

From time to time, the CPUC may use incentive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues.  For example, the
Utility has earned incentives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.  (See “Results of Operations” in MD&A.)   These mechanisms can also create
financial risk.   For a discussion of the re-opened proceeding to review incentive revenues awarded for the 2006-2008 energy efficiency cycle, see “Rehearing of CPUC
Decisions Approving Energy Efficiency Incentive Awards” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. below.

Base
Revenues

General
Rate
Cases

The GRC is the primary proceeding in which the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect from customers to

recover the Utility’s anticipated costs, including return on rate base, related to its electricity distribution, natural gas distribution , and Utility owned electricity generation
operations.  The CPUC generally conducts a GRC every three years.  The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year (or “test year”) of the GRC period
and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases (known as “attrition rate adjustments”) in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period.
Attrition rate adjustments are generally provided for cost increases related to increases in invested capital and inflation .  Parties in the Utility's GRC include the ORA and
TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as a myriad of other intervenors who represent residential and other customer interests.

For more information about the Utility’s current GRC proceeding, see “ Regulatory Matters −2017 General Rate Case” in MD&A.

Natural
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Cases

The CPUC determines the Utility’s authorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.  In its 2015

GT&S rate case, the Utility has request ed that the CPUC approve a total annual revenue requirement of $1.2 63 billion for the Utility’s anticipated costs of providing natural gas
transmission and storage services for 2 015.  The Utility also requested revenue increases of $83 million in 2016 and $142 million in 2017. See “ Regulatory Matters – 2015 Gas
Transmission and Storage Rate Case” in MD&A for additional information.

10

Cost
of
Capital
Proceedings

The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of capital proceeding to authorize the Utility's capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric and natural

gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base.  The CPUC has authorized the Utility’s capital structure through 2017, consisting of 52% common equity,
47% long-term debt, and 1% preferred stock.  The CPUC also set the authorized ROE at 10.40%.  The CPUC also adopted an adjustment mechanism to allow the Utility’s capital
structure and ROE to be adjusted if the utility bond index changes by certain thresholds on an annual basis.  During 2015, the adjustment mechanism was not triggered so the
Utility’s authorized ROE will remain at 10.40% for 2016.  On February 12, 2016, a proposed decision was issued, that, if approved by the CPUC, will preclude the Utility from
using the mechanism before its next cost of capital application.   As a result, if the proposed decision is approved, the Utility’s capital structure and ROE will not be adjusted for
2017.   The CPUC will review the Utility’s capital st ructure and ROE for 2018 in the Utility’s next cost of capital proceeding.  The Utility is required to file its 2018 cost of
capital application by April 20, 2017 .

Owner
Rate
Cases

The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirement s , including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in rates

in the TO rate case.  The Utility generally files a TO rate case every year.  The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue
requirement, subject to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision.  These FERC-approved rates are included : 1) by the CPUC in the Utility's retail electric rates and are
collected from retail electric customers ; and 2) by the CAISO in its Transmission Access Charges to wholesale customers .  (See “ Regulatory Matters – FERC TO Rate Cases”
in MD&A.)  The Utility also recovers a portion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific contracts with
wholesale transmission customers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations.  These wholesale customers are charged individualized rates based on the
terms of their contracts.

Electricity
Procurement
Costs

California investor-owned electric utilities are responsible for procuring electricity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reserve margins, that are

not satisfied from their own generation facilities and existing electricity contracts.  The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric generation resources,
including electricity procured from third parties or the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources are the least expensive (i.e., using the principles
of “least-cost dispatch”).  In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their procurement plans based on long-term demand forecasts.  T he CPUC has
approved the Utility’s procurement plan covering 2012 through 202 4 .

California law allows electric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved electricity procurement plans without further after-the-fact
reasonableness review by the CPUC .  The CPUC may disallow c osts associated with electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approved
plan or if the CPUC determines that the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch.

The Utility recovers its electricity procurement costs annually primarily through the energy resource recovery account .  (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.) Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative instruments, GHG
emissions costs, and generation fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement.  The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electricity rates more frequently if the
forecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the energy resource recovery account exceed 5% of its prior year electricity procurement and utility-owned
generation revenues.  The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the energy resource recovery account.

The CPUC has approved various power purchase agreements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approved

procurement plan, to meet mandatory renewable energy targets , and to comply with resource adequacy requirements.  For additional information, s ee “Electric Utility
Operations – Electricity Resources” below as well as Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Natural
Gas
Procurement
and
Transportation
Costs

The Utility sets the natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecasted

costs of natural gas, core pipeline capacity and storage costs.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost of derivative
instruments through its retail gas rates that are subject to limits as set forth in its core procurement incentive mechanism, described below .  The Utility reflects the difference
between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancing accounts, with under-collections and over-collections taken
into account in subsequent monthly rate change s.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail
electricity rates.

The core procurement incentive mechanism protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs.  Under the core procurement

incentive mechanism , the Utility’s natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based benchmark based on a weighted average of
published monthly and daily natural gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas.  Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99% to
102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’ rates.  One-half of the costs above 102% of the benchmark are recoverable
in customers’ rates, and the Utility's customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings resulting from the Utility’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark.
The Utility retains the remaining amount of savings as incentive revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs.  While this mechanism remains in
place, changes in the price of natural gas, consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact net income.

The Utility incurs transportation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers.  These providers transport

natural gas from the points at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States) to the points at
which the Utility's natural gas transportation system begins.   These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules, and terms of service for the
provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines.  The FERC approves the United States tariffs that shippers , including the
Utility, pay for pipeline service , and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the Alberta Utilities Commission and the National Energy Board.  The transportation costs
the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas procurement costs or as a cost of electricity.

Costs
Associated
with
Public
Purpose
and
Customer
Programs

The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utility customers.

  These programs relate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters.   Additionally, the CPUC has
authorized the Utility to provide a discount rate for low-income customers, known as California Alternate Rates for Energy (“CARE”), which is subsidized by the Utility’s other
customers.

Nuclear
Decommissioning
Costs

The Utility's nuclear power facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the safe
removal of nuclear facilities from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the property for
unrestricted use.  Nuclear decommissioning costs are collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual
decommissioning of each nuclear unit.  The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’s updated estimated decommissioning
costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission the Utility’s nuclear plants.

Electric
Utility
Operations

The Utility generates electricity and provides electricity transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California to
residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers.  The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission and distribution services) to most customers
in its service territory.  Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generation resources, such as rooftop
solar installations.

12

As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, the Utility filed its proposed electric distribution resources plan for approval by the CPUC. The Utility’s plan identifies

optimal locations on its electric distribution system for deployment of distributed energy resources.  The Utility’s proposal is designed to allow energy technologies to be
interconnected with each other and integrated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.  The Utility envisions a
future electric grid, titled the Grid of Things™, that would allow customers to choose new advanced energy supply technologies and services to meet their needs consistent with
safe, reliable and affordable electric service.  The CPUC also is considering the Utility’s request for approval of the phased deployment of an electric vehicle charging
infrastructure in response to the CPUC’s December 2014 decision adopting a policy to expand the California utilities’ role in developing an EV charging infrastructure to support
California’s climate goals.  (For more information, see “ Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” in MD&A.)

Electricity
Resources

The Utility is required to maintain generating capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and

operating reserves, deliverable to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service.  The Utility is required to dispatch, or schedule all of the
electricity resources within its portfolio in the most cost-effective way .

The following table shows the percentage of the Utility’s total deliveries of electricity to customers in 201 5 represented by each major electricity resource, and further

discussed below.

Renewable
Energy
Resources
.  California law established a “renewable portfolio standard” (referred to as “RPS”) that requires load-serving entities, such as the Utility,
to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to their customers .  I n October 2015, the California Governor signed SB 350 , the Clean Energy and Pollution
Reduction Act of 2015 which, effective January 1, 2016, increases the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving entities, including the Utility, to
their customers from 33% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030
compliance period and in each compliance period thereafter.  SB 350 establishes increasing interim renewable energy targets for the periods between 2020 and 2030 but also
provides compliance flexibility and waiver mechanisms, including increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future
compliance periods.  The Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets which the Utility expects will continue to be
recoverable from customers as “pass-through” costs. The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets.  The CPUC has stated its intent to propose
a decision in late 2016 implementing SB 350’s provisions requiring higher RPS targets and other changes made by the statute to the RPS rules.

Renewable generation resources, for purposes of the RPS requirements , include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW or less),

wind, solar, and geothermal energy.  During 2015, 29.5 % of the Utility’s energy deliveries were from renewable energy sources, exceeding the annual RPS target of 23.3%.
Approximately 2 5 % of the renewable energy delivered to the Utility’s customers was purchased from non-QF third parties.   Additional renewable resources were provided by
QFs (3. 0 %), the Utility’s small hydroelectric facilities (0. 7 %), and the Utility’s solar facilities (0. 4 %).

Energy
Storage.

As required by California law, the CPUC has established initial energy storage procurement targets to be achieved by each load-serving entity, such as

the Utility.  The Utility must hold Requests for Offers (RFOs) to meet biennial targets and procure 580 MW of energy storage which must be operational by the end of 2024.
The Utility’s 2014-2015 energy storage procurement target was 80.5 MW.  The Utility initiated its RFO on December 1, 2014 to obtain at least 74 MW o f transmission and
distribution connected energy storage, signed contracts for 75 MW, and submitted those contracts for CPUC approval on the CP UC’s December 1, 2015 deadline.  The Utility
met its remaining 6.5 MW customer-connected target by funding energy storage under the CPUC-mandated Self Generation Incentive Program. On January 1, 2016, the Utility
reported its compliance with its 2014-2015 obligations to the CPUC.  The Utility must file its 2016-2017 plan for procuring 120 MW of energy storage, consisting of 105 MW of
transmission and distribution energy storage and 15 MW of customer-connected storage, by March 1, 2016.  A CPUC decision on the Utility’s plan is expected before the
December 1, 2016 deadline for the Utility to issue its second energy storage RFO.  The Utility continues to participate in the CPUC proceeding to refine California’s energy
storage program, which is considering potentially higher targets and expanded energy storage use cases.

Parties.

The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable

energy resources, in accordance with its CPUC-approved procurement plan.  (See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” above.)  For more information regarding the Utility’s power
purchase agreements, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Electricity
Transmission

At December   31, 201 5 , the Utility owned approximately 18, 4 00 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500
kV.  The Utility also opera ted 91 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 63,400 MVA.  The Utility’s electric transmission system is interconnected
with electric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Co uncil, which includes many western states, Alberta and British Columbia, and parts of Mexico.

In 2013, the Utility, MidAmerican Transmission, LLC, and Citizens Energy Corporation were selected by the CAISO to jointly develop a new 230-kV transmission line

to address the growing power demand in Fresno, Madera and Kings counties area.  The 70-mile line will connect the Utility-owned and -operated Gates and Gregg substations.
The new line will help reduce the number and duration of power outages, improve voltage in the area, support economic development, and bolster efforts to integrate clean,
renewable energy onto the grid.  The transmission line is expected to commence operations by 2022, and could come online earlier.

Throughout 201 5 , the Utility upgraded several critical substations and re-conductored a number of transmission lines to improve maintenance and system flexibility,

reliability and safety.  The Utility expects to undertake various additional transmission projects over the next several years to upgrade and expand the capacity of its transmission
system to accommodate system load growth, secure access to renewable generation resources, replace aging or obsolete equipment and improve system reliability.  The Utility
also has taken steps to improve the physical security of its transmission substations and equipment.

15

Electricity
Distribution

The Utility's electricity distribution network consists of a pproximately 142,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which approximately 20% are underground and

approximately 80% are overhead), 58 transmission switching substations, and 603 distribution substations, with a capacity of approximately 31,400 MVA.  The Utility’s
distribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations, where equipment reduces the high-voltage transmissio n
voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers.

These distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network.  Emanating from each substation are primary and secondary

distribution lines connected to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users.  In some cases, the Utility sells
electricity from its distribution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity.  In 2015 the Utility commenced operations in a new electric
distribution control center facilit y in Rocklin , California, and expects to complete an additional facility in Concord, California, in 2016.  These control centers form a key part of
the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more resilient grid.

In 2015, the Utility continued to deploy its Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration circuit technology which involves the rapid operation of s mart s witches

to reduce the duration of customer outages.   Another 83 circuits were outfitted with this equipment, bringing the total deployment to 700 of the Utility ’s 3200 distribution
circuits.   The Utility also installed o r replaced 20 distribution substation transformer banks to improve reliability and provide capacity to accommodate growing demand.   The
Utility pl ans to continue performing work to improve the reliability and safety of its electricity distribution operations in 2016 .

Natural
Gas
Utility
Operations

The Utility provides natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,
industrial, large commercial, and natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.   Core customers can
purchase natural gas procurement service (i.e. ,
natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement service providers (referred to as core
transport agents).   When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gas delivery, metering and billing services to
customers.     When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combined service as “bundled” natural gas service.   Currently,
more th an 91% o f core customers, representing n early 80% of the annual core market demand, receive bundled natural gas service from the Utility.

The Utility does not provide procurement service to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers.  The Utility offers backbone
gas transmission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-core customers.   Access to the Utility's
backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.   The Utility also delivers gas to off-system customers (
i.e ., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.

Natural
Gas
Supplies

The Utility can receive natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and the
southwestern United States.  The Utility also is supplied by natural gas fields in California.  The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customers directly from producers
and marketers in both Canada and the United States.  The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gas purchase contracts have fluctuated
generally based on market conditions.  During 201 5 , the Utility purchased appr oximately 307,100 MMcf o f natural gas (net of the sale of excess supply of gas).  Substantially
all this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less.  The Utility’s largest individual supplier represented approximately 17 % of the total natural gas
volume the Utility purchased during 201 5 .

Natural
Gas
System
Assets

The Utility owns and operates an integrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California.  At

December 31, 201 5 , the Utility’s natural gas system consisted of approximately 42, 800 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6, 7 00 miles of backbone and local transmission
pipelines, and various storage facilities.  The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system and one small station on its
local transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines.  The Utility’s backbone transmission system, composed primarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401,
is used to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, and California gas fields to the Utility’s local transmission
and distribution systems.

The Utility has firm transportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA Gas

Transmission,   Ltd. and TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines   Ltd., B.C. System.  These companies’ pipeline systems connect at the border to the pipeline system owned by Gas
Transmission Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system on the Oregon-
California border near Malin, Oregon.  The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline, LLC to transport this gas from the U.S Rocky Mountains to the
interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin, Oregon, at the California border, and firm transportation agreements with
Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC and El Paso Natural Gas Company to transport this natural gas from supply points in the U.S. Southwest to interconnection points with the
Utility's natural gas transportation system in the area of California near Topock, Arizona.  The Utility also has a transportation agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission
Company to transport gas from the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas system in the area of Daggett, California.  For more
information regarding the Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The Utility owns and operates three underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to the Utility’s

transmission system.   The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for storage and later
withdrawal.   In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility's northern California transmission system.

17

During 201 5 , the Utility conducted an annual system-wide review of its transmission pipeline class location designations .  The Utility also continued work to install

217 automatic and remote control shut-off valves on its gas transmission system , as specified in the eleventh of twelve safety recommendations made by the NTSB following its
investigation of the San Bruno accident.  As of December 31, 2015, the Utility had installed 235 automatic and remote control shut-off valves , and the NTSB closed that
recommendation .  The final safety recommendation, considered open and acceptable by the NTSB, involves hydrostatic testing nearly 1,000 miles of the Utility’s gas
transmission system.   The Utility has completed the majority of this task and currently plans to complete the task for the remaining approximately 100 of pipelines (involving
primarily short pipeline segments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmission pipelines) during 2018.   Also, as part of the
Utility’s distribution integrity management program, the Utility completed approximately 23,500 sewer inspections during 2015 to identify and correct conflicts between gas and
waste water facilities.

California law allows qualifying non-residential electric customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather than
from the utilities up to certain annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility.   T his arrangement is known as “direct access.”     In addition, California
law permits cities, counties, and certain other public agencies that have qualified to become a “community choice aggregator” (or “CCA”) to generate and/or purchase electricity
for their local residents and businesses.   By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents who do not affirmatively elect to continue to receive electricity from a
utility.

18

The Utility continues to provide transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers, although these customers can choose to obtain

metering and billing services from their energy service provider.  The CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services from the
Utility.  In addition to collecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect charges to recover the
generation-related costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of direct access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. The Utility remains the electricity
provider of last r esort for these customers.

In some circumstances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute to provide retail

electric service, may seek to acquire the Utility’s distribution facilities, either under a consensual transaction or via eminent domain.

The Utility is also impacted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage.  The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily

solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing.

The Utility also competes for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its service territory

through a competitive bidding process managed by the CAISO.

Competition
in
the
Natural
Gas
Industry

The Utility primarily competes with other natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis of

transportation rates, access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services.  The Utility also competes for storage services
with other third-party storage providers, primarily in northern California.

Environmental
Regulation

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of

the Utility's personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and radioactive substances; the
discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of carbon dio xide (CO ­ 2 ) and other GHG emissions; the transportation, handling, storage and
disposal of spent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penalties for violation of these laws and
requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions.  These laws and requirements also may require the Utility, under certain
circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)  Generally, the Utility recovers most of the costs of complying with environmental laws and
regulations in the Utility's rates, subject to reasonableness review.  Environmental costs associated with the clean-up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subject
to a special ratemaking mechanism described in Note 1 3 : Contingencies—Environmental Remediation Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8.

Hazardous
Waste
Compliance
and
Remediation

The Utility's facilities are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,

Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended.  The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted by the EPA, the federal agency responsible for implementing the
federal environmental laws.  The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted by the State of California and various state and local agencies.
These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1) owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies
that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in some cases, their corporate successors.  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act , these persons (known as “potentially responsible parties”) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous
substances, paying for the harm caused to natural resources, and paying for the costs of required health studies.

19

The Utility has a comprehensive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  Under federal and California laws, the Utility may

be responsible for remediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site.  The Utility’s remediation activities are overseen by the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.  The Utility has incurred
significant environmental remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gas compressor
stations are located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances.  Groundwater at the Utility’s Hinkley and Topock
natural gas compressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices.  The Utility is responsible for remediating this groundwater
contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.

For more information about environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Air
Quality
and
Climate
Change

The Utility's electricity generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws, including the
federal Clean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes.  These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone,
CO 2 , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), mono-nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter, and other GHG emissions.

In December 2009, the EPA concluded that GHG emissions contribute to climate change and issued a finding that GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution

that endangers public health and welfare.   In May 2014, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (a confederation of the research arms of thirteen federal departments and
agencies) released its third National Climate Assessment, which stated that the global climate is changing and that impacts related to climate change are already evident in many
sectors and are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond.

Federal
Regulation
.  At the federal level, the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.  Although there have been several legislative

attempts to address climate change through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted.  In the
absence of federal legislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.

In August 2015, the EPA published final regulations under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act to control CO 2 emissions from new fo ssil fuel-fired power plants.

While these regulations do not affect the Utility’s existing power plants, the regulations impose emission limitations on fossil fuel-fired power plants constructed after January 8,
2014 and will affect the design, construction, operation and cost of such power plants.

I n August 2015 , the EPA also published final regulations under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to control CO 2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power

plants .  These regulations are designed to reduce power plant CO 2 em issions on a national basis by as much as 32% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.  States must submit
final plans to comply with the se regulations by September 2016, but may request an extension to file such plans until September 2018. It is uncertain whether and how these
federal regulations will ultimately impact California, since existing state regulation currently requires, among other things, the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to
1990 levels by 2020.   Following publication of the EPA’s regulations , in October 2015 West Virginia and several other states and parties challenged the EPA’s section 111(d)
regulations in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and petitioned the Court to stay the regulations pending review of the appeal on the merits.
The D.C. Circuit denied the request for stay but in February 2016, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay of the section 111(d) regulations pending review of the appeal
by the D.C. Circuit.  The Supreme Court’s decision may affect the nature, extent and timing of implementat ion of these regulations.  As described below, the Utility expects all
costs and revenues associated with the state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers.

20

State
Regulation.

California ’s AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, provides for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by

2020.  The CARB has approved various regulations to achieve the 2020 target , including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program that
sets gradually declining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of the economy.  The cap - and-
trade program’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electricity generation and large industrial sectors.  The next compliance period, which
began on January 1, 2015, expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors, effectively covering all the economy’s major sectors until 2020.  The Utility’s
compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of natural gas delivered to the Utility’s customers other than natural
gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own compliance obligation.  During each year of the program, the CARB issues emission
allowances (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowed for that year.  Emitters can obtain allowances from the CARB at quarterly auctions or
from third parties or exchanges.  Emitters may also satisfy a portion of their compliance obligation through the purchase of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductions
achieved by third parties (such as landowners, livestock owners, and farmers) that occur outside of the emitters’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as
reforestation or biomass projects.  During 2016, CARB and the California Legislature are likely to consider proposals to achieve additional GHG reductions beyond the 2020
target established in AB 32.  The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers.  The California RPS
program that requires the utilities to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHG emissions in California.

Climate
Change
Mitigation
and
Adaptation
Strategies.
During 201 5 , the Utility continued its programs to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s

operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and to plan for the actions that it will need to take to adapt to the likely impacts of climate change on the
Utility’s future operations.  The Utility regularly reviews the most relevant scientific literature on climate change such as sea level rise, temperature changes, rainfall and runoff
patterns, and wildfire risk, to help the Utility identify and evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary adaptation strategies.  The Utility maintains emergency
response plans and procedures to address a range of near-term risks, including extreme storms, heat waves and wildfires and uses its risk-assessment process to prioritize
infrastructure investments for longer-term risks associated with climate change. The Utility also engages with leaders from business, government, academia, and non-profit
organizations to share information and plan for the future.

With respect to electric operations, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demand due to

more extreme, persistent, and frequent hot weather.  The Utility believes its str ategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demand response programs,
infrastructure improvements, and the use of rene wable energy and energy storage are effective strategies for adapting to the expected increase in demand for electricity.  The
Utility is making substantial investments to build a more modern and resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather and related emergencies.   The Utility’s
vegetation management activities also reduce the risk of wildfire impacts on electric and gas facilities.  Over the long-term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding and
inundation potential at coastal and low elevation facilities due to sea level rise combined with high tides, storm runoff and storm surges.

Climate scientists also predict that climate change will result in significant reductions in snowpack in parts of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  This could, in turn, affect

the Utility’s hydroelectric generation.  To plan for this potential change, the Utility is engaging with state and local stakeholders and is also adopting strategies such as
maintaining higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases, and collaborating on research and new modeling tools.

With respect to natural gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane into the
atmosphere.  The Utility has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reduce the pressure and
volume of natural gas within pipelines prior to venting.   In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in methane emissions by implementing improvements in leak
detection and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipeline materials.

21

Emissions
Data

PG&E Corporation and the Utility track and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas.  The Utility reports its GHG

emissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a voluntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The Climate Registry, a non-
pro fit organization.  The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2014 totaled more than 58 milli on metric tonnes of CO ­ 2
equivalent , nearly two-thirds of which came from customer natural gas use.  The following table shows the 201 4 GHG emissions data the Utility reported to the CARB under
AB 32 . PG&E Corporation and the Utility publish additional GHG emissions data in their annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

On May 19, 2014, the EPA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electric

power plants, such as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.   Various industry
and environmental groups have challenged the federal regulations in proceedings pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  California’s once-through cooling
policy discussed below is considered to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations.  Therefore, California’s implementation process for the state policy will likely
continue without any significant change.

22

At the state level,   in 2010 the California Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other

significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.   As required by the policy the California Water
Board appointed a committee to evaluate the feasibility and cost of using alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon.   The committee’s consultant
submitted its final report to the California Water Board in September 2014 and the board is not expected to issue a final decision regarding Diablo Canyon’s compliance with the
state policy before January 2017 .  If the California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible,
the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge.   Even if the Utility is not required to install cooling towers, it could incur
significant costs to comply with alternative compliances measures or to make payments to support various environmental mitigation projects. The Utility would seek to recover
such costs in rates.  The Utility’s Diablo Canyon operations must be in compliance with the California Water Board’s policy by December 31, 2024.

The final requirements of the federal and state cooling water policies could affect future negotiations between the Central Coast Board and the Utility regarding the

status of the 2003 settlement agreement.  (See “Diablo Canyon Power Plant” in Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.)

Nuclear
Fuel
Disposal

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts under which
the DOE would be required to dispose of the utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by the utilities’ customers.
The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the
retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay.  As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store its spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at Humboldt
Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel.  The Utility and other nuclear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs that
they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel.

In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that awarded the Utility $266 million for spent fuel storage costs
incurred through December 31, 2010.  The settlement agreement also provided a claims process by which the Utility submits annual requests for reimbursement of its ongoing
spent fuel storage costs.  In 2015 , the Utility was awarded an additional $ 21 million for costs incurred between June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014 .  The claim for the period June
1, 2014 through May 31, 2015 is under review by the DOE.  These proceeds are being refunded to customers through rates.  The settlement agreement, as amended, does not
address costs incurred for spent fuel storage beyond 2016 and such costs could be subject to future litigation.  Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when and
whether the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.

ITEM
1A.
RISK
FACTORS

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results can be affected by many factors , including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies

described in MD&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results .   T he following
discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the
consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K .  Any of these factors , in whole or in
part, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, results of operations , financial condition, a nd stock price.

Risks
Related
to
the
Outcome
of
Enforcement
Matters,
Investigations,
and
Regulatory
Proceedings

PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
future
financial
results
may
be
materially
affected
by
the
outcome
of
the
federal
criminal
prosecution
of
the
Utility.

As discussed in MD&A, the Utility is facing federal criminal charges alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under the

Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and alleging t hat the Utility illegally obstructed the NTSB’s investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accident that occurred on September
9, 2010 .  The maximum statutory fine for each felony count is $500,000, for potential total fines of $ 6.5 million.  The federal prosecutor also seeks to impose an alternative
fine which could total approximately $ 562 m illion , b ased on allegations that the Utility derived gross gains of approximately $281 million .  The trial currently is scheduled
to begin on March 22 , 2016.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not recorded any charges for potential criminal fines in their consolidated f inancial statements at December 31, 2015.  If the

Utility is convicted and a fine is imposed, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will record charges when required in accordance with GAAP.  The Utility also could incur
material costs, not recoverable through rates, to implement remedial measures that may be imposed by the court, such as a requirement that the Utility’s natural gas operations
be supervised by a third-party monitor . The Utility could also be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs.

If the Utility incurred material fines or costs following a conviction, PG&E Corporation may need to issue common stock to raise funds to contribute to the Utility to

maintain the required equity component of the Utility’s authorized capital structure as the Utility incur charges and costs.  These issuances would be incremental to PG&E
Corporation’s current forecast of common stock issuances and could materially dilute PG&E Corporation’s EPS.  The trial and any negative publicity associated with it, as well
as the Utility’s conviction and the imposition of a material fine, if incurred, also could affect the Utility’s and PG&E Corporation’s credit ratings or outlooks and make it more
difficult for PG&E Corporation and the Utility to access the capital markets.

The trial and the Utility’s conviction could harm the Utility’s relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and

make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management.  Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings
; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges .

In addition, the Utility’s conviction could result in increased regulatory or legislative pressure to require the separation of the Utility’s electric and natural gas
businesses, restructure the corporate relationship between PG&E Corporation and the Utility, or undergo some other fundamental corporate restructuring.  As discussed under
the heading “Regulatory Matters” in MD&A, the SED will evaluate PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s organizational structure in the CPUC’s pending investigation to
examine the Utility’s safety culture.

PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
future
financial
results
may
be
materially
affected
by
the
outcome
s
of
the
CPUC’s
investigative
enforcement
proceedings

against
the
Utility,
other
known
enforcement
matters,
and
other
ongoing
state
and
federal
investigations.

The
Utility
also
could
incur
material
costs
and
fines
in
connection
with
future
investigations,
citations,
audits,
or
enforcement
actions.

The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the CPUC’s investigation s of the Utility’s compliance with natural gas

distribution record-keeping practices and th e Utility’s compliance with the CPUC’s rules regarding ex parte communications .  In addition, there are several other
investigations by f ederal and state law enforcement authorities .  The Utility was informed that the U.S. Attorney’s Office was investigating a natural gas explosion that
occurred in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco also continues to investigate matters relating to the indicted case discussed
above.  Federal and state law enforcement authorities also have been investigating matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC
personnel.   If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties or suffer negative consequences described
above in the immediately preceding risk factor .   In addition , a   negative outcome in any of these investigations or future enforcement actions may negatively affe c t the
outcom e of fut u re rat e making and regul a to ry proceeding s; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are
somehow related to the Utility’s violations.

24

The SED also could impose material fines on the Utility based on the Utility’s self-reports submitted in accordance with the SED’s safety citation program and the

Utility’s efforts to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights of way.   The Penalty Decision r equires the SED to review the Utility’s gas
transmission operations (including t he Utility’s compliance with the remedies ordered by the Penalty Decision) and to perform annual audits of the Utility’s record-keeping
practices for a minimum of ten years. T he SED could impose f ines on the Utility or require the Utility to incur unrecoverable costs, or both, based on the outcome of the se
future audits . In addition, although PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not currently face the possibility of fines or penalties in the first phase of the CPUC’s pending
investigation into the Utility’s safety culture since it has been categorized as rate setting, it is uncertain how the next phase will be categorized.  (See the discussion under the
heading “Regulatory Matters” in MD&A.)

The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws,
regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements;
customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices;
and federal electric reliability standards .  The SED could impose fines on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation
programs.  The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.

PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
future
financial
results
could
be
materially
affected
by
the
extent
to
which
its
natural
gas
transmission
costs
exceed

authorized
revenues
as
the
Utility
complies
with
the

Decision
a
nd
incurs
other
natural
gas
transmission
costs
that
are
unrecoverable
or
that
the
Utility
has
not
sought
to
recover.

The Utility’s ability to recover its natural gas transmission and storage costs and earn its authorized ROE could be materially affected by the amount of revenues the
CPUC ultimately authorizes the Utility to collect in the 2015 GT&S rate case proceeding and future GT&S rate cases.  (See “R egulatory Matters ” in Item 7. MD&A.)  The
Utility continues to incur material unrecoverable costs to meet the Penalty Decision’s requirement to fund safety-related projects and programs to be identified by the CPUC in
the 2015 GT&S rate case.  Depending on how the CPUC designates pipeline safety-related projects and programs the Utility is required to fund, and how the Utility’s
associated costs are counted toward meeting the $850 million maximum disallowance imposed by the Penalty Decision , the ultimate amount of unrecoverable pipeline-related
costs the Utility incurs may be higher than current forecasts.  In addition, the Penalty Decision requires the Utility to implement various remedial measures which the CPUC
estimated would cost $50 million.  Actual costs to implement the remedies could be higher.

In addition, the Utility plans to incur unrecoverable costs to continue performing certain work to complete projects under the PSEP and to identify and remove

encroachments from gas transmission pipeline rights-of-way.  Actual costs to perform this work could exceed forecasts .

PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
results
primarily
depend
on
the
outcomes
of

regulatory
and
ratemaking
proceedings
and
the
Utility’s
ability
to

manage
its
operating
expenses
and
capital
expenditures
so
that
it
is
able
to
earn
its
authorized
rate
of
return
in
a
timely
manner.

As a regulated entity, the Utility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient
revenues to recover the costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially
affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE.   The outcome of
the Utility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the Utility’s reputation (especially if the Utility is convicted of the federal criminal charges
discussed above), the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative
environments; and the opinions of the Utility’s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and
afford able electric and gas services.

25

The Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-
wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs,
energy storage and renewable energy targets, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project.  The Utility’s ability to recover costs , including its investment s ,
associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the
associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas service s .

In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs to

safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs.  The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market
circumstances, unanticipated events (such as storms, accidents, catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies.
Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the
Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs.  Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently
incurred by the Utility.

The Utility’s ability to recover its costs also may be affected by the economy and its impact on the Utility’s customers.  For example, a sustained downturn or

sluggishness in the economy could reduce the Utility’s sales to industrial and commercial customers or the level of uncollectible bills could increase.  Although the Utility
generally recovers its costs through rates, regardless of sales volume, rate pressures increase when the costs are borne by a smaller sales base.

Changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE.   Although the

Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could
create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs.   To relieve some of this upward rate
pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.

PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
results
depend
upon
the
Utility’s
continuing
ability
to
recover
“pass-through”
costs,
including
electricity
and

natural
gas
procurement
costs,
from
customers

in
a
timely
manner.

The
CPUC
may
disallow
procurement
costs
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
In
addition,
the
Utility’s
ability
to
recover
these
costs
could
be
affected
by
the
loss
of
Utility
customers
and
decreased
new
customer
growth
,
if
the
CPUC
fails
to
adjust
the
Utility’s
rates
to
reflect
such
events.

The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricity
provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.   The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and
CPUC regulatory principles of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement
plan.  The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not
comply with its procurement plan.

Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of

reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due
to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers.   In particular, the Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to
meet the higher targets established by California SB 350 that became effective on January 1, 2016.  Despite the CPUC ’s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could
disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the costs are unreasonably above market.

The Utility’s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by the whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues
to function effectively.  Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which
the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.   The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher
costs of electricity to customers.  For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in California’s then-newly established wholesale electricity
market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimately causing the Utility to file a petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

26

Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth that occurs

through municipalization of the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who
become direct access customers of alternative generation providers.  (See “Competition in the Electric ity Industry” in Item 1.)  As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those
primarily residential customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would
have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs.  Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for generation-related costs
incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover the se costs.  In addition, the Utility’s ability to collect non-bypassable
charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups.  Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the
Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all.

In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering (“NEM”), which
allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers.   In January 2016, the CPUC
adopted new NEM rules and rates.   The new rules and rates are expected t o become effective for new NEM customers of the Utility later in 2016.   New NEM customers will be
required to pay an interconnection fee, will go on time of use rates, and will be required to pay some non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income,
energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.   However, the resulting rules will still put upward rate pressure on remaining customers, and remove the cap on
the number of NEM customers.   Significantly higher rates for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy
providers. The CPUC states that it intends to revisit these rules in 2019.

A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a

viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution
investments.  If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of capital investment would likely decline as well, in
turn leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings.  Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy
providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory
cost allocations, could adversely impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.

The CPUC has begun to implement rate reform to allow residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of providing service and decrease cost-

subsidization among customer classes.  Many aspects of rate reform are not yet finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose a fixed charge on
certain customers.  I f the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of
changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies , PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial results could be materially affected .

PG&E
Corporation’s

be
affected
by
their
ability
to
continue
accessing
the
capital
markets
and

financings.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to seek funds in the capital and credit markets to enable the Utility to make capital investments, pay fines that may be

imposed in the future, and incur costs to meet the Penalty Decision’s requirement to incur costs of up to $850 million for safety-related projects and programs to be identified by
the CPUC in the 2015 GT&S rate case.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financing
depend primarily on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings and outlook.   Their credit ratings and outlook can be affected by man y factors, including the outcome s
of the on-going criminal prosecution, the pending CPUC investigations, and ratemaking proceedings.  If PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s credit ratings were downgraded to
below investment grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing options,
including reduced , or lack of, access to the commercial paper market, additional collateral posting requirements, which in turn could affect liquidity and lead to an increased
financing need.  Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy
companies generally or PG&E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry, volatility in electricity or natural gas prices, an increase in
interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, and general economic and financial market conditions.

27

The reputations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to suffer from the negative publicity about matters discussed under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters”

in Item 7. MD&A.   The negative publicity and the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters may undermine investors’ confidence in management’s ability to execute its
business strategy and restore a constructive regulatory environment.  As a result, investors may be less willing to buy shares of PG&E Corporation common stock resulting in a
lower stock price.  Further, the market price of PG&E Corporation common stock could decline materially after the outcomes are determined.  The amount and timing of future
share issuances also could affect the stock price.

If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets, it could be required to decrease or suspend dividends to PG&E Corporation and PG&E Corporation could be

required to contribute capital to the Utility to enable the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.  To maintain PG&E Corporation’s dividend level in these circumstances, PG&E
Corporation would be further required to access the capital or credit markets.  PG&E Corporation may need to decrease or discontinue its common stock dividend if it is unable
to access the capital or credit markets on reasonable terms.

Corporation’s
ability
to
meet

and
other
financial
obligations
and
to
pay
dividends
on
its
common
stock
depends
on
the
Utility’s
earnings
and

cash
flows.

PG&E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own. The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its

obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it
can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation.  Under the CPUC’s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility’s dividend policy must be established by the Utility's
Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors give “first priority” to the Utility’s capital requirements,
as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner.  The CPUC has interpreted this
“first priority” obligation to include the requirement that PG&E Corporation “infuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.”
I n addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&E Corporation, the Utility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equity
component.

If the Utility were required to pay a material amount of fines or incur material unrecoverable costs due to a conviction in the on-going criminal prosecution, the pending

CPUC investigations , or other enforcement matters , it would require equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to restore its capital structure.  PG&E Corporation common
stock issuances used to fund such equity contributions could materially dilute EPS . (See “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in Item 7. MD&A.)  Further, if PG&E Corporation
were required to infuse the Utility with significant capital or if the Utility was unable to distribute cash to PG&E Corporation, or both, PG&E Corporation may be unable to pay
principal and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend , or meet other obligations.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to pay dividends also could be affected by financial covenants contained in their respective credit agreements that require

each company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ca pitalization of at most 65%.

event.

The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system .

(See “ Electric Utility Operations ” and “ Natural Gas Utility Operations ” in Item 1. Business.)  The Utility’s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to
efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably.  The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment
projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the
end of their useful operating lives.  The Utility’s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of
which are beyond the Utility’s control, including those that arise from:

·

the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions,
fires, or other catastrophic events;

f ailure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that result s in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas
surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life;

a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that result s  in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties;

the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environment al damage ,
or reputational damage;

the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act ;

the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built;

the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should
have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion) , and the failure to respond
effectively to a catastrophic event;
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to r espo nd effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or exte nded
outages;

severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, wild land and other fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events,
or other natural disasters;

operator or other human error;

an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudent ly;

construc tion performed by third parties that damage the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities , including, for example, ground excavations or “dig-ins” that
damage the Utility’s underground pipelines ;

the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water , or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities ; flaking lead paint from
the Utility's facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment;  and
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks , acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war .

The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output;
damage the Utility’s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause
personal injury or death.  As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties .  In
particula r, the Utility may incur material liability in connection with a wildfire (known as the “Butte fire”) that ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras c ounties i n
Northern California in September 2015 depending on the outcome of the investigations into the cause of the fire . If insurance recoveries are unavailable or insufficient to cover
such costs , PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected.  The Utility also could incur material fines, penalties
or disallowances , as a result of enforcement actions taken by the CPUC or other law enforcement agencies .

Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or

demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the
contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or
death caused by third-party contractor actions.  Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide
full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effect
on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility’s current insurance
coverage or may not be available at all.

The operation of the Utility’s extensive electricity and natural gas systems rel ies on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information technology systems

and network infrastructures that are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties.  The Utility’s business is highly dependent on its ability
to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of tasks and transactions . Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Utility’s technology systems are
vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.  The failure of the Utility’s operational and information technology systems
and networks could significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; damage the Utility’s assets or
operations or those of third parties; and subject the Utility to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial results.

The Utility’s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require ongoing maintenance, modification, and

updating, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction.   The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to maintain, modify, and update its systems and
these third-party vendors could cease to exist.  Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of
new systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention and resources, and could
negatively affect the Utility’s ability to maintain effective financial control s , and/or the Utility’s ability to timely file required regulatory reports.   The Utility also could be
subject to patent infringement claims arising from the use of third-party technology by the Utility or by a third-party vendor.

In addition, the Utility’s information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees.  The theft, damage, or improper
disclosure of confidential information can subject the Utility to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject the Utility to claims from third parties, reduce the value
of proprietary information, and harm the Utility’s reputation.

The
operation
and
decommissioning
of

The operation of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks
relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or
terrorist act.   If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.   In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear
incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.   (See Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.)

In addition, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel.   Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file

petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power .
Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete.   It is also possible that public pressure
could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation .  As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo
Canyon could cease before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025 .   In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its
unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s financial result s.

30

The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.   (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.
Business.)   If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.   The Utility may determine that
it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease
operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.   T he Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon before the
licenses expire in 2024 and 2025 .   At December 31, 2015, the Utility’s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $2.3 billion.

A t the state level, the California Water Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant

measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.   If the California Water Board requires the installation of
cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material
charge.   Even if the Utility is not required to install cooling towers, it could incur significant costs to comply with alternative compliances measures or to make payments to
support various environmental mitigation projects.

Further, the Utility’s leases of coastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge structures for the nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon expire in 2018 and
2019.  The Utility has requested that the California State Lands Commission renew the leases until 2024 and 2025 when the NRC licenses expire.  The C alifornia State Lands
Commission has deferred acting on the application until later in 2016.  It is uncertain what level of environmental review, if any, will be required before the leases can be
extended.  If the leases are not extended or if the Utility determines that it cannot comply with any new environmental conditions in a feasible and economic manner , then
operations at Diablo Canyon would cease and the Utility could incur a material charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment.

The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the

end of their useful lives.   (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item
8.)   The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from
customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.   If the Utility’s actual decommissioning costs, including
the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.

Risks
Related
to
Environmental
Factors

The
Utility’s
operations
are
subject
to
extensive
environmental
laws
and
changes
in
or
liabilities
under
these
laws
could
adversely
affect
PG&E
Corporation’s
and

the
Utility’s
financial
results.

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage,
remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife.  The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs
associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations.  The Utility has been in the past , and may be in the future , required to pay for
environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws.  Although the Utility has recorded
liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the
applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties.  (See Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
more information.)

Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more

expansive application of existing environmental regulations.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued
by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions.

The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms.  One of these mechanisms

allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or
change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates.

31

Some of the Utility’s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or
insurance .  (See “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1.) The Utility’s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate
the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  Their financial results also can
be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.

The
Utility’s
future
operations
may
be
affected
by
climate
change
that
may
have
a
material
impact
on
PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
condition,

results
of
operations,
and
cash
flows.

The Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns , rising sea levels) on the Utility’s

operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant.  Scientists project that climate change will
increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather.  Increasing temperatu res and changing levels of precipitation in the Utility’s service territory would
reduce snowpack in the Sierra Mountains.  If the levels of snowpack were reduced, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation would decrease and the Utility would need to acquire
additional generation from other sources at a greater cost.   If the Utility increase s its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to
meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits.  In addition, increasing temperatures and lower levels of
precipitation could increase the occurrence of wildfires in the Utility’s service territory causing damage to the Utility’s facilities or the facilities of third parties on which the
Utility relies to provide service , damage to third parties for loss of property, personal injury, or loss of life . In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the
Utility’s facilities, including hydroelectric assets such as dams and canals, and the electric transmission and distribution assets.  The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair
or replace facilities, restore service, compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered
through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase.

Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lower

revenues or increased expenses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected.

The Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation

of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility’s capital
investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits.  These permits,
authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays.  Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the
agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued.  In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a
license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility.  If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular
facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs.  Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing
agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility’s compliance costs.  In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility’s
hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced
electricity output and/or capacity at the facility.  In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other
approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain.

The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&E

Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits,
authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees.  The Utility also
maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets
and trust assets.  A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits
is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount
rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans.  Similarly, funding
requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or
decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and
equipment.  (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make
significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust
funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected .

The Utility’s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years.  Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to

recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel.  The majority of the Utility’s employees are
covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions.  Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements
with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members .  In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these
unions in the future.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational

harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings.  Any such occurrences could negatively impact PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition and results of operations.

ROPERTIES

The Utility owns or has obtained the right to occupy and/or use real property comprising the Utility's electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, natural gas

gathering facilities and generation facilities, and natural gas and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item 1. Business, under “Electric Utility Operations”
and “Natural Gas Utility Operations.”  The Utility occupies or uses real property that it does not own primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or
licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities.  In total, the Utility occupies 11.1 million square feet of real property, including 8.9 million square feet owned by
the Utility.  The Utility's corporate headquarters comprises approximately 1.7 million square feet located in several Utility-owned buildings in San Francisco, California.

PG&E Corporation also leases approximately 42,000 square feet of office space from a third party in San Francisco, California.  This lease will expire in 2022.

The Utility currently owns approximately 168,000 acres of land, including approximately 140,000 acres of watershed lands.  In 2002 the Utility agreed to implement its
“Land Conservation Commitment” (“LCC”) to permanently preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through conservation easements or equivalent
protections, as well as to make approximately 70,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified organizations.  The six “beneficial public values” being
preserved by the LCC include: natural habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation by the general public; sustainable forestry; agricultural uses; and
historic values.  The Utility’s goal is to implement all the transactions needed to implement the LCC by the end of 2018, subject to securing all required regulatory approvals.

Decision

CPUC’s
Investigative
Enforcement
Proceedings
Related
to
Natural
Gas
Transmission

On April 9, 2015, the CPUC approved final decisions in the three investigations that had been brought against the Utility relating to (1) the Utility’s safety record-

keeping for its natural gas transmission system, (2) the Utility’s operation of its natural gas transmission pipeline system in or near locations of higher population density, and (3)
the Utility’s pipeline installation, integrity management, record-keeping and other operational practices, and other events or courses of conduct, that could have led to or
contributed to the natural gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010 .  A decision was issued in each investigative proceeding to
determine the violations that the Utility committed.  The CPUC also approved a fourth decision (the “Penalty Decision”) which imposes penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6
billion comprised of: (1) a $300 million fine to be paid to the State General Fund, (2) a one-time $400 million bill credit to the Utility’s natural gas customers, (3) $850 million to
fund future pipeline safety projects and programs, and (4) remedial measures that the CPUC estimates will cost the Utility at least $50 million.  In August 2015, the Utility paid
the $300 million fine. At December 31, 2015, the Consolidated Balance Sheets include $400 million in current liabilities – other for the one-time bill credit that will be provided
to the Utility’s natural gas customers in 2016.  On January 14, 2016, the CPUC issued final decisions to close these investigative proceedings.

The Penalty Decision requires that at least $689 million of the $850 million disallowance be allocated to capital expenditures, and that the Utility be precluded from

including these capital costs in rate base.  The CPUC will determine which safety projects and programs will be funded by shareholders in the Utility’s pending 2015 GT&S rate
case.  If the $850 million is not exhausted by designated safety-related projects and programs in the 2015 GT&S proceeding, the CPUC will identify additional projects in future
proceedings to ensure that the full $850 million is spent. The CPUC is expected to issue a final decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case in 2016 to identify safety-related
projects and programs that will be subject to the disallowance. It is uncertain how much of the Utility’s costs to perform the safety-related projects and programs the CPUC will
identify as counting toward the $850 million shareholder-funded obligation. If the Utility’s actual costs exceed costs that the CPUC counts towards the $850 million maximum,
the Utility would record additional charges if such costs are not otherwise authorized by the CPUC.  As a result, the total shareholder-funded obligation could exceed $850
million.  For more information, see “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13: Contingencies and Commitments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 .

Federal
Criminal
Indictment

On July 29, 2014, a federal grand jury for the Northern District of California returned a 28-count superseding criminal indictment against the Utility in federal district
court that superseded the original indictment that was returned on April 1, 2014.  The superseding indictment charges 27 felony counts alleging that the Utility knowingly and
willfully violated minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act relating to record-keeping, pipeline integrity management, and identification of pipeline
threats.  The superseding indictment also includes one felony count charging that the Utility illegally obstructed the NTSB’s investigation into the cause of the San Bruno
accident.  On December 23, 2015, the court presiding over the federal criminal proceeding dismissed 15 of the Pipeline Safety Act counts, leaving 13   remaining counts.  The
maximum statutory fine for each felony count is $500,000 for total potential fines of $6.5 million.  On December 8, 2015, the court also issued an order granting, in part, the
Utility’s request to dismiss the government’s allegations seeking an alternative fine under the Alternative Fines Act.  ( The Alternative Fines Act states, in part: “If any person
derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not more than the greater of
twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss.” )  The court dismissed the government’s allegations regarding the amount of losses, but concluded that it required additional
information about how the government would prove its allegations about the amount of the gross gain prior to deciding whether to dismiss those allegations . ( Based on the
superseding indictment’s allegation that the Utility derived gross gains of approximately $281 million, the potential maximum alternative fine would be approximately $562
million. )   After considering the additional information submitted by the government, on February 2, 2016, the court issued an order holding that if the government’s allegations
about the Utility’s gross gains are considered, they would be considered in a second trial phase that would take place after the trial on the criminal charges. The trial on the
criminal charges currently is scheduled to begin March 22, 2016.

The Utility entered a plea of not guilty.     The Utility believes that criminal charges and the alternative fine allegations are not merited and that it did not knowingly and

willfully violate minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act or obstruct the NTSB’s investigation, as alleged in the superseding indictment.  PG&E
Corporation and the Utility have not accrued any charges for criminal fines in their Consolidated Financial Statements as such amounts are not considered to be probable.

Litigation
Related
to
the
San
Bruno
Accident
and
Natural
Gas
Spending

As of December 31, 2015, there were six purported derivative lawsuits seeking recovery on behalf of PG&E Corporation and the Utility for alleged breaches of

fiduciary duty by officers and directors, among other claims.

35

Four of the complaints were consolidated as the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
and are pending in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo.  On
August 28, 2015, the Superior Court overruled the demurrers filed by PG&E Corporation, the Utility and the individual director and officer defendants seeking to dismiss the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
, based upon the plaintiffs’ failure to demand action by the Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prior to filing the complaint.  After the
ruling, and pursuant to co-petitions for writ of mandate previously filed by PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the individual defendants, on September 3, 2015, the California
Court of Appeal issued an order staying the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
pending the court’s final determination whether to stay the matter altogether until the resolution of
federal criminal proceedings against the Utility.  On September 30, 2015, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the individual defendants filed an additional petition for writ of
mandate asking the Court of Appeal to review the lower court’s August 28 decision overruling their demurrers.  On October 22, 2015, the Court of Appeal issued a ruling
declining to review the August 28 decision.  On December 8, 2015, the Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate to the Superior Court, ordering the Superior Court to stay all
proceedings in the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
“pending conclusion of the federal criminal proceedings” against the Utility.  The other two derivative actions are entitled

these actions.  In the Tellardin
action, the defendants must answer or respond to the complaint 30 days after the stay in the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
is lifted.  In the Iron
Workers
action, the court has not established a deadline by which the defendants must an swer or respond.   Case management conferences have been scheduled in both actions
(March 21, 2016 in the Tellardin
action and June 3, 2016 in the Iron
Workers
action), after which PG&E Corporation will have more information about any further proceedings
in these actions.

Investigation
of
the
Butte
Fire

In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.  The California Department of

Forestry and Fire Protection (“Cal Fire”) is investigating the source of the Butte Fire to determine whether a tree contacted a power line operated by the Utility and was the cause
of the fire.  Cal Fire has reported that as a result of the fire there were two deaths and 965 structures, including 571 houses, were damaged or destroyed. Cal Fire’s investigation is
expected to conclude in 2016.

Approximately 27 complaints have been filed against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California in both the County of

Calaveras and the County of San Francisco, involving more than 600 individual plaintiffs and their insurance companies. Plaintiffs and the Utility filed petitions with the
California Judicial Council to coordinate these cases.  The petitions were assigned to the Calaveras Superior Court for a recommendation to the Judicial Council.  On January 21,
2016, the Calaveras Superior Court issued an order recommending to the Judicial Council that the cases be coordinated in the Superior Court of California, Sacramento County,
for all purposes including trial.  Among other factors, the Court found that coordination requires a court with a significant number of judges and complex litigation support
personnel, neither of which are present in Calaveras County.  For additional information, see “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13: Contingencies and Commitments
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Other
Enforcement
Matters

The Utility also could be required to pay fines, or incur other unrecoverable costs, associated with the CPUC’s pending investigations of the Utility’s natural gas

distribution facilities record-keeping practices and the Utility’s potential violations of the CPUC’s ex parte communication rules.  In addition, fines may be imposed, or other
regulatory or governmental enforcement action could be taken, with respect to the Utility’s self-reports of noncompliance with natural gas safety regulations, investigations that
were commenced after a pipeline explosion in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014, and other enforcement matters. See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13:
Contingencies and Commitments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Diablo
Canyon
Power
Plant

The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant employs a “once-through” cooling water system that is regulated under a Clean Water Act permit issued by the Central Coast

Board. This permit allows the Diablo Canyon power plant to discharge the cooling water at a temperature no more than 22 degrees above the temperature of the ambient
receiving water, and requires that the beneficial uses of the water be protected.     The beneficial uses of water in this region include industrial water supply, marine and wildlife
habitat, shellfish harvesting, and preservation of rare and endangered species.     In January   2000, the Central Coast Board issued a proposed draft cease and desist order
alleging that, although the temperature limit has never been exceeded, the Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant's discharge was not protective of beneficial uses.

36

In October   2000, the Utility and the Central Coast Board reached a tentative settlement under which the Central Coast Board agreed to find that the Utility's discharge

of cooling water from the Diablo Canyon power plant protects beneficial uses and that the intake technology reflects the best technology available, as defined in the federal Clean
Water Act.     As part of the tentative settlement, the Utility agreed to take measures to preserve certain acreage north of the plant and to fund approximately $6   million in
environmental projects and future environmental monitoring related to coastal resources.     On March   21, 2003, the Central Coast Board voted to accept the settlement
agreement.     On June   17, 2003, the settlement agreement was executed by the Utility, the Central Coast Board and the California Attorney General's Office.     A condition to
the effectiveness of the settlement agreement is that the Central Coast Board renew Diablo Canyon's permit.

At its July   10, 2003 meeting, the Central Coast Board did not renew the permit and continued the permit renewal hearing indefinitely.     Several Central Coast Board

members indicated that they no longer supported the settlement agreement, and the Central Coast Board requested a team of independent scientists, as part of a technical working
group, to develop additional information on possible mitigation measures for Central Coast Board staff.     In January   2005, the Central Coast Board published the scientists'
draft report recommending several such mitigation measures.     If the Central Coast Board adopts the scientists' recommendations, and if the Utility ultimately is required to
implement the projects proposed in the draft report, it could incur costs of up to approximately $30   million.     The Utility would seek to recover these costs through rates
charged to customers.

The final requirements of the federal and state cooling water policies (discussed above in Item 1. Business under “Environmental Regulation – Water Quality”) could

affect future negotiations between the Central Coast Board and the Utility regarding the status of the 2003 settlement agreement.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that
the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition or results of operations.

Venting
Incidents
in
San
Benito
County

As part of its regular maintenance and inspection practices for its natural gas transmission system, the Utility performs in-line inspections of pipelines using devices

called “pigs” that travel through the pipeline to inspect and clean the walls of the pipe.  When in-line inspections are performed, natural gas in the pipeline is released or vented at
the pipeline station where the device is removed.  In February 2014, the Utility conducted an in-line inspection of a natural gas transmission pipeline that traverses San Benito
County and vented the natural gas at the Utility’s transmission station located in Hollister, which is next to an elementary school.  The Utility vented the natural gas during
school hours on three occasions that month.  After being informed of the venting by the local air district, the San Benito County District Attorney notified the Utility in
December 2014 that it was contemplating bringing legal action against the Utility for violation of Health and Safety Code section 41700, which prohibits discharges of air
contaminants that cause a public nuisance.  The Utility has been in settlement discussions with the district attorney’s office since that time.  On October 28,   2015, the district
attorney informed the Utility that it would seek civil penalties in excess of $100,000 but is willing to continue to explore settlement options with the Utility.

PG&E Corporation made equity contributions to the Utility totaling $100 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  PG&E Corporation did not make any sales of
unregistered equity securities during 2015 in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  However, PG&E Corporation recently
discovered, based on a review of new accounts opened under its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRSPP") since 2013, that it issued and sold shares of
common stock under the optional cash purchase feature of its DRSPP more than three years after the related registration statement for the DRSPP became effective, including
approximately 19,550 shares for estimated aggregate sales proceeds of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.  As a result, participants who purchased these shares
may have a rescission right that would allow them to return the shares to PG&E Corporation in exchange for the purchase price paid by such participants, plus interest, less the
value of dividends received.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility operating in northern and central

California.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.

The Utility’s base revenue requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case and by the FERC in its TO rate cases based on forecast costs.
Differences between forecast costs and actual costs can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the cost of labor
and materials.     Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.     Generally, differences between actual costs and
forecast costs could affect the Utility’s ability to earn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Results of Operations below).
  However, for certain operating costs, such as costs associated with pension and other employee benefits, the Utility is authorized to track the difference between actual amounts
and forecast amounts and recover or refund the difference through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations
below).     The Utility also collects revenue requirements to recover certain costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers , such as the costs to procure
electricity or natural gas for its customers .     Therefore, although these costs can fluctuate, they generally do not impact net income (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs
that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below).     See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” in Item 1 for further discussion.

This is a combined report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities.  This combined

MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Summary
of
Changes
in
Net
Income
and
Earnings
per
Share

T he following table is a summary reconciliation of the key changes, after-tax, in PG&E Corporation’s income available for common shareholders and EPS (as well as

earnings from operations and EPS based on earnings from operations) for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 (see “Results of
Operations” below).   “ Earnings from operations ” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as income available for common shareholders less items impacting
comparability.   “ Items impacting comparability ” represent items that management does not consider part of the normal course of operations and affect comparability of
financial results between periods.   PG&E Corporation uses earnings from operations to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes
including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term operating plans, and employee incentive compensation .   PG&E Corporation believes that earnings from
operations provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance
.  E arnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for GAAP measures such as income av ailable for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures used by other companies.

(1)  In 2014, natural gas matters included pipeline-related costs to perform work under the PSEP and other activities associated with safety improvements to the Utility’s natural gas system, as well as legal

and other costs related to natural gas matters. Natural gas matter s also included charges related to fines, third party liability claims, and insurance recoveries in 2014.

( 2 )   In 2014, the Utility reduced its accrual related to the Hinkley whole house water replacement program.
(3)  “Earnings from operations” is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and excludes the items impacting comparability shown in n otes (1) and (2) above and Notes ( 7 ), ( 8 ), and ( 9 ) below.
( 4 ) Represents expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, with no corresponding increase in revenue.  The Utility has requested that the CPUC authorize an increase to the
Utility’s revenue requirements for 2015, 2016, and 2017 in its 2015 GT&S rate case , and exp ects a final decision in 2016 .  A ny revenue requirement increase that the CPUC may authorize would be
retroactive to January 1, 2015 but would be recorded in the period a final decision is issued .
( 5 ) Includes legal and other regulatory related costs that were partially offset by incentive revenues .
( 6 ) Represents the larger gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2015.
(7 ) Represents insurance recoveries of $49 million, pre-tax, for third party claims and associated legal costs related to the San Bruno accident the Utility received during the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Utility has received a cumulative total of $515 million through insurance related to $558 million of third-party claims and $92 million of legal costs incurred. No further insurance recoveries related to
thes e claims and costs are expected .

(8 ) Represents the impact of the Penalty Decision (see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. for before-tax amounts) .
( 9 ) In 2015, pipeline-related expenses include costs incurred to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights of way and to performremaining work under the Utility’s PSEP.  Legal and

regulatory related expenses include costs incurred in connection with various enforcement, regulatory, and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications.

Key
Factors
Affecting
Results
of
Operations,
Financial
Condition,
and
Cash
Flows

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that their future results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows will be materiall y affected by the following

factors:

· The
Outcome
of
Enforcement
and
Litigation
Matters.
  Future financial results will be impacted by the unrecoverable
pipeline safety-related and remedies costs required by the Penalty Decision. The Utility’s future results may also be
impacted by various other pending enforcement and regulatory actions, including the federal criminal charg es and CPUC
investigations of the Utility’s compliance with natural gas distribution record-keeping practices and potential violations of
the CPUC’s ex parte communication rules.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the N otes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .)

· T
he
Timing
and
Outcome
of
Regulatory
Matters
.  The 2015 GT&S rate case remains pending.  T he Utility requested that
the CPUC authorize a $532 million increase in annual revenue requirements for gas transmission and storage operations
beginning on January 1, 2015 with attrition increases in 2016 and 2017.  Any revenue requirement increase that the CPUC
may authorize would be retroactive to January 1, 2015 but would be recorded in the period a final decision is reached . (See
“ Regulatory Matters − 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” below for more information.)   In September 2015,
the Utility filed its 2017 GRC application to request that the CPUC authorize revenue requirements for the Utility’s electric
generation business and its electric and natural gas distribution business for 2017 through 2019.  (See “ Regulatory Matters
− 2017 General Rate Case” below for more information.)  In addition, the Utility has one transmission owner rate case
pending at the FERC (See “ Regulatory Matters – FERC TO Rate Cases” below . )   The outcome of regulatory proceedings
can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties, potential rate impacts, the Utility’s
reputation, the regulatory and political environments, and other facto rs .

· The
Ability
of
the
Utility
to
Control
Operating
Costs
and
Capital
Expenditures.
  Whether the Utility is able to earn its

authorized rate of return could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs differ from the amounts authorized in the
rate case decisions.   In addition to incurring shareholder-funded costs and costs associated with remedial measures required
by the Penalty Decision, t he Utility also forecasts that in 201 6 it will incur unrecovered pipeline-related expenses ranging
from $ 100 million to $150 million which primarily relate to costs to identify and remove encroachments from transmission
pipeline rights-of-way . The ultimate amount of unrecovered costs also could be affected by how the CPUC determines
which costs are included in determining whether the $850 million shareholder-funded obligation under the Penalty Decision
has been met, and the outcome of pending and future investigations and enforcement matters.  (See  “Enforcement and
Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .) The Utility’s ability to
recover costs in the future also could be affected by decreases in customer demand driven by legislative and regulatory
initiatives relating to distributed generation resources, renewable energy requirements, and changes in the electric rate
structure.

· The
Amount
and
Timing
of
the
Utility’s
Financing
Needs.

PG&E Corporation contributes equity to the Utility as needed to
maintain the Utility’s CPUC-au thorized capital structure.  In 201 5 , PG&E Corporation issued $ 801 million of common
stock with cash proceeds and made equity contributions to the Utility of $ 705 million.  PG&E Corporation forecasts that it
will issu e a material amount of equity in 2016 and future years to support the Utility’s capital expenditures .  PG&E
Corporation will issue additional equity to fund charges incurred by the Utility to comply with the Penalty Decision, to fund
unrecoverable pipeline-related expenses, and to pay fines and penalties that may be required by the final outcomes of
pending enforcement matters.   These additional issuances would have a material dilutive impact on PG&E Corporation’s
EPS.   PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital markets and the terms and rates of future financings
could be affected by the outcome of the matters discussed in “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 , Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , changes in their
respective credit ratings, general economic and market conditions, and other factors.

For more information about the factors and risks that could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows,

or that could cause future results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors .  In addition, this 201 5 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are
necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions that are based on current estimates, expectations, and
projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management's knowledge of facts as of the date of this report.  See the section entitled “Cautionary
Language Regarding Forward - Looking Statements” below for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility
are not able to predict all the factors that may affect future results.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not undertake an obligation to update forward-looking statements,
whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.

PG&E Corporation’s net income or loss consists primarily of interest expense on long-term debt, other income or loss from investments, and income taxes.  Results

include approximately $30 million and $45 million of realized gains and associated tax benefits related to an investment in SolarCity Corporation recognized in 2015 and 2014,
respectively.   PG&E Corporation’s operating results i n 2013 reflected an impairment loss of $29 million related to tax equity fund investments .

Utility

The table below shows certain items from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .  The table separately identifies the revenues and

costs that impacted earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (such as costs to
purchase electricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recover those pass-through costs,
do not impact earnings.  In addition, expenses that have been specifically authorized (such as the payment of pension costs) and the corresponding revenues the Utility is
authorized to collect to recover such costs, do not impact earnings.

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assets and
to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incurs to own and operate
its assets.

Utility
Revenues
and
Costs
that
Impacted
Earnings

The following discussion presents the Utility’s operating results for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for these

periods.

Operating
Revenues

The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues increased $ 393 million or 4% in 2015 compared to 2014 , primarily a result of approximately $490 million of

additional base revenues as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and by the FERC in the TO rate case.   This increase was partially offset by the absence of
approximately $110 million of revenues the CPUC authorized the Utility to collect for recovery of certain PSEP-related costs during the same period in 2014.

The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $ 890 million or 11% in 2014 compared to 2013 .  This amount include d an

increase to base revenues of $460 million as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision.   T he GRC decision also resulted in higher base revenues of $150 million in
2014 related primarily to the DOE settlement for sp ent nuclear fuel storage costs.   The total incr ease in operating revenues include d approximately $150 millio n of PSEP-
related revenues, and revenues authorized by the FERC in the TO rate case , as well as revenues authorized by the CPUC for recovery of nuclear decommissioning costs.  The
Utility also collected higher gas transmission revenues driven by increased demand for gas-fired generation.

47

Operating
and
Maintenance

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings in creased $ 1.2 b illion or 27% in 2015 compared to 2014 , primarily due to $ 907 million in

charges associated with the Penalty Decision , consisting of $400 million for the customer bill credit, an additional $100 million charge for the f ine payable to the state , and
$407 million of disallowed capital charges. ( See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 . )   The
increase is also due to higher labor and ben efit-related expenses of approximately $100 million and fewer insurance recoveries for third-party claims and associated legal costs
of $63 million related to the San Bruno accident .  No further insurance recoveries related to these claims are expected.   These increases were offset by $116 million in
disallowed capital recorded in 2014 related to the PSEP.

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased $127 millio n or 3% in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to lower third-party

claims and associated legal costs of $117 million resulting from the settlement of all outstanding third-party claims, lower disallowed capital expenditures of $80 million and
lower insurance recoveries for third-party claims and associated legal costs of $42 million related to the San Bruno accident . These decreases were offset by higher benefit-
related expenses and other operating expenses of $120 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 .

Depreciation,
Amortization,
and
Decommissioning

The Utility’s depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased $ 179 million or 7% in 2015 compared to 2014 and $ 355 million or 17% in 2014
compared to 2013 .  In 2015, the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions and higher depreciation rates as authorized by the FERC in the TO rate case .  In
2014, the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation rates as authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and higher nuclear decommissioning expense reflecting
the year-to-date increase as authorized by the CPUC in the nuclear decommissioning triennial proceeding.     Additionally, depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning
expenses were impacted by an increase in capital additions during 2014 as compared to 2013 .

Interest
Expense

The Utility’s interest expenses increased by $ 43 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the issuance of

additional long-term debt.  There were no material changes to interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.

Interest
Income
and
Other
Income,
Net

There were no material changes to interest income and other income, net for the periods presented.

Income
Tax
Provision

The Utility’s revenue requirements for the 2014 GRC decision period reflects flow-through ratemaking for income tax expense benefits attributable to the accelerated

recognition of repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s effective tax rates for 2015 are lower as
compared to 2014 and for 2014 as compared to 2013 and are expected to remain lower than the statutory rate in 2016 due to these temporary differences.

The Utility’s income tax provision dec reased $ 403 million or 105% in 2015 as compared to 2014 .  This is primarily the result of the statutory tax effect, $397 million,
of the lower i ncome b efore i ncome t axes in 2015 as compared to 2014 .   T he lower effective tax rate is the result of the tax benefits from property-related timing differences
applied to this lower income before income taxes.

T he Utility’s income tax provision inc reased $ 58 million or 18% in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher i ncome b efore i ncome t axes , partially offset

by certain reductions in tax expense for flow-through treatment as discussed above.

Fluctuations in revenues that did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs, see below for more detail.

Cost
of
Electricity

The Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its own
generation facilities, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on
price risk management activities.   (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

(1 ) C ost of purchased power was impacted primarily by a decline in the market price of natural gas in 2015 compared to 2014.
( 2) T he decrease in purchased power resulted from an increase in generation from the Utility’s own generation facilities.  Gas-fired and nuclear generation increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 as

compared to the same periods in 2014.

The Utility’s total purchased power is driven by customer demand, the availability of the Utility’s own generation facilities (including the Diablo Canyon nuclear

generation power plant and hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source of electricity .

Cost
of
Natural
Gas

The Utility’s cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage, transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and
realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.   (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s cost of natural gas is
impacted by the market price of natural gas, changes in the cost of storage and transportation, and changes in customer demand.

Operating
and
Maintenance
Expenses

The Utility’s operating expenses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred such as pension contributions and

public purpose programs costs.  If the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.  For 2015, 2014 , and 2013, no
material amounts were incurred above authorized amounts.

LIQUIDITY
AND
FINANCIAL
RESOURCES

Overview

The Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, and make distributions to PG&E Corporation depends on the levels of its operating cash flows and

access to the capital and credit markets. The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capital structure, the aggregate amount of long-term and short-term debt that the Utility may issue,
and the revenue requirements the Utility is able to collect related to its financing costs. The Utility generally utilizes equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-term
senior unsecured debt issuances to maintain its CPUC-authorized long-term capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock.  (See “Ratemaking
Mechanisms” in Item 1) .  The Utility relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs.

PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund equity contributions to the Utility , and pay dividends , primarily

depends on the level of cash distributions received from the Utility and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets. PG&E Corporation has material stand-alone
cash flows related to the issuance of equity and long-term debt, dividend payments, and borrowings and repayments under its revolving credit facility.  PG&E Corporation relies
on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending enforcement and litigation matters.  Credit rating
downgrades may increase the cost and availability of short-term borrowing, including commercial paper , the costs associated with credit facilities, and l ong-term debt costs.  In
addition, some of the Utility’s commodity contracts contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. If the
Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some of its net liability
positions .  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

PG&E Corporation’s equity contributions to the Utility are funded primarily through common stock issuances.  PG&E Corporatio n forecasts that it will issue between

$6 00 million and $800 million in common stock during 2016 , primarily to fund equity contributions to the Utility.  T he Utility’s future equity needs will continue to be affected
by charges incurred to comply with the Penalty Decision, by unrecoverable pipeline-related expenses, and by fines and penalties that may be imposed in connection with the
matters described in “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below . Common stock issuances by
PG&E Corporation to fund these needs would have a material dilutive impact on PG&E Corporation’s EPS .

50

Cash
and
Cash
Equivalents

PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds.  In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the

Utility holds restricted cash that primarily consists of cash held in escrow pending the resolution of the remaining disputed claims that were filed in the Utility’s reorganization
proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  (See “Resolution of Remaining Chapter 11 Disputed Claims” in Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility is uncertain when and how the remaining disputed claims will be resolved.

Financial
Resources

Debt
and
Equity
Financings

The Utility issued $1.15 billion in long-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2015.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item

8.)

In February 2015, PG&E Corporation entered into a new equity distribution agreement providing for the sale of PG&E Corporation common stock having an aggregate

gross sales price of up to $500 million.  During 2015, PG&E Corporation sold   1.4 million shares of common stock under this agreement for cash proceeds of $ 74 million, net
of commissions paid of $1 million.

In August 2015, PG&E Corporation sold 6.8 million shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering for cash proceeds of $352 million, net of fees.

In addition, d uring 2015, PG&E Corporation sold 7.9 million shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, and

share-based compensation plans for total cash proceeds of $ 354 million .

The proceeds from equity issuances were used for general corporate purposes, including the contribution of equity into the Utility .  For the year ended December 31,
2015 , PG&E Corporation made equity contributions to the Utility of $ 705 million, of which $300 million was used to pay a fine to the State General Fund as required by the
Penalty Decision.  Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to continue to issue long-term and short-term debt for general corporate purposes and to maintain the
CPUC-authorized capital structure during 2016.

Revolving
Credit
Facilities
and
Commercial
Paper
Programs

At December 31, 2015, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had $ 300 million and $ 1.9 billion available under their respective $ 300 million and $3.0 billion revolving

credit facilities.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

T he revolving credit facilities require that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of at most
65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter.  At December 31, 2015, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization was 51% and
50 % , respectively.  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit facility agreement also requires that PG&E Corporation own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the outstanding
common stock and at least 70% of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Utility.   In addition, the revolving credit facilities include usual and customary provisions regarding
events of default and covenants including covenants limiting liens to those permitted under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s senior note indentures, mergers, and imposing
conditions on the sale of all or substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s assets and other fundamental changes.   At December 31, 2015 , PG&E Corporation and
the Utility were in compl iance with all covenants under their respective revolving credit facilities.

Dividends

PG&E
Corporation

For each of the quarters in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , t he Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared common stock dividends o f $ 0.455 p er share, for annual

dividends of $ 1.82 per share.   Dividends paid to common stockholders by PG&E Corporation were $ 856 million in 2015 , $ 828 million in 2014 , and $ 782 million in 2013 .
In December 2015, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared quarterly dividends of $ 0.455 per share, totali ng $ 224 milli on, of which approximately $ 219 mil
lion was paid on January 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2015.

51

Utility

For each of the quarters in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the Utility’s Board of Directors declared common stock dividends in the aggregate amount of $ 179 million to

PG&E Corporation for annual dividends paid of $ 716 million in each of 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .  In addition, the Utility paid $ 14 million of dividends on preferred stock in
each of 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .  The Utility’s preferred stock is cumulative and any dividends in arrears must be paid before the Utility may pay any common stock dividends.
In December 2015, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock, payable o n February 15, 2016, to shar eholders of record
on January 29 , 2016.

The Utility’s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as
depreciation that do not require the use of cash.  During 2015 , net cash provided by operating activities increased by $ 101 million compared to 2014 .  This increase was
primarily due to higher base revenue collections authorized in the 2014 GRC and lower purchased power costs (see “Cost of Electricity” under “Results of Operations – Utility
Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” above), offset by the payment of a $300 million fine to the State General Fund as required by the Penalty Decision.   During
2014 , net cash provided by operating activities increased by $203 million compared to 2013 .  This increase was primarily due to tax refunds received during 2014 compared to
tax payments made during 2013 and additional collateral returned to the Utility in 2014 as compared to 2013, offset by higher purchased power costs (see “Cost of Electricity”
under “Results of Operations – Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” above) .

52

Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

the shareholder-funded bill credit of $400 million to natural gas customers in 2016, as required by the Penalty Decision (see “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note
13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements);

the timing and amounts of other fines or penalties that may be imposed in connection with the criminal prosecution of the Utility and the remaining investigations and
other enforcement matters (see “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below);

the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, including the 2015 GT&S rate case;

the timing and amount of costs the Utility incurs, but does not recover, associated with its natural gas system (including costs to implement remedial measures and $850
million to pay for designated pipeline safety projects and programs, as required by the Penalty Decision);

the timing and amount of tax payments (including the bonus depreciation extension) , tax refunds, net collateral paym ents, and interest payments;

the timing of the resolution of the Chapter 11 disputed claims and the amount of principal and interest on these claims that the Utility will be required to pay.

Investing
Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $ 412 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of $340 million in capital expenditures

and an increase in net purchases of nuclear decommissioning trust investments in 2015 as compared to net proceeds associated with sales of nuclear decommissioning trust
investments in 2014 .   Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $343 million during 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due a decrease of $374 million in capital
expenditures.  This decrease was primarily due to lower PSEP-related capital expenditures and the absence of additional investment in the Utility’s photovoltaic program.

Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur between

$5. 4 billion and $5. 6 billion i n 2016 .

Financing
Activities

During 2015 , net cash provided by financing activities increased by $ 325 million as compared to 2014 .  During 2014 , net cash provided by financing activities

decreased by $427 million as compared to 2013 .  Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash
provided by or used in operating activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date of existing
debt instruments.  The Utility generally utilizes long-term debt issuances and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure,
and relies on short-term debt to fund temporary financing needs.

instrument’s maturity.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

( 2) See “Purchase Commitments” and “Other Commitments” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
(3) See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements.  As these annual requirements

continue indefinitely into the future, the amount shown in the column entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utility’s pension and other benefit plans.

( 4) Based on historical performance, it is assumed for purposes of the table above that dividends are payable within a fixed period of five years.

The contractual commitments table above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions .  Due to the uncertainty surrounding tax audits,

PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot make reliable estimates of the amount s and period s of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to unrecognized tax benefits.
Matters relating to tax years that remain subject to examination are discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .

O
ff-Balance
Sheet
Arrangements

PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on

their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources , other than those
discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (the Utility’s commodity purchase agreements) in Item 8 .

ENFORCEMENT
AND
LITIGATION
MATTERS

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigation matters
described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 . The outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect
on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial results.

54

Department
of
Interior
Inquiry

In September 2015, the Utility was notified that the U.S.   Department of Interior (“DOI”) had initiated an inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or

debarred from entering into   federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs citing the allegations contained in the superseding criminal indictment (See Note
13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8) .   The Utility filed its initial response on November 2, 2015 , to demonstrate that it is a presently responsible contractor
under federal procurement regulations and that it believes suspension or debarment is not appropriate.   It is uncertain when or if further action will be taken.

Pending
Lawsuits
and
Claims

As of December 31, 2015, there were six purported derivative lawsuits seeking recovery on behalf of PG&E Corporation and the Utility for alleged breaches of

fiduciary duty by officers and directors, among other claims.

Four of the complaints were consolidated as the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
and are pending in the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo.  On
August 28, 2015, the Superior Court overruled the demurrers filed by PG&E Corporation, the Utility and the individual director and officer defendants seeking to dismiss the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
, based upon the plaintiffs’ failure to demand action by the Boards of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prior to filing the complaint.  After the
ruling, and pursuant to co-petitions for writ of mandate previously filed by PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the individual defendants, on September 3, 2015 the California
Court of Appeal issued an order staying the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
pending the court’s final determination whether to stay the matter altogether until the resolution of
federal criminal proceedings against the Utility.  On September 30, 2015, PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the individual defendants filed an additional petition for writ of
mandate asking the Court of Appeal to review the lower court’s August 28 decision overruling their demurrers.  On October 22, 2015, the Court of Appeal issued a ruling
declining to review the August 28 decision.  On December 8, 2015, the Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate to the Superior Court, ordering the Superior Court to stay all
proceedings in the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
“pending conclusion of the federal criminal proceedings” against the Utility.  The other two derivative actions are entitled
Tellardin
v.
PG&E
Corp.
et.
al.
, pending in the Superior Court of California, San Mateo County, and Iron
Workers
Mid-South
Pension
Fund
v.
Johns,
et.
al
., pending in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  PG&E Corporation, and the other defendants have not answered or otherwise responded to the complaints in
these actions .  In the Tellardin
action, the defendants must answer or respond to the complaint 30 days after the stay in the San
Bruno
Fire
Derivative
Cases
is lifted.  In the Iron
Workers
action, the court has not established a deadline by which the defendants must an swer or respond.  Case management conferences have been scheduled in both actions
(March 21, 2016 in the Tellardin
action and June 3, 2016 in the Iron
Workers
action), after which PG&E Corporation will have more information about any further proceedings
in these actions.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are uncertain when and how the above lawsuits will be resolved.

R
EGULATORY
MATTERS

The Utility is subject to substantial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC and other federal and state regulatory agencies.  The resolutions of these and other

proceedings may affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

55

2017
General
Rate
Case

On September 1, 2015, the Utility filed its 2017 GRC application with the CPUC. In the 2017 GRC, the Utility has requested that the CPUC determine the annual

amount of base revenues (or “revenue requirements”) that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs for
electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and electric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return. (The Utility’s
revenue requirements for other portions of its operations, such as electric transmission, natural gas transmission and storage services, and electricity and natural gas purchases,
are authorized in other regulatory proceedings ove rseen by the CPUC or the FERC.)  In its application, the Utility requested a revenue requirement increase of $457 million, as
compared to authorized base revenues for 2016, as shown in the following tables:

In its application, the Utility stated that over the 2017-2019 GRC period the Utility plans to make average annual capital investments of approximately $4 billion in

electric distribution, natural gas distribution and electric generation infrastructure, and to improve safety, reliability, and customer service. (These annual investments would be
incremental to the Utility’s capital expenditures for electric and natural gas transmission infrastructure.)   The Utility also requested that the CPUC establish a ratemaking
mechanism that would increase the Utility’s authorized revenues in 2018 and 2019, primarily to reflect increases in rate base due to capital investments in infrastructure and, to a
lesser extent, anticipated increases in wages and other expenses. The Utility estimates that this mechanism would result in increases in revenue of $489 million in 2018 and an
additional $390 million in 2019.

56

In October 2015, the Utility filed supplemental testimony to reduce its original revenue requirement request by approximately $17 million per year based on its forecast

that it will incur approximately $61 million for unrecoverable costs to implement the remedies ordered in the Penalty Decision.

On February 22, 2016 the Utility will file an update of its forecasted increase, primarily to reflect the impact of the recent five-year extension of the federal tax code

provisions regarding bonus depreciation.

According to the CPUC’s current procedural schedule, testimony from the ORA and other parties is due in April 2016, evidentiary hearings are to be held this summer,
followed by a proposed decision to be released in November 2016 and a final CPUC decision to be issued in December 2016.  The Utility has requested that the CPUC issue an
order directing that the authorized revenue requirement changes be effective January 1, 2017, even if the final decision is issued after that date.

2015
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Case

In the 2015 GT&S rate case, the Utility requested that the CPUC authorize a 2015 revenue requirement of $1.263 billion to recover anticipated costs of providing

natural gas transmission and storage services, an increase of $532 million over currently authorized amounts.   The Utility also requested attrition increases of $83 million in
2016 and $142 million in 2017.   The Utility requested that the CPUC authorize the Utility’s forecast of its 2015 weighted average rate base for its gas transmission and storage
business of $3.44 billion, which includes capital spending above authorized levels for the prior rate case period.

The ORA has recommended a 2015 revenue requirement of $1.044 billion, an increase of $329 million over authorized amounts.  TURN recommended that the Utility

not recover costs associated with hydrostatic testing for pipeline segments placed in service after January 1, 1956, as well as certain other work that TURN considers to be
remedial.     TURN also recommended the disallowance of about $200 million of capital expenditures incurred over the period 2011 through 2014 and recommended that about
$500 million of capital expenditures during this period be subject to a reasonableness review and an independent audit.     TURN states that the Utility’s cost recovery should not
begin until the CPUC issues a decision on the independent audit. On December 18, 2015, the ORA filed a motion in the 2015 GT&S rate case for an Order to Show Cause why
the Utility should not be sanctioned $163 million for intentional misrepresentations regarding its compliance with gas safety regulations regarding maximum allowable operating
pressure f or its gas transmission lines. On December 30 , 2015, the Utility filed a response to this motion stating that it does not believe there is merit to the allegations. ORA
filed a reply on January 11, 2016, reiterating its allegations.

The Utility also has proposed changes to the revenue sharing mechanism authorized in the last GT&S rate case (covering 2011-2014) that subjected a portion of the

Utility’s transportation and storage revenue requirement to market risk.     The Utility proposed full balancing account treatment that allows for recovery of the Utility’s
authorized transportation and storage revenue requirements (except for the revenue requirement associated with the Utility’s 25% interest in the Gill Ranch storage field).

Based on the scoping ruling and procedural schedule that was issued on June 11, 2015, the CPUC plans to issue an initial decision to authorize revenue requirements
followed by a second decision to reduce the authorized revenue requirements by the costs of designated safety-related projects and programs up to the $850 million maximum
cost disallowance imposed by the Penalty Decision. (See Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information about the CPUC’s Penalty Decision.)
In accordance with an earlier CPUC decision regarding the Utility’s violation of the CPUC’s ex parte communication rules made in the GT&S rate case, the first decision could
disallow the Utility from recovering up to a five-month portion of the revenue increase that may otherwise have been authorized. It is uncertain how much of the Utility’s costs to
perform the safety-related projects and programs the CPUC will identify as count ing toward the $850 million shareholder-funded obligation. If the Utility’s actual costs exceed
costs that the CPUC counts towards the $850 million maximum, the Utility would record additional charges if such costs are not otherwise authorized by the CPUC.
Additionally, the Utility may record additional charges if the CPUC does not authorize capital spending from the prior rate case period. The authorized revenue requirements in
the GT&S rate case would be retroactive to January 1, 2015. The ruling states that the case would be completed within 18 months of the date of the ru ling, or by December
2016.

FERC
TO
Rate
Cases

On September 30, 2015, the FERC approved a settlement that sets the Utility’s 2015 retail electric transmission revenue requirement at $1.201 billion, a $161 million

increase over the currently authorized revenue requirement of $1.040 billion.

57

On July 29, 2015, the Utility requested that the FERC approve a 2016 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.515 billion. The proposed amount reflects a

$314 million increase over the settled revenue requirement of $1.201 billion.  The Utility forecasts that it will make investments of $1.246 billion in 2016 in various capital
projects.  The Utility’s forecasted rate base for 2016 is $5.85 billion, compared to forecasted rate base of $5.12 billion in 2015.  The Utility has requested that the FERC approve
a 10.96% return on equity.  On September 30, 2015, the FERC accepted the proposed revenue requirement, subject to hearing and refund, and established March 1, 2016 as the
effective date for rate changes. Hearings are being held in abeyance pending settlement discussions among the parties.

CPUC
Investigation
of
the
Utility’s
Safety
Culture

On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prioritize

safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards. The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate the Utility’s and PG&E
Corporation’s organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record of operations, including its record of safety
incidents. The CPUC authorized the SED to engage a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation and the preparation of a report containing the SED’s assessment.

The CPUC stated that the initial phase of the proceeding was categorized as rate setting because it will consider issues both of fact and policy and because the Utility

and PG&E Corporation do not face the prospect of fines, penalties, or remedies in this phase. Upon completion of the consultant’s report, the assigned Commissioner will
determine the scope of and next actions in the proceeding. The timing scope and potential outcome of the investigation are uncertain.

Diablo
Canyon
Nuclear
Power
Plant

The NRC operating licenses for the two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon expire in 2024 and 2025.  In November 2009, the Utility filed an application with the

NRC to seek the renewal of the operating licenses, a process which can take several years.  After the March 2011 earthquake in Japan that damaged nuclear facilities, the NRC
granted the Utility’s request to delay processing its renewal application until certain advanced seismic studies of the fault zones in the region surrounding Diablo Canyon were
completed.  The seismic studies have been completed and in September 2014, the Utility submitted a report to the NRC and the CPUC’s Independent Peer Review Panel
(“IPRP”) that confirmed the seismic safety of the plant.  The IPRP is providing comments on the report and the Utility expects the IPRP to conclude their review and issue a final
report in 2016.  In addition, the Utility has requested that the California State Lands Commission extend the leases for the land occupied by Diablo Canyon’s water intake and
discharge structures from the current expiration dates in 2018 and 2019 to 2024 and 2025 when the NRC operating licenses are currently due to expire.  The California State
Lands Commission has deferred acting on the application until later in 2016.  It is uncertain whether the leases will be extended or whether an environmental review will be
required before the commission can issue a decision. Finally, the California Water Board is not expected to issue a final decision before January 1, 2017 to address how the
Utility’s nuclear operations at Diablo Canyon must comply with the state’s policy regarding once-through cooling.  The Utility’s Diablo Canyon operations must be in
compliance with the California Water Board’s policy by December 31, 2024.  Based on these and other factors, the Utility is continuing to assess its strategy for license renewal
of Diablo Canyon.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1.  For a discussion of the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning obligations, see Note 2:
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

LEGISLATIVE
AND
REGULATORY
INITIATIVES

The California Legislature and the CPUC have adopted requirements and policies to accommodate the growth in distributed electric generation resources (including

solar installations), increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to customers, foster the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage
the use of electric vehicles, and promote customer energy efficiency and demand response programs.   In addition, the CPUC continues to implement state law requirements to
reform electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of service, reduce cross-subsidization among customer rate classes, implement new rules and rates for net
energy metering (which currently allow certain self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate), and allow customers to have greater
control over their energy use.   CPUC proceedings related to some of these matters are discussed below.

58

In addition, prompted by a methane gas leak from a natural gas storage facility located in Southern California, the California Legislature has begun to consider adopting
new legislation to address natural gas storage operations in California, including increased oversight of natural gas storage facilities and the adoption of new safety and reliability
measures.  The California Governor also issued an emergency proclamation that requires various state agencies to take immediate action, as discussed below.

The Utility’s ability to recover its costs, including investments associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as its electricity procurement and other

operating costs, will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted
to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas service.

Natural
Gas
Storage
Facilities

On January 6, 2016 the California Governor order ed the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources ( “ DOGGR ” ) to issue emergency regulations to require gas

storage facility operators throughout California , including the Utility, to comply with new safety and reliability measures, including minimum daily inspection of gas storage
well heads (using gas leak detection technology such as infrared imaging), ongoing verification of the mechanical integrity of all gas storage wells, ongoing measurement of
annular gas pressure or annular gas flow within wells, regular testing of all safety valves used in wells, establishing minimum and maximum pressure limits for each gas storage
facility in the state, and establishing  a comprehensive risk management plan that evaluates and prepares for risks at each facility, including corrosion potential of pipes and
equipment.   The Utility may incur significant costs to comply with the new regulations but anticipates that it would be able to recover such costs through rates.

The DOGGR, the CPUC, the CARB, and the CEC will be required to submit to the California Governor's Office a report that assesses the long-term viability of natural

gas storage facilities in California.  The report will address operational safety and potential health risks, methane emissions, supply reliability for gas and electricity demand in
California, and the role of storage facilities and natural gas infrastructure in the State's long-term GHG emission reduction strategies.

New
Renewable
Energy
Targets

In October 2015, the California Governor signed SB 350 which, effective January 1, 2016, increases the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most

load-serving entities, including the Utility, to their customers from 33% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period to 50% of their total
annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030 compliance period and in each compliance period thereafter.  SB 350 includes increasing interim renewable energy targets for the
periods between 2020 and 2030 and continues to include compliance flexibility and waiver mechanisms, including increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy
procurement in one compliance period to future compliance periods.  The Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy
targets which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable from customers as “pass-through” costs.  The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the
higher targets.  The CPUC is required to open a new rulemaking proceeding to adopt regulations to implement the higher targets.

Electric
Distribution
Resources
Plan

As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, the Utility filed its proposed electric distribution resources plan for approval by the CPUC. The Utility’s plan identifies

optimal locations on its electric distribution system for deployment of distributed energy resources.  The Utility’s proposal is designed to allow energy technologies to be
interconnected with each other and integrated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.   The Utility envisions
a future electric grid, titled the Grid of Things™, that would allow customers to choose new advanced energy supply technologies and services to meet their needs consistent
with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.  The Utility’s 2017 GRC includes a request to recover some of the investment costs that it forecasts it will incur under its
proposed electric distribution resources plan.

59

Electric
Rate
Reform
and
Net
Energy
Metering
(“NEM”)

On July 3, 2015, the CPUC approved a final decision to authorize the California investor–owned utilities to gradually flatten their tiered residential electric rate

structures from four tiers to two tiers by January 1, 2019.   The decision approved increased minimum bill charges for residential customers and also allows the imposition of a
surcharge on customers with extremely high electricity use beginning in 2017.   The decision requires the Utility to file a proposal by January 1, 2018, to charge residential
electric customers based on time-of-use rates unless customers elect otherwise (known as “default time-of-use rates”).   The Utility also may propo se to impose a fixed charge
on residential electric c ustomers.   Under the CPUC’s decision, default time-of-use rates must be implemented before the CPUC will permit the imposition of a fixed charge in
electric rates .

In January 2016, the CPUC adopted new NEM rules and rates.   The new rules and rates are expected t o become effective for new NEM customers of the Utility later

in 2016.   New NEM customers will be required to pay an interconnection fee, will go on time of use rates, and will be required to pay non-bypassable charges to help fund some
of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.

Electric
Vehicle
(EV)
Infrastructure
Development

In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision adopting a policy to expand the California utilities’ role in developing an EV charging infrastructure to support
California’s climate goals.   On February 9, 2015, the Utility filed an application requesting that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposal to deploy, own, and maintain more than
25,000 EV charging stations and the associated infrastructure.   The Utility proposed to engage with third party EV equipment and service providers to operate and maintain the
charging stations.  The Utility requested that the CPUC approve forecasted capital expenditures of $551 million over the 5 year deployment period.

On September 4, 2015, the assigned CPUC Commissioner and the ALJ issued a scoping memo and procedural schedule that required the Utility to supplement its

application by submitting a more phased deployment approach that will be considered in a first phase of the proceeding.   On October 12, 2015, the Utility submitted
supplemental testimony presenting two separate proposals.  In its first proposal, the Utility has requested that the CPUC approve approximately $70 million in capital
expenditures to deploy and own 2,510 EV charging stations over approximately 2 years. In its second proposal, the Utility has requested that the CPUC approve approximately
$187 million in capital expenditures to deploy and own 7,530 EV charging stations over approximately 3 years. Under the CPUC’s schedule, a proposed decision for the first
phase of the proceeding is expected to be issued by June 2016. Further deployment of EV charging stations would be considered in a second phase of the proceeding depending
on the outcome of the first phase.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the
Utility’s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous wastes; the reporting
and reduction of CO 2 and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear
fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 .)

Natural
Gas
Compressor
Station
Sites

The Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas compressor

stations.   The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment. At December 31, 2015 , $ 140 million and $ 300 million was
accrued in the Consolidated Balances Sheets for estimated undiscounted remediation costs associated with the Hinkley site and the Topock site, respectively.  Costs associated
with the Hinkley site are not recovered through rates.  (See “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 .)

RISK
MANAGEMENT
ACTIVITIES

The Utility and PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownership of the Utility, are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest

rates, and counterparty credit.

The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce

commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non- speculative purposes ( i.e ., risk mitigation).  The Utility’s risk
management activities include the use of energy and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements, most of
which are accounted for as derivative instruments.  Some contracts are accounted for as leases.

60

Commodity
Price
Risk

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and nuclear

fuel necessary for electricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers.  As long as the Utility can conclude that it is probable that its reasonably incurred
wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices will not affect earnings . Such fluctuations,
however, may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers are also fully recoverable through a ratemaking mechanism.

The Utility’s current authorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected.   The

Utility recovers these costs through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts , resulting in price and volumetric risk. (See “ 2015 Gas
Transmission and Storage Rate Case” above . )

The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s value-at-risk was approximately $ 2 million and $1 million at December

31 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively .  During 2015 , t he Utility’s approximate high, low, and average values-at-risk were $ 2 million, $ 1 million and $ 2 million, respectively.
During 2014 , the value-at-risk amounts were $9 million, $1 million and $5 million, respectively .  ( See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
for further discussion of price risk management activities.)

Interest
Rate
Risk

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest

rates.  A t December 31 , 2015 and 2014 , if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt, and cash
investments , th e impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $ 11 million and $9 million, respectively, based on net variable rate debt and other interest rate-
sensitive instruments outstanding.   ( See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of interest rates .)

Energy
Procurement
Credit
Risk

The Utility conducts business with counterparties mainly in the energy industry, including the CAISO market, other California investor-owned electric utilities,

municipal utilities, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas production companies located in the United States
and Canada.  If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas, then the Utility may find it necessary to procure electricity or gas at
current market prices, which may be higher than the contract prices.

The Utility manages credit risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit ratings,

and other credit criteria as deemed appropriate.  Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.  The Utility executes many energy contracts under master commodity
enabling agreements that may require security (referred to as “Credit Collateral” in the table below).  Credit c ollateral may be in the form of cash or letters of credit.  The Utility
may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by the
Utility).  Credit c ollateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current net receivables and replacement cost exposure exceed contractually
specified limits.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of

assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The accounting policies described
below are considered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and material to the financial position and results
of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgments and estimates.  Actual results may differ substantially from
these estimates.  These policies and their key characteristics are outlined below.

Regulatory
Accounting

As a regulated entity, t he Utility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers. These

amounts would otherwise be recorded to expense or income under GAAP.  Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  At December 31, 2015 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatory balancing
accounts receivable) of $ 9.3 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current balancing accounts payable) of $ 7.7 billion .

Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings,
proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals.  For some of the Utility’s regulatory assets,
including utility retained generation , the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the CPUC . The Utility also records a regulatory
asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery of incurred costs is probable, such as the r egulatory assets
for pension benefits ; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt.  The CPUC has not denied the recovery of any material
costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented.  If the Utility determined that it is no longer probable th at regulatory assets would be
recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to rate regulation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that
determination was made.   I f regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due
to the differences in the timing of expense or revenue recognition.

In addition, regulatory accounting standards require recognition of a   loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes

and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regarding probability of recovery, as
described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expected to exceed the amount to be recovered.
The Utility records a provision based on its best estimate; to the extent there is a high degree of uncertainty in the Utility’s forecast, it will record a provision based on the lower
end of the range of possible losses.   The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included in third-party
contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors.   The Utility recorded
charges of $407 million in 2015 for estimated capital spending that is probable of disallowance related to the Penalty Decision.  Management will continue to evaluate and
estimate capital spending that may be probable of disallowance in future periods.  These estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final 2015 GT&S rate case decision
which is expected in 2016.  The Utility also recorded $ 116 million and $ 196 million in 201 4 and 201 3 , respectively, for PSEP capital costs that are expected to exceed the
amount to be recovered.   See “ Enforcement and Litigation Matters ” in Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated F inancial Statements in Item 8.  Management will continue to
periodically assess its safety-related capital costs and the related CPUC regulatory proceedings, and further charges could be required in future periods.

62

Loss
Contingencies

Environmental
Remediation
Liabilities

The Utility is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to pay for
environmental remediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party.  Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous substances at
various potential sites, including former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or
disposal of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.

The Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potential site
requiring remedial action.  (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperation with regulatory
agencies.  For example, the Utility has begun a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.)  Based on such notification, the Utility completes an assessment
of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred.  The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when site
assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses .  Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory
environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requires
significant judgment.  Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types of hazardous substances at a potential site, the range of technologies that
can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third
parties.

When possible, the Utility estimates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending on the

level of information available.  Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who are expected to
devote a significant amount of time directly to the remediation effort.  These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions, operations and
maintenance activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.  Remediation efforts for a particular site
generally extend over a period of several years.  During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, thereby possibly affecting
the cost of the remediation effort.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Utility ’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $ 969 million and $ 954 million, respectively.  The

Utility’s undiscounted future costs c ould increase to as much as $ 1.9 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other
potentially responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond regulatory requirements.
Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may vary significantly from actual costs, and
the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.

Legal
and
Regulatory
Matters

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims and

lawsuits.  In addition, penalties may be incur red for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a provision for
a loss contingency when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the
range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range , unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  T
he assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future
events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and
payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s policy is to exclude
anticipated legal costs from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred .   (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” and “Legal and Regulatory Contingencies” in
Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

63

Asset
Retirement
Obligations

PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value and

its settlement date can be made.  At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset.  The Utility recognize s a regulatory asset or liabilit y for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through the ratemaking process.
(See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

To estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant est imates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs, inflation

rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning.  The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk associated with the
decommissioning obligation.

At December 31, 2015 , the Utility’s recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was $ 3.6 billion .   Changes in these estimates and

assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets. For example, a premature shutdown of the nuclear facilities at Diablo Canyon would
increase the like lihood of an earlier start to decommissioning and cause an increase in the ARO.  I f the inflation adjustment or discount rate increased 25 basis points, the result
would be an immaterial impact to ARO.

Pension
and
Other
Postretirement
Benefit
Plans

PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees a s well as contributory postretirement health care

and medical plans for eligible r etirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees .   Adjustments
to the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the d ifferences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results .  These amounts are deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between pension benefit expense recognized in accordance with GAAP and amounts
recognized for ratem aking purposes are recorded as regulatory asset s or liabilit ies as amounts are probable of recovery from customers.   To the extent the other benefits are in
an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date.  The significant a ctuarial

assumptions used in determining pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health care cost trend rate
and the expected return on plan assets.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary .  While PG&E Corporation
and the Utility believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes or amendments, or significant changes in assumptions
may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit oblig ations and future plan expenses.

I n establishing health care cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider rec ent cost trends and projections from industry experts .  This evaluation
suggests that current rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near term.  In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the design of PG&E
Corporation’s plans, the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2015 is 7.2 % , gradually decreasing to the u ltimate trend rate of 4 % in 2024 and beyond .

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations of the
employee benefit trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Fixed - income returns were projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to a
long-term inflat ion rate.  Equity returns were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term rate of inflation.  For the Utility’s
defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.1 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.8 % .

The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 688 Aa-grade non-callable bonds

at December 31, 2015 .  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

These forward-looking statements relate to, among other matters, estimated costs, including penalties and fines, associated with various investigations and proceedings; forecasts
of pipeline-related expenses that the Utility will not recover through rates; forecasts of capital expenditures; estimates and assumptions used in critical accounting policies,
including those relating to regulatory assets and liabilities, environmental remediation, litigation, third-party claims, and other liabilities; and the level of future equity or debt
issuances.  These statements are also identified by words such as “assume,” “expect,” “intend,” “forecast,” “plan,” “project,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “anticipate,”
“may,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “potential” and similar expressions.  These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, the realization or
resolution of which may be outside of management’s control. Actual results could differ materially.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all the factors that
may affect future results.  Some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, or from
historical results, include, but are not limited to:

·

·

·

the timing and outcomes of the 2015 GT&S rate case, the 2017 GRC, the TO rate cases, and other ratemaking and

natural gas distribution record-keeping practices, the SED’s unresolved enforcement matters relating to the Utility’s
compliance with natural gas-related laws and regulations, and the other investigations that have been or may be commenced
relating to the Utility’s compliance with natural gas-related laws and regulations, and the ultimate amount of fines, penalties,
and remedial costs that the Utility may incur in connection with the outcomes;

the timing and outcome of the CPUC’s investigation of communications between the Utility and the CPUC that may have
violated the CPUC’s rules regarding ex parte communications or are otherwise alleged to be improper, whether additional
criminal or regulatory investigations or enforcement actions are commenced with respect to allegedly improper
communications, and whether such matters negatively affect the final decisions to be issued in the 2015 GT&S rate case or
other ratemaking proceedings;

· whether PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able to repair the harm to their reputations caused by the criminal prosecution
of the Utility, the state and federal investigations of natural gas incidents, matters relating to the indicted case, improper

·

·

·

·

·

compressor station site located near Hinkley, California;

the impact of new legislation or NRC regulations, recommendations, policies, decisions, or orders relating to the nuclear
industry, including operations, seismic design, security, safety, relicensing, the storage of spent nuclear fuel,
decommissioning, cooling water intake, or other issues; the impact of actions taken by state agencies,  including the
California State Water Resources Board and the California State Lands Commission, that may affect the Utility’s ability to
continue operating Diablo Canyon; and whether the Utility decides to resume its pursuit to renew the two Diablo Canyon
NRC operating licenses, and if so, whether the licenses are renewed;

the impact of droughts or other weather-related conditions or events, wildfires (such as the Butte fire), climate change,
natural disasters, acts of terrorism, war, or vandalism (including cyber-attacks), and other events, that can cause unplanned

or information technology and systems owned by the Utility, its customers, or third parties on which the Utility relies;
whether the Utility incurs liability to third parties for property damage or personal injury caused by such events; and whether
the Utility is subject to civil, criminal, or regulatory penalties in connection with such events;

how the CPUC and the CARB implement state environmental laws relating to GHG , renewable energy targets, energy
efficiency standards, distributed energy resources, electric vehicles, and similar matters, including whether the Utility is able
to continue recovering associated compliance costs, such as the cost of emission allowances and offsets under cap-and-trade
regulations, and whether the Utility is able to timely recover its associated investment costs;

· whether the Utility’s climate change adaptation strategies are successful;

·

·

the impact that reductions in customer demand for electricity and natural gas have on the Utility’s ability to make and
recover its investments through rates and earn its authorized return on equity, and whether the Utility’s business strategy to
address the impact of growing distributed and renewable generation resources and changing customer demand for natural
gas and electric services is successful;

meeting regulatory requirements; whether the Utility is able to protect its operating systems and networks from damage,
disruption, or failure caused by cyber-attacks, computer viruses, or other hazards; whether the Utility’s security measures are
sufficient to protect against unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of information contained in such systems and networks,
including confidential proprietary information and the personal information of customers; and whether the Utility can
continue to rely on third-party vendors and contractors that maintain and support some of the Utility’s information
technology and operating systems;

their holding companies, including how the CPUC interprets and enforces the financial and other conditions imposed on
PG&E Corporation when it became the Utility’s holding company, and whether the ultimate outcomes of the CPUC’s
pending investigations, the criminal prosecution, and other enforcement matters affect the Utility’s ability to make
distributions to PG&E Corporation, and, in turn, PG&E Corporation’s ability to pay dividends;

NOTE
1:
ORGANIZATION
AND
BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION

NOTES
TO
THE
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility operating in northern and central

California.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.  The Utility is primarily regulated by the CPUC and
the FERC.  In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.

This is a combined annual report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s c onsolidated f inancial s tatements include the accounts of PG&E

Corporation, the Utility, and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  The Utility’s c onsolidated f inancial s tatements include the accounts of the Utility and its wholly
owned and controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both
PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., the companies operate in
one segment).

The accompanying c onsolidated f inancial s tatements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form 10-K.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP require s the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilitie s. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities,
legal and regulatory contingencies, environmental remediation liabilities, ARO s, and pension and other postretirement benefit plans obligations.  Management believes that its
estimates and assumptions reflected in the c onsolidated f inancial s tatements are appropriate and reasonable.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

NOTE
2:
SUMMARY
OF
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Regulation
and
Regulated
Operations

The Utility follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorized by

the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of providing service.  T he Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenue requirements through rates
is generally independent, or “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated
ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities. The Utility capitalizes and records, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise be
charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized over the future periods in which the costs are
recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Utility records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  A
mounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers in the future are also recorded as regulatory liabilities.

The Utility also records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are

probable of recovery or refund.  In addition, t he Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customer billings or
authorized revenue meant to recover those costs , t o the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund . These differences have no impact on net income.  (S ee
“Revenue Recognition” below. )

Management continues to believe the use of regulatory accounting is applicable a nd that all regulatory assets and liabilitie s are recoverable or refundable.  To the

extent that portions of the Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation or other
reasons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.

Revenue
Recognition

The Utility recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered . The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy

delivered to customers but not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Rates charged to
customers are based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements.

The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility’s revenues in the Utility’s GRC and its GT&S rate cases, which generally occur every three years.   T he Utility’s ability to
recover r evenue requirements authorized by the CPUC in these rates cases is independent, or “decoupled” from the volume of the Utility’s sales of electricity and natural gas
services.   The U tility recognizes revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected
within 24 months.   Generally, revenue is recognized ratably over the year.

The CPUC also has authorized the Utility to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the Utility has been authorized to pass on to customers,
including costs to purchase electricity and natural gas; and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.   In general , the revenue
recognition criteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred.

The FERC authorizes the Utility’s revenue requirements in periodic (often annual) TO rate cases.   The Utility’s ability to recover revenue requirements authorized by

the FERC is dependent on the volume of the Utility’s electricity sales, and revenue is recognized only for amounts billed and unbilled.

C
ash
and
Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at fair

value.

84

Restricted
Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of the Utility’s cash held in escrow pending the resolution of the remaining disputed claims made by electricity suppliers in the

Utility’s proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  (See “ Resolution of Remaining Chapter 11 Disputed Claims” in Note 13 below .)

Allowance
for
Doubtful
Accounts
Receivable

PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts to record uncollectable customer accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value.

The allowance is determined based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables , current economic conditions, and assessment of
customer collectability.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at weighted- average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies .   Natural gas stored underground is

recorded to inventory when injected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribut ion to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.   Materials and supplies
are recorded to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed.

Emission
Allowances

The Utility purchases GHG emission allowances to satisfy its compliance obligations. Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets – other

and other noncurrent assets – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.

Property,
Plant,
and
Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value .  Historical costs include labor and materials,

construction overhead, and AFUDC.  (See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful lives and balances of its property, plant, and equipment were as follows:

(1) Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories.  Stored nuclear fuel inventory is stated at weighted- average cost.  Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as it is used based on the amount of energy output.  (See

Note 13 below.)

The Utility depreciates property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross
investment balance in a particular class of property.  This method approximates the straight line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property, plant, and equipment.
The Utility’s co mposite depreciation rates were 3.80 % in 2015 , 3.77 % in 2014 , and 3.51 % in 2013 .   The useful lives of the Utility’s property, plant, and equipment are
authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers.  Depreciation expense includes a component for the
original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value at retirement.  Upon retirement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of
salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of
property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.

85

AFUDC

AFUDC represents the estimated cost s of debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and is capitalized as
part of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placed in service.  AFUDC related
to the cost of debt is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.  The Utility recorded AFUDC related to debt
and equity, respectively, of $ 48 million and $ 107 million during 2015 , $ 45 million and $ 100 million during 2014 , and $ 47 million and $ 101 million during 2013 .

The Utility has not recorded a liability related to certain ARO’s for assets that are expe cted to operate in perpetuity.  As t he Utility cannot estimate a settlement date or

range of potential settlement dates for these assets , reasonable estimate s of fair value cannot be made. As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for retirement activities
associated with substations, photovoltaic facilities, and certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain communications equipment from
leased property; and restoration or land to the conditions under certain agreements.

Nuclear
Decommissioning
Obligation

Detailed studies of the cost to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are generally conducted every three years in conjunction with the Nuclear
Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding conducted by the CPUC.  The decommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristics for the
Utility's nuclear power plants.   Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory
requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment.

The Utility adjusts its nuclear decommissioning obligation to reflect changes in the estimated costs of decommissioning its nuclear power facilities and records this as

an adjustment to the ARO liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The total nuclear decommissioning obligation accrued was $ 2.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
The estimated undiscounted nuclear decommissioning cost for the Utility’s nuclear power plants was $ 3.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (or $ 6.1 billion in future
dollars). These estimates are based on the 2012 decommissioning cost studies, prepared in accordance with CPUC requirements.

86

Disallowance
of
Plant
Costs

PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not be

recoverable through rates charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  The Utility recorded charges of $407 million in 2015 for estimated
capital spending that is probable of disallowance related to the Penalty Decision and $116 million and $196 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively, for PSEP capital costs that
are expected to exceed the CPUC’s authorized levels or that are specifically disallowed.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 below).

Nuclear
Decommissioning
Trusts

The Utility’s nuclear generation facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the safe

removal of a nuclear generation facilit y from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the property
for unrestricted use.  The Utility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts until authorized for release by the CPUC .

The Utility classifies its investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trust s as “available-for-sale.”  Since the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust assets are

managed by external investment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses are considered other-than-
temporary impairments.  Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable or recoverable, respectively, from customers through rates. Therefore,
trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact on the Utility’s earnings or accumulated other
comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined by specific identification.

Variable
Interest
Entities

A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whose

equity investors lack any characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiary and is required
to consolidate the VIE.

Some of the counterparties to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that would generate
electricity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIE s at December 31, 2015, it assessed whether it absorbs any of
the VIE’s expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchase agreement , analyzed the variability in the VIE’s
gross margin , and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are most significant to the VIE’s performance, such as dispatch rights
and operating and maintenance activities. T he Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amount the Utility pays for delivered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not
have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are most significant to the economic performance of any of these VIEs .  Since the Utility was not the
primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2015 , it did not consolidate any of them .

(1) Represents the cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) recog nized in accordance with GAAP.
(2) In connection with the settlement agreement entered into among PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC in 2003 to resolve the Utility’s proceeding under Chapter 11, the CPUC authorized the Utility
to  recover  $1.2  billion  of  costs  related  to  the  Utility’s  retained  generation  assets.    The  individual  components  of  these  regulatory  assets  are  being  amortized  over  the  respective  lives  of  the  underlying
generation facilities, consistent with the period over which the related revenues are recognized.

(3) Represents the expected future recovery of the net book value of electromechanical meters that were replaced with SmartMeter™ devices. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining balance of $70 million is

included in current regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(4) Payments  into  the  pension  and  other  benefits  plans  are  based  on  annual  contribution  requirements.  As  these  annual  requirements  continue  indefinitely  into  the  future,  t he Utility expects to continuously

recover pension benefits.

In general, the Utility does not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do not accrue interest.  Accordingly, the Utility earns a return only on its regulatory

assets for retained generation, regulatory assets for electromechanical meters, and regulatory assets for unamortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt.

Regulatory
Liabilities

Current
Regulatory
Liabilities

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Utility had current regulatory liabilities of $676 million and $261 million, respectively.   At December 31, 2015 , the current

regulatory liabilities consisted primarily of a $400 million bill credit to the Utility’s natural gas customers resulting from the Penalty Decision.   (See Note 13 below.)   Current
regulatory liabilities are included within current liabilities-other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(1) Represents the cumulative differences between asset removal costs recorded and amounts collected in rates for expected asset removal costs.
(2) Represents the cumulative differences between ARO expenses and amounts collected in rates.  Decommissioning costs related to the Utility’s nuclear facilities are recovered through rates and are placed in
nuclear decommissioning trusts.  This regulatory liability also represents the deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses on the se nuclear decommissioning trust investments.  (See Note 10 below.)

(3) Represents amounts received from customers designated for public purpose program costs expected to be incurred beyond the next 12 months, primarily related to energy efficiency programs.

Regulatory
Balancing
Accounts

The Utility tracks (1) differences between the Utility’s authorized revenue requirement and customer billings, and (2) differences between incurred costs and customer

billings.  To the extent these differences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months, the Utility records a current regulatory balancing account receivable or
payable.     Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a period exceeding 12 months are recorded as other noncurrent assets – regulatory
assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences do not have an impact on net income .  Balancing
accounts will fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs are incurred and cu stomer revenues are collected.

Pollution
Control
Bonds

The California Pollution Control Financing Authority and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank have issued various series of fixed rate and

multi-modal tax-exempt pollution control bonds for the benefit of the Utility.  Substantially all of the net proceeds of the pollution control bonds were used to finance or
refinance pollution control and sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at the Geysers geothermal power plant or at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant .  In 1999,
the Utility sold all bond-financed facilities at the non-retired units of the Geysers geothermal power plant to Geysers Power Company, LLC pursuant to purchase and sale
agreements stating that Geysers Power Company, LLC will use the bond-financed facilities solely as pollution control facilities for so long as any tax-exempt pollution control
bonds issued to finance the Geysers project are outstanding .  Except for components that may have been abandoned in place or disposed of as scrap or that are permanently non-
operational, t he Utility has no knowledge that Geysers Power Company, LLC intends to cease using the bond-financed facilities solely as pollution control facilities.

Revolving
Credit
Facilities

On April 27, 2015, PG&E Corporation and the Utility amended and restated their respective $300 million and $3.0 billion revolving credit facilities . The amendments

and restatements extended the termination dates of the credit facilities from April 1, 2019 to April 27, 2020, reduced the amount of lender commitments to the letter of credit
sublimits from $100 million to $50 million for PG&E Corporation’s credit facility and from $1.0 billion to $500 m illion for the Utility’s credit facility, and reduced the
swingline commitment on the Utility’s credit facility from $300 million to $75 million .  PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's revolving credit facilities may be used for working
capital, the repayment of commercial paper, and other corporate purposes.  At PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s request and at the sole discretion of each lender, the
facilities may be extended for additional periods.

Borrowings under each amended and restated credit agreement (other than swing line loans) will bear interest based, at each borrower’s election, on (1) a London

Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin or (2) the base rate plus an applicable margin. The base rate will equal the higher of the following:   the
administrative agent’s announced base rate, 0.5% above the overnight federal funds rate, and the one-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin for
LIBOR loans will range between 0.9% and 1.475% under PG&E Corporation’s amended and restated credit agreement and between 0.8% and 1.275% under the Utility’s
amended and restated credit agreement.   The applicable margin for base rate loans will range between 0% and 0.475% under PG&E Corporation’s amended and restated credit
agreement and between 0% and 0.275% under the Utility’s amended and restated credit agreement.  In addition, the facility fee under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
amended and restated credit agreements will range between 0.1% and 0.275% and between 0.075% and 0.225%, respectively.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s revolving credit facilities include usual and customary provisions for revolving credit facilities of this type, including those

regarding events of default and covenants limiting liens to those permitted under their senior note indentures, mergers, sales of all or substantially all of their assets, and other
fundamental changes.  In addition, the respective revolving credit facilities require that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total
consolidated capitalization of at most 65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter . PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit facility agreement also requires that PG&E Corporation
own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the outstanding common stock and at least 70% of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Utility.

Utility increased the commercial paper program limit from $1.75 billion to $2.5 billion. PG&E Corporation and the Utility can issue commercial paper up to the maximum
amounts of $300 million and $2.5 billion, respectively. PG&E Corporation and the Utility treat the amount of outstanding commercial paper as a reduction to the amount
available under their respective revolving credit facilities.  The commercial paper may have maturities up to 365 days and ranks equally with PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness.  Commercial paper notes are sold at an interest rate dictated by the market at the time of issuance.   For 2015 , the
average yield on outstanding PG&E Corporation and Utility commercial paper was 0.38 % and 0.42 % , respectively .

gross sales price of up to $ 500 million.  During 2015 , PG&E Corporation sold   1.4 million shares under this agreement for cash proceeds of $ 74 million, net of commissions
paid of $ 1 million.

In August 2015 , PG&E Corporation sold 6.8 million shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering for cash proceeds of $352 million, net of fees .

In addition, during 2015 , PG&E Corporation sold 7.9 million shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, and

share-based compensation plans for total cash proceeds of $ 354 million .

Dividends

The Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility declare dividends quarterly.  Under the Utility’s Articles of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common

stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock have been paid.  For 201 5 , the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a
quarterly common stock dividend of $0.455 per share.

Under their respective credit agreements, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are each required to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated

capitalization of at most 65%.   In addition, the CPUC requires the Utility to maintain a capital structure composed of at least 52% equity on a weighted average over four years.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are in compliance with these restrictions. At December 31, 2015, the Utility had restricted net assets of $ 15.2 billion and was limited to $ 110
million of additional common stock dividends it could pay to PG&E Corporation.

Long-Term
Incentive
Plan

The PG&E Corporation LTIP permits various forms of share-based incentive awards, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units , performance shares, and

other share-based awards, to eligible employees of PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to receive certain
share-based awards . In May 2014, the 2006 LTIP was terminated and the 2014 LTIP became effective.  A maximum of 1 7 million shares o f PG&E Corporation common stock
(subject to certain adjustment s ) has been reserved for issuance under the 20 14 LTIP, of which 15,674,803 shares were available for future award s at December 31, 2015 .

The following table provides a summary of total share-based compensation expense recognized by PG&E Corporation for share-based incentive awards for 2015 , 2014

, and 2013 :

Restricted
Stock
Units

Prior to 2014, restricted stock units generally vest ed over four year s in 20% increments on the first business day of March in year one, two, and three, with the
remaining 40% vesting on the first business day of March in year four. R estricted stock units granted in 2014 and 2015 generally vest equally over three year s . Vested
restricted stock units are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock accompanied by cash payments to settle any dividend equivalents associated with the vested
restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generally recognized rateably over the vesting period based on grant-date fair value .  The weighted average grant-date fair value
for restricted stock units granted during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 was $ 53.30 , $ 43.76 , and $4 2.92 , respectively.  The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested during
2015 , 2014 , and 2013 was $ 57 million, $ 34 million, and $30 million, respectively.  The tax benefit from restricted stock units that vested during each period was not material.
As of December 31, 2015 , $ 45 mil lion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remai ning
weighted average period of 1.48 years.

Performance shares generally will vest three year s after the grant date. Upon vesting, performance shares are settled in shares of common stock based on PG&E
Corporation’s total shareholder return relative to a specified group of industry peer companies over a three-year performance period.  Dividend equivalents are paid in cash based
on the amount of common stock to which the recipients are entitled .

Compensation expense attributable to p erformance share is generally recognized rat e ably over the applicable three-year period based on the grant-date fair value

determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model.   The weighted average grant-date fair value for performance shares granted during 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 was $
68.27 , $ 51.81 , and $33.45 respective ly.  There was no tax benefit associated with performance shares during each of these periods .  As of December 31, 2015 , $ 36 million of
total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance shares was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.45 ye ar s .

PREFERRED
STOCK

PG&E Corporation has authorized 80 million shares of no par value preferred stock and 5 million shares of $ 100 par value preferred stock , which may be issued as

redeemable or nonredeemable preferred stock.  PG&E Corporation does not have any preferred stock outstanding .

The Utility has authorized 75 million shares of $ 25 par value preferred stock and 10 million shares of $ 100 par value preferred stock.  At December 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2014, the Utility’s preferred stock outstanding included $ 145 million of shares with interest rates between 5% and 6% designated as nonredeemable preferred
stock and $ 113 million of shares with interest rates between 4.36% and 5% that are redeemable between $ 25.75 and $ 27.25 per share.  The Utility’s preferred stock outstanding
are not subject to mandatory redemption.  All outstanding preferred stock has a $25 par value.

At December 31, 2015 , annual dividends on the Utility’s nonredeemable preferred stock ranged from $ 1.25 to $ 1.50 per share.  The Utility’s redeemable preferred
stock is subject to redemption at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends through the
redemption date.  At December 31, 2015 , annual dividends on redeemable preferred stock ranged from $ 1.09 to $ 1.25 per share.

98

Dividends on all Utility preferred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights.

Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends, as specified
for the class and series. T he Utility paid $ 14 million of dividends on preferred stock in each of 2015 , 2014, and 2013.

NOTE

EARNINGS
PER
SHARE

PG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calculated by dividing the income available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding.  PG&E Corporation applies the treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the calculation of diluted EPS.
The following is a reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s income available for common shareholders and weighted average common shares outstanding for calculating diluted
EPS for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 .

INCOME
TAXES

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The i ncome tax provision includes current and deferred income taxes

resulting from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciation expense.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities based on the merits of the position.  T he tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based on the largest amount of
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, t he difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in future
periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecognized tax benefit.

Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investment recovery

period.   The Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.

PG&E Corporation files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more.  PG&E

Corporation files a combined state income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement under which the Utility determines
its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis.

The component of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 31, 2015 for PG &E Corporation and the Utility was $

50 million .

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s unrecognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months due to the resolution of several matters, including

audits.   As of December 31, 2015, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $ 60 million within the next 12 months.

Interest income, interest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  For t he

years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014, and 201 3 , these amounts were immaterial.

101

IRS
settlements

PG&E Corporation participated in the Compliance Assurance Process in 2015, a real-time IRS audit intended to expedite resolution of tax matters.  The Compliance

Assurance Process audit culminates with a letter from the IRS indicating its acceptance of the return.

PG&E Corporation’s tax returns have been accepted through 2014 except for a few matters, the most significant of which relates to deductible repair costs.  In
December 2015, PG&E Corporation reached an agreement with the IRS on deductible repair costs for the 2011 tax year, subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation.
Deductible repair costs will continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for subsequent years.  The IRS is expected to issue guidance in 2016 that clarifies which repair costs
are deductible for the natural gas transmission and distribution businesses.  T ax years after 2004 remain subject to examination by the state of California.

PG&E Corporation believes it is more likely than not the tax benefits associated with the federal and California net operating loss es, charitable contributions and tax

credits can be realized within the carryforward periods, therefore no valuation allowance was recognized as of December 31, 201 5 for these tax attributes.   As of December 31,
2015 , PG&E Corporation had approximately $ 29 million of f ederal net operating loss carry forwards related to the tax benefit on employee stock plans that would be recorded
in additional paid-in capital when used.

NOTE

DERIVATIVES

Use
of
Derivative
Instruments

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities.  Procurement costs are recovered through customer

rates.  The Utility uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.  Derivatives include forward
contracts, swaps, futures, options, and CRRs.

Derivatives are pres ented in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangements for each counterparty.  The fair

value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offset exist.

Price risk management activities that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These instruments are not held

for speculative purposes and are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Utility expects to fully recover in rates all costs related to derivatives as long as the current
ratemaking mechanism remains in place and the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.  Therefore, all unrealized gains
and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the cost of electricity or the cost of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases to
regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.

102

The Utility elects the normal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives.  Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that are

expected to be used by the Utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commodity delivered.  These
items are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Eligible derivatives are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting.

( 1) Unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk-related derivative instruments are recorded to regulatory liabilities or assets, respectively, rather than being recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Income.

These amounts exclude the impact of cash collateral postings.

( 2) These amounts are fully passed through to customers in rates.  Accordingly, net income was not impacted by realized amounts on these instruments.

Cash inflows and outflows associated with derivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The majority of the Utility’s derivatives contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies.  At

December 31, 2015 , the Utility’s credit rating was investment grade.  If the Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be required to post
additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some of its net liability derivative positions.

T he additional cash collateral that the Utility would be required to post if the credit risk-related contingency features were triggered was as follows:

PG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their cash equivalents, trust assets, price risk management instruments , and other investments at fair value.  A three-tier fair

value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value :

Level

1
–
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level

2
–
Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

Level

3
–
Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.

The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

Valuation
Techniques

The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabi lities shown in the tables above.  I nvestments, primarily

consisting of equity securities , that are valued using a net asset value per share can be redeemed quarterly with notice not to exceed 90 days.  Equity investments valued at net
asset value per share utilize investment strategies aimed at matching the performance of indexed funds.  Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of
the end of the reporting period.   There were no material transfers between any levels for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .

106

Trust
Assets

N uclear decommissioning trust assets and other trust assets are composed primarily of equity securities and debt securities.  In general, investments held in the trusts

are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks.

Global e quity securities primarily include i nvestments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.  Equity
securities also include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges across multiple industry sectors in the U.S. and other regions of the
world . Investments in these funds are classified as Level 2 because price quotes are readily observable and available.

Debt securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including corporate debt

securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is determined by observable
market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker
quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.
The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation model, as applicable.

Price
Risk
Management
Instruments

Price risk management instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, swaps, options, and CRRs that are

traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.

Power purchase agreements, forwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded forwards and swaps that are valued using
observable market forward prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded forwards
and swaps , or are valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued using
observable market data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2.

Long-dated power purchase agreements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued using either
estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond a period for which
market data is available.   Market and credit risk ma nagement utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3 instruments using pricing inputs
from br okers and historical data.

The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISO

auction and between auction dates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices . CRRs are classified as Level 3.

Level
3
Measurements
and
Sensitivity
Analysis

The Utility’s market and credit risk m anagement function, which reports to the Chief Risk and Audit Officer of the Utility, is responsible for determining the fair value

of the Utility’s price risk manag ement derivatives.  The Utility’s finance and risk management functions collaborate to determine the appropriate fair value methodologies and
classification for each derivative.  Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determine
reasonableness.

Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related to Level 3

instruments are expected to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value of these instruments.   (See
Note 9 above.)

Financial
Instruments

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value for financial instruments:

The fair values of cash , restricted cash , net accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, customer deposits, floating rate senior notes, and the
Utility’s variable rate pollution control bond loan agreement s approximate their carrying values at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , as they are short-term in nature or
have interest rates that reset daily .

The fair values of the Utility’s fixed - rate senior notes and fixed - rate pollution control bond s and PG&E Corporation’s fixed - rate senior notes were based on quoted
market prices at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .

The carrying amount and fair value of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s debt instruments were as follows (the table below excludes financial instruments with

(“PBOP”)

PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees hired before December 31, 2012 and a cash balance
plan for those eligible employees hired after this date or who made a one-time election to participate (“Pension Plan”).  T he trusts underlying certain of these plans are qualified
trusts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.   If certain conditions are met, PG&E Corporation and the Utility can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts,
subject to certain limitations.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy is to contribute tax-deductible amounts, consistent with applicable regulatory decisions and
federal minimum funding requirements.  Based upon current assumptions and available information, the Utility ’s minimum funding requirements related to its pension plans is
zero .

PG&E Corporation and the Utility also sponsor contributory postretirement medical plans for retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement

life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a fiscal year-end measurement date for all plans.

Components
of
Accumulated

Comprehensive
Income

PG&E Corporation and the Utility record unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses related to pension and post-retirement benefits other than
pension as components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax .  In addition, regulatory adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and
Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the difference between expense or income calculated in accordance with GAAP for accounting purposes and expense or income for
ratemaking purposes, which is based on authorized plan contributions.   For pension benefits, a regulatory asset or liability is recorded for amounts that would otherwise be
recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.   For post-retirement benefits other than pension, the Utility generally records a regulatory liability for amounts that would
otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.   As the Utility is unable to record a regulatory asset for these other benefits, the charge remains in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The estimated amounts that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost s for PG&E Corporation in 2016 are as follows:

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by determining projected stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations of

the employee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based on real maturity
and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were estimated based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a
long-term inflation rate .  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 6.1 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.8 %.  The rate used to discount pension benefits and other
benefit s was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 688 Aa-grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2015 .  This yield curve has discount
rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension benefits and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding
rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

Investment
Policies
and
Strategies

The financial position of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations.

Volatility in funde d status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial reporting , as well as the amount of
minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended .  P G&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investment policies and
strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of funded status volatility.

The trusts ’ asset allocations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings .   Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants of

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest rate changes also influence
liability valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility , PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trust s hold significant allocations in long
maturity fixed-income investments . A lthough they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce long-term funding costs due to their higher
expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust ’s holdings in equity and fixed-income investments by exhibiting returns with low
correlation to the direction of these markets. R eal assets include commodities futures, REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return
investments include hedge fund portfolios .

T arget allocations for equity investments have generally declined in favor of longer-maturity fixed-income investments and real assets as a means of dampening f uture

funded status volatility.  Derivative instruments such as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure.  In addition, derivative instruments such as equity index
futures and U.S. treasury futures are used to rebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio.  Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used to hedge
a portion of the non U.S. dollar exposure of global equity investments .

The target asset allocation percentages for major categories of trust assets for pension and other benefit plans are as follows:

PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guiding

principles of this risk management framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountability and
documentation.  Trust investment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversification, manage risk through appropriate use
of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.

In addition to the total plan assets disclosed at fair value in the table above, the trusts had other net assets of $ 13 million and $24 million at December 31, 2015 and

2014 , respectively, comprised primarily of cash, accounts receivable, deferred taxes, and accounts payable.

Valuation
Techniques

The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.   All investments that are valued

using a net asset value per share can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.

Short-Term
Investments

Short-term investments consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1 and

Level 2 assets.

Global
Equity

The global equity category include s investments in common stock , equity-index futures, and commingled funds comprised of equity securities spread across multiple

industries and regions of the world.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on public exchanges and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity
investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active mar kets for identical securities.  Equity-index futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active
markets and are Level 1 assets .  Commingled equity funds are valued using a net asset value per share and are maintained by investment companies for large institutional
investors and are not publicly traded.  Commingled equity funds are comprised primarily of underlying equity securities that are publicly traded on exchanges, and price quotes
for the assets held by these funds are readily observable and available.  Commingled equity funds are categorized as Level 1 and Level 2 assets.

Absolute
Return

The absolute return category includes portfolios of hedge funds that are valued using a net asset value per share based on a variety of proprietary and non-proprietary

valuation methods, including unadjusted prices for publicly-traded securities in active markets.  Hedge funds are considered Level 3 assets.

Real
Assets

The real asset category includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  The commodity

futures, global REITS, and global listed infrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  Private real estate funds are
valued using a net asset value per share derived using appraisals, pricing models , and valuation inputs that are unobservable and are considered Level 3 assets.

Fixed-Income

The fixed-income category includes U.S. government securities, corporate securities, and other fixed-income securities.

U.S. government fixed-income primarily consists of U.S. Treasury notes and U.S. government bonds that are valued based on quoted market prices or evaluated pricing

data for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  These securities are categorized as Level 1 or Level 2 assets.

Corporate fixed-income primarily includes investment grade bonds of U.S. issuers across multiple industries that are valued based on a compilation of primarily

observable information or broker quotes in non-active markets.  The fair value of corporate bonds is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations
(where observable), bond spreads or credit default swap spreads obtained from independent external parties such as vendors and brokers adjusted for any basis difference
between cash and derivative instruments.  These securities are classified as Level 2 assets.  Corporate fixed-income also includes commingled funds that are valued using a net
asset value per share and are comprised of corporate debt instruments .  Commingled funds are considered Level 2 assets.  Corporate fixed-income also includes privately placed
debt portfolios which are valued using a net asset value per share using pricing models and valuation inputs that are unobservable and are considered Level 3 assets.

Other fixed-income primarily includes pass-through and asset-backed securities.  Pass-through securities are valued based on observable market inputs and are Level 2
assets.  Asset-backed securities are primarily valued based on broker quotes and are considered Level 2 assets.  Other fixed-income also includes municipal bonds and Treasury
futures.  Municipal bonds are valued based on a compilation of primarily observable information or broker quotes in non-active markets and are considered Level 2 assets.
Futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.

Communication
Rules

During 2014 and 2015, the Utility filed several reports to notify the CPUC of communications that the Utility believes may have constituted or described ex parte
communications that either should not have been made or that should have been timely reported to the CPUC. Ex parte communications include communications between a
decision maker or a Commissioner’s advisor and interested persons concerning substantive issues in certain formal proceedings. Certain communications are prohibited and
others are permissible with proper noticing and reporting.

On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Utility should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule 1.1 of

the CPUC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure governing the conduct of those appearing before the CPUC.  The OII cites some of the communications the Utility reported to the
CPUC.  The OII also cites the ex parte violations alleged in the City of San Bruno’s July 2014 motion, which it filed in the CPUC investigations related to the Utility’s natural
gas transmission pipeline operations and practices.  A prehearing conference in the OII has been scheduled for March 1, 2016.

The CPUC will determine any penalties that might be imposed on the Utility and determine whether shareholders or ratepayers will bear the costs of the investigation.

The CPUC can impose fines up to $50,000 for each violation, per day. The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of the
circumstances, including such factors as how many days each violation continued; the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of
persons affected; and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC is also required to consider the
appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.  The CPUC has historically exercised this discretion in determining penalties.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that the CPUC will impose penalties on the Utility in the OII but they are unable to reasonably estimate the
amount or range of future charges that could be incurred , because i t is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, and
whether the CPUC will consider additional communications in the OII, including those identified in a motion filed on December 1, 2015, by the City of San Bruno in the 2015
GT&S rate case .  It is also uncertain whether the CPUC will take additional action in any of the proceedings in which the Utility has self-reported communications that may
have violated the CPUC’s ex parte rules .

Finally, t he U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General’s office also have been inv estigating matters related to allegedly improper

communications between the Utility and CPUC personnel .   The Utility is cooperating with the federal and state investigators.   It is uncertain whether any charges will be
brought against the Utility .

CPUC
Investigation
Regarding
Natural
Gas
Distribution
Facilities

Record-Keeping

On November 20, 2014, the CPUC began an investigation into whether the Utility violated applicable laws pertaining to record-keeping practices with respect to
maintaining safe operation of its natural gas distribution service and facilities.  The order also requires the Utility to show cause why (1) the CPUC should not find that the Utility
violated provisions of the California Public Utilities Code, CPUC general orders or decisions, other rules, or requirements, and/or engaged in unreasonable and/or imprudent
practices related to these matters, and (2) the CPUC should not impose penalties, and/or any other forms of relief, if any violations are found.  In particular, the order cites the
SED’s investigative reports alleging that the Utility violated rules regarding safety record-keeping in connection with six natural gas distribution incidents, including the natural
gas explosion that occurred in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014, for which the CPUC has previously imposed a penalty of $10.85 million.

On September 30, 2015, the SED submitted its supplemental testimony, which included incidents allegedly related to record-keeping that had not been identified in the

initial order, and also asserted violations related to the Utility’s pre-excavation location and marking practices, causal evaluation practices, and compliance with regulations
governing pressure validation for certain distribution facilities.  Evidentiary hearings were held during January 2016.  Opening briefs are due by February 26, 2016 and reply
briefs are due by March 31, 2016.  The SED has indicated it will seek significant penalties, the amount of which is expected to be disclosed in its brief.

119

P G&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that the CPUC will impose penalties on the Utility in the form of fines or other remedies, including possible
future unrecoverable costs to implement operational remedies. The Utility is unable to determine the form or amount of penalties or reasonably estimate the amount or range of
future charges that could be incurred given the CPUC’s wide discretion (discussed above) .

Natural
Gas
Transmission
Pipeline
Rights-of-Way

In 2012, the Utility notified the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address a self-

reported violation whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipeline rights-of-way.
The Utility also submitted a proposed compliance plan that set forth the scope and timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachments over a multi-year period and to
pay penalties if the proposed milestones were not met.   In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey has been completed and that remediation work, including
removal of the encroachments, is expected to continue for several years. The SED has not addressed the Utility’s proposed compliance plan, and it is reasonably possible that the
SED will impose fines on the Utility or take other enforcement action in the future based on the Utility’s failure to continuously survey its system and remove encroachments.
The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given the SED’s wide discretion and the number of factors that can be
considered in determining penalties.

Potential
Safety
Citations

    The SED periodically audits utility operating practices and conducts investigations of potential violations of laws and regulations applicable to the safety of the
California utilities’ electric and natural gas facilities and operations.   In addition, the California utilities are required to inform the SED of self-identified or self-corrected
violations. The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issue citations and impose fines for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports.   T he SED
can consider the discretionary factors discussed above (see “ Order Instituting an Investigation into Compliance with Ex parte Communication Rules ” above) in determining the
number of violations and whether to impose daily fines for continuing violations. The SED is required, however, to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000 for each
separate violation .

The SED has imposed fines on the Utility ranging from $50,000 to $16.8 million for violations of electric and natural gas laws and regulations.   The Utility believes it

is probable that the SED will impose fines or take other enforcement action based on some of the Utility’s self-reported non-compliance with laws and regulations or based on
allegations of non-compliance with such laws and regulations that are contained in some of the SED’s audits. The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of
future charges that could be incurred for fines imposed by the SED with respect to these matters given the wide discretion the SED has in determining whether to bring
enforcement action and the number of factors that can be considered in determining the amount of fines.

Federal
Matters

Federal
Criminal
Indictment

On July 29, 2014, a federal grand jury for the Northern District of California returned a 28-count superseding criminal indictment against the Utility in federal district
court that superseded the original indictment that was returned on April 1, 2014.  The superseding indictment charges 27 felony counts alleging that the Utility knowingly and
willfully violated minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act relating to record-keeping, pipeline integrity management, and identification of pipeline
threats.  The superseding indictment also includes one felony count charging that the Utility illegally obstructed the NTSB’s investigation into the cause of the San Bruno
accident.  On December 23, 2015, the court presiding over the federal criminal pro ceeding dismissed 15 of the Pipeline Safety Act counts, leaving 13   remaining counts.  The
maximum statutory fine for each felony count is $500,000, for total potential fines of $6.5 million. On December 8, 2015, the court also issued an order granting, in part, the
Utility’s request to dismiss the government’s allegations seeking an alternative fine under the Alternative Fines Act . The Alternative Fines Act states, in part: “If any person
derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not more than the greater of
twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss.”   The court dismissed the government’s allegations regarding the amount of losses, but concluded that it required additional
information about how the government would prove its allegations about the amount of gross gains prior to deciding whether to dismiss those allegations.  (Based on the
superseding indictment’s allegation that the Utility derived gross gains of approximately $281 million, the potential maximum alternative fine would be approximately $562
million.)   After considering the additional information submitted by the government, on February 2, 2016, the court issued an order holding that if the government’s allegations
about the Utility’s gross gains are considered, they would be considered in a second trial phase that would take place after th e trial on the criminal charges.   The trial on the
criminal charges currently is scheduled to begin March 22 , 2016.

120

The Utility entered a plea of not guilty.     The Utility believes that criminal charges and the alternative fine allegations are not merited and that it did not knowingly and

willfully violate minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act or obstruct the NTSB’s investigation, as alleged in the superseding indictment.  PG&E
Corporation and the Utility have not accrued any charges for criminal fines in their Consolidated Financial Statements as such amounts are not considered to be probable.

Other
Federal
Matters

The Utility was informed that the U.S. Attorney’s Office was   investigating a natural gas explosion that occurred in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014.   The U.S.

Attorney’s Office in San Francisco also continues to investigate matters relating to the indicted case discussed above.   It is uncertain whether any additional charges will be
brought against the Utility.

On Ap ril 9, 2015, the CPUC approved final decisions in the three investigations that had been brought against the Utility relating to (1) the Utility’s safety record -

keeping for its natural gas transmission system, (2) the Utility’s operation of its natural gas transmission pipeline system in or near locations of higher population density, and (3)
the Utility’s pipeline installation, integrity management, record - keeping and other operational practices, and other events or courses of conduct, that could have led to or
contributed to the natural gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010.  A decision was issued in each investigative proceeding to
determine the violations that the Utility committed.  The CPUC also approved a fourth decision (the “Penalty Decision”) which imposes penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6
billion c omprised of: (1) a $300 million fine to be paid to the State General Fund, (2) a one-time $400 million bill credit to the Utility’s natural gas customers, (3) $850 million
to fund future pipeline safety projects and programs, and (4) remedial measures that the CPUC estimates will cost the Utility at least $50 million. In August 2015, the Utility paid
the $300 million fine. At December 31, 2015, the Consolidated Balance Sheets include $400 million in current regulatory liabilities for the one-time bill credit that will be
provided to the Utility’s natural gas customers in 2016.  On January 14, 2016, the CPUC issued final decisions to close these investigative proceedings.

The Penalty Decision requires that at least $689 million of the $850 million disallowance be allocated to capital expenditures, and that the Utility be precluded from

including these capital costs in rate base.  The CPUC will determine which safety projects and programs will be funded by shareholders in the Utility’s pending 2015 GT&S rate
case.  If the $850 million is not exhausted by designated safety-related projects and programs in the 2015 GT&S proceeding, the CPUC will identify additional projects in future
proceedings to ensure that the full $850 million is spent. The CPUC is expected to issue a final decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case in 2016 to identify safety-related
projects and programs that will be subject to the disallowance. It is uncertain how much of the Utility’s costs to perform the safety-related projects and programs the CPUC will
identify as counting toward the $850 million shareholder-funded obligation. If the Utility’s actual costs exceed costs that the CPUC counts towards the $850 million maximum,
the Utility would record additional charges if such costs are not otherwise authorized by the CPUC.  As a result, the total shareholder-funded obligation could exceed $850
million.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Utility recorded additional charges in operating and maintenance expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income of

$907 million as a result of the Penalty Decision. The cumulative charges at December 31, 2015, and the additional future charges to reach the $1.6 billion total are shown in the

(1) In March 2015, the Utility increased its accrual from $200 million at December 31, 2014 to $300 million.
(2) The Penalty Decision prohibits the Utility from recovering certain expenses and capital spending associated with pipeline safety-related projects and prog rams that the CPUC will identify in the final decision
to be issued in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate c ase.   The Utility estimates that approximately $407 mi llion of capital spending (which include less than $1 million for remedy related capital costs) in the year
ended December 31, 2015 is probable of disallowance, subject to adjustment based on the final 2015 GT&S rate case decision.

(3) These costs are being expensed as incurred. Future GT&S revenues will be reduced for these unrecovered expenses.
(4) In the Penalty Decision, the CPUC estimated that the Utility would incur $50 million to comply with the remedies specified in the Penalty Decision and does not reflect the Utility’s remedy-related costs

already incurred nor the Utility’s estimated future remedy-related costs. These costs are being expensed as incurred .

Other
Legal
and
Regulatory
Contingencies

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims and

lawsuits.  In addition, penalties may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.   A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is
both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated
losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a
loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies
a re reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of
legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s policy is to exclude anticipated legal costs from the
provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred.

Investigation
of
the
Butte
Fire

In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the “Butte f ire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.   The California Department of

Forestry and Fire Protection (“Cal Fire”) is i nvestigating the source of the Butte F ire to determine whether a tree contacted a power line operated by the Utility and was the
cause of the fire.  Cal Fire has reported that as a result of the fire there were two deaths and 965 structures, including 571 houses, were damaged or destroyed. Cal Fire’s
investigation is expected to conclude in 2016.

Approximately 27 complaints have been filed against the Utility and its vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California in both the County of

Calaveras and the County of San Francisco, involving more than 600 individual plaintiffs and their insurance companies. Plaintiffs and the Utility filed petitions with the
California Judicial Council to coordinate these cases.  The petitions were assigned to the Calaveras Superior Court for a recommendation to the Judicial Council.  On January 21,
2016, the Calaveras Superior Court issued an order recommending to the Judicial Council that the cases be coordinated in the Superior Court of California, Sacramento County,
for all purposes including trial.  Among other factors, the Court found that coordination requires a court with a significant number of judges and complex litigation support
personnel, neither of which are present in Calaveras County.

It is estimated that losses related to structures, contents, other personal property, and fire suppression costs associated with the Butte fire, will range from $350 million

to $450 million.  This range is based on estimates about the number, size, and type of structures damaged or destroyed, assumptions about the contents of such structures and
other personal property damage, and information about the amount of fire suppression costs asso ciated with prior similar fires.  Th e Utility believes that it is reasonably possible
that it would be liable for some or all of these and other costs, such as costs associated with tree damage, personal injury, business interruption losses, and other damages.  The
Utility is unable to reasonably estimate these other costs at this time due to the limited information available.

The Utility has insurance coverage for these types of claims. If the amount of insurance is insufficient to cover the Utility's liability resulting from the Butte fire, or if

insurance is otherwise unavailable, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected.

Rehearing
of
CPUC
Decisions
Approving
Energy
Efficiency
Incentive
Awards

On September 17, 2015, the CPUC issued an order granting TURN’s and the ORA’s long-standing applications for rehearing of the CPUC decisions that awarded

energy efficiency incentive payments to the California investor-owned utilities for the 2006-2008 energy efficiency program cycle.   Under the ratemaking mechanism applicable
to the 2006-2008 program cycle, the maximum amount of incentives that the Utility could have earned (or the maximum amount that the Utility could have been required to
reimburse customers) over the 2006-2008 program cycle was $180 million.   The Utility was awarded a total of $104 million for the 2006-2008 program cycle.   In the re-opened
energy efficiency proceeding, the CPUC will evaluate whether incentives awarded to the California investor-owned utilities were just and reasonable, and whether any refunds
are due.  The parties are required to submit proposals to resolve the issues in the proceeding by March 18 , 2016.   Comments on the proposals are due on April 8 , 2016 and
evidentiary hearings, if needed, would be held in July 2016.   It is uncertain when the CPUC will issue a decision and whether the Utility will be required to refund amounts or
incur other obligations related to the 2006-2008 program cycle.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is reasonably possible that the Utility will be required to refund
amounts or incur other obligations related to this matter, but they are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of such refunds or other obligations.

Other
Contingencies

Accruals for other legal and regulatory contingencies (excluding amounts related to the contingencies discussed above under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” and
“Other Legal and Regulatory Contingencies” ) totaled $ 63 million at December 31 , 2015, and $55 million at December 31, 2014.  These amounts are included in other current
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

123

Environm
ental
Remediation
Contingencies

Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for

estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment.   The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicate
that remediation is probable and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts.  The Utility records an environmental remediation liability based on
the lower end of the range of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.   Amounts recorded are not discounted to
their present value.  The Utility’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is composed of the
following:

(in
millions)
Topock natural gas compressor station (1)
Hinkley natural gas compressor station (1)
Former manufactured gas plant sites owned by the Utility or third parties
Utility-owned generation facilities (other than fossil fuel-fired),

At December 31, 2015 the Utility expected to recover $ 695 million of its environmental remediation liability through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by the

CPUC.  One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites (including the Topock site)
without a reasonableness review. T he Utility may incur environmental remediation costs that it does not seek to recover in rates, such as the co sts associated with the Hinkley
site.

Natural
Gas
Compressor
Station
Sites

The Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas compressor

stations.  One of these stations is located near Hinkley, California and is referred to below as the “Hinkley site.”  Another station is located near Needles, California and is
referred to below as the “Topock site.” The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.

Hinkley
Site

The Utility has been implementing interim remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume and to monitor and control movement of

the plume. The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the Regional Board.   O n November 4, 201 5 , the
Regional Board adopted a final clean-up and abatement order to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the po tential environmental
impacts.  The final order states that the Utility must continue and improve its remediation efforts; define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action.
Additionally, the final order requires set ting plume capture requirements, requires establish ing a monitoring and reporting program , and finalizes deadlines for the Utility to
meet interim cleanup targets.  The clean-up and abatement order did not have a material impact on the Utility’s consolidated financial statements.

The Utility’s environmental remediation liability at December 31, 201 5 reflects the Utility’s best estimate of probable future costs associated with its final remediation
plan.   Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work to be performed to implement the f inal remediation plan and the Utility’s required time frame for
remediation.  Future changes in cost estimates and the assumptions on which they are based may have a material impact on future financial condition and cash flows.

124

Topock
Site

The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California D epartment of T oxic S ubstances C ontrol

and the U.S. Department of the Inter ior.  I n November 201 5 , the Utility submitted its final remediation design to the agencies for approval.  The Utility’s design proposes that
the Utility construct an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic and non-soluble form of chromium.  The DTSC is conducting an
additional environmental review of the proposed design , and the Utility anticipates that the DTSC’s draft environmental impact report will be issued for public comment in July
2016.  After the DTSC considers public comments that may be made, the DTSC is expected to issue a final environmental impact report in December 2016.  After the Utility
modifies its design in response to the final report, the Utility plans to seek approval to begin construction of the new in-situ treatment system in early 2017.

The Utility’s environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2015 reflects its best estimate of probable future costs associated with its final remediation plan.
Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work to be performed to implement the final groundwater remedy and the Utility’s required time frame for
remediation.  Future changes in cost estimates and the assumptions on which they are based may have a material impact on future financial condition and cash flows.

Reasonably
Possible
Environmental
Contingencies

Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the Utility’s undiscounted future costs could

increase to as much as $ 1.9 billion (including amounts related to the Hinkley and Topock sites described above ) if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is
greater than anticipated or if the other potentially responsible parties are not financially ab le to contribute to these costs .   The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are
materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations during the period in which they are recorded.

Nuclear
Insurance

The Utility is a member of NEIL, which is a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities.  NEIL provides insurance coverage for property damages and

business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired Humboldt Bay
Unit 3. NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $ 3.5 billion per nuclear incident and $ 2.8 billion per non-nuclear incident for Diablo
Canyon .  Humboldt Bay Unit 3 has up to $ 131 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages.  If NEIL losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds,
the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment, as of December 31 , 201 5 , the current maximum aggregate annual
retrospective premium obligation for the Utility is approximately $ 60 million.

NEIL also provide s coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants.  Certain acts of terrorism may be “certified” by the Secretary of the

Treasury.  If damages are caused by certified acts of terrorism, NEIL can obtain compensation from the federal government and will provide up to its full policy limit of $3. 5
billion for each insured loss.  In contrast, NEIL would treat all non-certified terrorist acts occurring within a 12-month period against one or more commercial nuclear power
plants insured by NEIL as one event and the owners of the affected plants would share the $3. 5 billion policy limit amount.

Under the Price-Anderson Act, public liability claims that arise from nuclear incid ents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation of material

to and from Diablo Canyon are limited to $13. 5 billion.  The Utility purchased the maximum available public liability insurance of $375 million for Diablo Canyon.  The
balance of the $13. 5 billion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclear reactors.  The Utility may be assessed up to $255
million per nuclear incident under this program, with payments in each year limited to a m aximum of $38 million per incident.  Both the maximum assessment and the
maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.  The next scheduled adjustment is due on or before September 10, 2018 .

The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to a fuel
fabricator or that occur at the fuel fabricator’s facility.  The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidents up to a maximum
of $ 375 million per incident. In addition, the Utility has $ 53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a $ 500 million indemnification from the NRC for
public liability arising from nuclear incidents, covering liabilities in excess of the lia bility insurance.

Resolution
of
Remaining
Chapter
11
Disputed
Claims

Various electricity suppliers filed claims in the Utility’s proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energy supplied to the

Utility’s customers between May 2000 and June 2001.  These claims, which the Utility disputes, are being addressed in various FERC and judicial proceedings in which the State
of California, the Utility, and other electricity purchasers are seeking refunds from electricity suppliers, including governmental entities, for overcharges incurred in the CAISO
and the California Power Exchange wholesale electricity markets during this period .

At December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $ 454 million and $434 million, respectively, in net Disputed claims and

customer refunds, including both principal and interest. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Utility held $ 228 million and $291 million, respectively, in escrow, including
earned interest, for payment of the remaining net disputed claims liability.  These amounts are included within restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Interest accrues on the remaining net disputed claims liability at the FERC-ordered rate, which is higher than the rate earned by the Utility on the escrow balance.

Although the Utility has been collecting the difference between the accrued interest and the earned interest from customers in rates , these collections are not held in escrow.  If
the amount of accrued interest is greater than the amount of interest ultimately determined to be owed on the remaining net disputed claims liability , the Utility would refund to
customers any excess interest collected.  The amount of any interest that the Utility may be required to pay will depend on the final determined amount of the remaining net
disputed claims liability and when such interest is paid.

While the FERC and judicial proceedings are pending, the Utility has pursued, and continues to pursue, settlements with electricity suppliers.  The Utility has entered

into a number of settlement agreement s with various electricity suppliers to resolve some of these disputed claims and to resolve the Utility’s refund claims against these
electricity suppliers.  Under these settlement agreements, a mounts payable by the parties are, in some instances, subject to adjustment based on the outcome of the various
refund offset and interest issues being considered by the FER C.  Any net refunds, claim offsets, or other credits that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either through
settlement or through the conclusion of the various FERC and judicial proceedings are refunded to customers through rates in future periods.

In July 2014, a settlement agreement between the Utility and an electric supplier became effective, resolving a portion of the Utility’s net disputed claims and resulting
in refunds to customers of $ 312 million.  No significant settlement agreements were reached in 2015.  The Utility is uncertain when and how the remaining net disputed claims
liability will be resolved.

Third-Party
Power
Purchase
Agreements

In the ordinary course of business, the Utility enters into various agreements , including renewable energy agreements, QF agreements, and other power purchase

agreements to purchase power and electric capacity .  The price of purchased power may be fixed or variable.  Variable pricing is generally based on the current market price of
either natural gas or el ectricity at the date of delivery.

Renewable
Energy
Power
Purchase
Agreement
s
.

In order to comply with California’s RPS requirements, the Utility is required to deliver renewable energy to its
customers at a gradually increasing rate. The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase renewable energy to help meet California’s requirement . The Utility’s
obligations under a significant portion of these agreements are contingent on the third party’s construction of new generation facilities, which are expected to grow significantly.
As of December 31, 2015, renewable energy contracts expire at various dates between 2016 and 2043 .

Conventional
Energy
Power
Purchase
Agreements
.

T he Utility has entered into many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources, which

include tolling agreements and resource adequacy agreements .  The Utility’s obligation under a portion of these agreements is contingent on the third part ies ’ development of
new generation facilit ies to provide capacity and energy products to the Utility .   As of December 31, 2015, these power purchase agreements expire at various dates between
2016 and 2033 .

Other
Power
Purchase
Agreements.

The Utility has entered into agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that own generation

facilities that meet the definition of a QF under federal law.  Several of these agreements are treated as capital leases.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , net capital leases
reflected in property, plant, and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $ 54 million and $74 million including accumulated amortization of $ 147 million and $ 128
millio n, respectively.  The present value of the future minimum lease payments due under these agreements included $ 19 million and $20 million in Current Liabilities and $ 35
million and $54 million in Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , QF contracts in operation expire at various dates
between 2016 and 2028 .  In addition, t he Utility has agreements with various irrigation districts and water agenci es to purchase hydroelectric power.

The costs incurred for all power purchase s and electric capacity amounted to $ 3.5 billion in 2015, $3.6 billion in 2014, and $3.0 billion in 2013.

Natural
Gas
Supply,
Transportation,
and
Storage
Commitments

The Utility purchases natural gas directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States to serve its core customers and to fuel its owned-

generation facilities .  The Utility also contracts for natural gas transportation from the points at which the Utility takes delivery (typically in Canada , the US Rocky Mountain
supply area, and the southwestern United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.   These agreements expire at various dates between
2016 and 2026.  In addition, the Utility has contracted for natural gas storage services in northern California in order to more reliably meet customers’ loads.

Costs incurred for natural gas purchases, natural gas transportation services, and natural ga s storage, which include contracts with terms of less than 1 year, amounted

to $ 0.9 billion in 2015 , $1.4 billion in 2014 , and $1.6 billion in 2013 .

Nuclear
Fuel
Agreements

The Utility has entered into several purchase agreements for nuclear fuel.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2016 and 2025 and are intended to ensure
long-term nuclear fuel supply.  T he Utility relies on a number of international producers of nuclear fuel in order to diversify its sources and provide security of supply.  Pricing
terms are also diversified, ranging from market-based prices to base prices that are escalated using published indices.

Payments for nuclear fuel amounted to $128 milli on in 2015 , $105 million in 2014 , and $162 million in 2013 .

127

O
ther
Commitments

PG&E Corporation and t he Utility have other commitments related to operating leases (primarily office facilities and land), which expire at various dates between 2016

and 2052 .  At December 31, 2015 , the future minimum payments related to these commitments were as follows:

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT

ON
INTERNAL
CONTROL
OVER

FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Management of PG&E Corporation and Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.     PG&E

Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.     Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of PG&E Corporation and the
Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—

Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.     Based on its assessment and those criteria, management
has concluded that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 .

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting as

of December   31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal
Control

REPORT

FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company
San Francisco, California

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PG&E Cor poration and subsidiaries (the “ Company ” ) and of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and
subsidiaries (the “Utility”) as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal
Control
—
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company ’ s and the Utility ’ s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management
’
s
Report
on
Internal
Control
Over
Financial
Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company ’ s and the Utility ’ s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audit s in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan

and perform the audit s to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit s
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company ’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company ’ s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company ’ s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company ’ s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company ’ s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,

material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control
over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company and the Utility maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on

the criteria established in Internal
Control
—
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of

and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and the Utility and our report dated February 18, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements.

ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company
San Francisco, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PG&E Cor poration and subsidiaries (the “ Company ” ) and of Pacific Gas and Electric Company

and subsidiaries (the “Utility”) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the Company ’ s related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash
flows and the Utility ’ s related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2015 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company ’ s and the Utility ’ s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan

and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries and of Pacific

Gas and Electric Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2015 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company ’ s and the Utility’s internal

control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework

control over financial reporting.

For performance shares, amounts reflected in this table assume payout in shares at 200% of target or, for performance shares granted in 2013, reflects the actual payout percentage of 50%.  The actual number
of shares issued can range from 0% to 200% of target depending on achievement of performance objectives.  Also, restricted stock units and performance shares are generally settled in net shares.  Upon
vesting, shares with a value equal to required tax withholding will be withheld and, in lieu of issuing the shares, taxes will be paid on behalf of employees.  Shares not issued due to share withholding or
performance achievement below maximum will be available again for issuance.

San Francisco, California

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) and Pacific Gas and Electric Company and subsidiaries (the “U
tility”) as of December 31, 2015 and 201 4 , and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 201 5 , and the Company's and the Utility’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 201 5 , and have issued our reports thereon dated February 1 8 , 201 6; such reports are included in this Form 10-K . Our audits also
included the consolidated financial statement schedules of the Company and the Utility listed in Item 15. These consolidated financial statement schedules are the responsibility
of the Company's and the Utility’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between you and PG&E Corporation regarding the Restricted Stock Units, subject to
the terms of the LTIP.  Any prior agreements, commitments, or negotiations are superseded.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency
between the provisions of this Agreement and the LTIP, the LTIP shall govern.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement
are  defined  in  the  LTIP.    In  the  event  of  any  conflict  between  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  and  the  PG&E  Corporation  Officer
Severance Policy or the PG&E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy, this Agreement shall govern. For purposes of this Agreement,
employment with PG&E Corporation shall mean employment with any member of the Participating Company Group.
PG&E Corporation grants you the number of Restricted Stock Units shown on the cover sheet of this Agreement.  The Restricted Stock
Units are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the LTIP.
As long as you remain employed with PG&E Corporation, the total number of Restricted Stock Units originally subject to this Agreement,
as  shown  above  on  the  cover  sheet,  will  vest  in  accordance  with  the  below  vesting  schedule  ([collectively],  the  "Normal  Vesting
Schedule")
4,607 on August 17, 2017
4,607 on August 17, 2018
The  amounts  payable  upon  each  vesting  date  are  hereby  designated  separate  payments  for  purposes  of  Code  Section  409A.    Except  as
described below, all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement which have not vested upon termination of your employment shall
then be automatically cancelled. As set forth below, the Restricted Stock Units may vest earlier upon the occurrence of certain events.
Restricted Stock Units will accrue Dividend Equivalents in the event cash dividends are paid with respect to PG&E Corporation common
stock having a record date prior to the date on which the Restricted Stock Units are settled.  Such Dividend Equivalents will be converted
into cash and paid, if at all, upon settlement of the underlying Restricted Stock Units.
Vested Restricted Stock Units will be settled in an equal number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction
of Withholding Taxes, as described below.  PG&E Corporation shall issue shares as soon as practicable after the Restricted Stock Units
vest  in  accordance  with  the  Normal  Vesting  Schedule  (but  not  later  than  sixty  (60)  days  after  the  applicable  vesting  date);  provided,
however, that such issuance shall, if earlier, be made with respect to all of your outstanding vested Restricted Stock Units (after giving
effect to the vesting provisions described below) as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the earliest to occur
of  your  (1)  Disability  (as  defined  under  Code  Section  409A),  (2)  death  or  (3)  "separation  from  service,"  within  the  meaning  of  Code
Section 409A within 2 years following a Change in Control.
In the event of your voluntary termination, all unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled on the date of termination.

If  your  employment  with  PG&E  Corporation  is  terminated  at  any  time  by  PG&E  Corporation  for  cause,  all  unvested  Restricted  Stock
Units  will  be  cancelled  on  the  date  of  termination.    In  general,  termination  for  "cause"  means  termination  of  employment  because  of
dishonesty, a criminal offense or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG&E Corporation.
If your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause and you are an officer in Bands 1-5,
any unvested Restricted Stock Units that would have vested during the period of the "Severance Multiple" under the PG&E Corporation
Officer Severance Policy or the PG&E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy (as applicable at the time of termination) will continue
to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed), subject to the
earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  In the event of your involuntary termination other than for cause, if you are not an officer
in  Bands  1-5,  any  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  that  would  have  vested  within  the  12  months  following  such  termination  had  your
employment continued will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement
that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  All other unvested Restricted Stock Units will be
cancelled unless your termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below.
In the event of your death or Disability while you are employed, all of your Restricted Stock Units shall vest and be settled as soon as
practicable  after  (but  not  later  than  sixty  (60)  days  after)  the  date  of  such  event.    If  your  death  or  Disability  occurs  following  the
termination  of  your  employment  and  your  Restricted  Stock  Units  are  then  outstanding  under  the  terms  hereof,  then  all  of  your  vested
Restricted Stock Units plus any Restricted Stock Units that would have otherwise vested during any continued vesting period hereunder
shall be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of your death or Disability.

(1) If your employment is terminated (other than termination for cause, your voluntary termination) by reason of a divestiture or change in
control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longer qualifying as a
subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or (2) if your employment is
terminated (other than termination for cause, or your voluntary termination) coincident with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest and be settled in the same manner as for a "Termination other
than for Cause" described above.
In  the  event  of  a  Change  in  Control,  the  surviving,  continuing,  successor,  or  purchasing  corporation  or  other  business  entity  or  parent
thereof,  as  the  case  may  be  (the  "Acquiror  "
),  may,  without  your  consent,  either  assume  or  continue  PG&E  Corporation's  rights  and
obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units subject to this
Agreement.
If  the  Restricted  Stock  Units  are  neither  assumed  nor  continued  by  the  Acquiror  or  if  the  Acquiror  does  not  provide  a  substantially
equivalent  award  in  substitution  for  the  Restricted  Stock  Units,  all  of  your  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  shall  automatically  vest
immediately preceding and contingent on, the Change in Control and be settled in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule, subject
to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.
If you separate from service (other than termination for cause, your voluntary termination) in connection with a Change in Control within
three months before the Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Restricted Stock Units (including Restricted Stock Units that
you would have otherwise forfeited after the end of the continued vesting period) shall automatically vest on the date of the Change in
Control and will be settled  in accordance  with the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement  that you be employed)
subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  In the event of such a separation in connection with a Change in Control
within  two  years  following  the  Change  in  Control,  your  Restricted  Stock  Units  (to  the  extent  they  did  not  previously  vest  upon,  for
example,  failure  of the Acquiror  to assume  or continue  this Award) shall  automatically  vest on the date of such separation  and will be
settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of such separation.  PG&E Corporation shall have the
sole discretion to determine whether termination of your employment was made in connection with a Change in Control

Law

PG&E Corporation shall delay the issuance of any shares of common stock to the extent it is necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)
(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to certain "key employees" of certain publicly-traded companies); in such event, any shares
of common stock to which you would otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period following the date of your "separation from
service" under Section 409A (or shorter period ending on the date of your death following such separation) will instead be issued on the
first business day following the expiration of the applicable delay period.
The number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive upon settlement of Restricted Stock
Units will be reduced by a number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG&E Corporation, equal to the
amount  of  any  Federal,  state,  or  local  taxes  of  any  kind  required  by  law  to  be  withheld  by  PG&E  Corporation  in  connection  with  the
Restricted  Stock  Units  determined  using  the  applicable  minimum  statutory  withholding  rates  ,  including  social  security  and  Medicare
taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax (" Withholding Taxes").  If the
withheld  shares  were  not  sufficient  to  satisfy  your  minimum  Withholding  Taxes,  you  will  be  required  to  pay,  as  soon  as  practicable,
including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Withholding Taxes that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares
described above .

For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG&E Corporation, or a recipient of PG&E Corporation
sponsored  disability  benefits,  you  will  continue  to  be  considered  as  employed.    If  you  do  not  return  to  active  employment  upon  the
expiration of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG&E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered to
have voluntarily terminated your employment.  See above under "Voluntary Termination."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service upon expiration of such leave is not
guaranteed by statute or contract, then you shall be deemed to have had a "separation from service" for purposes of any Restricted Stock
Units that are settled hereunder upon such separation.  To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due to a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least six (6) months and such
impairment  causes  you  to  be  unable  to  perform  the  duties  of  your  position  of  employment  or  any  substantially  similar  position  of
employment, the six (6) month period in the prior sentence shall be twenty-nine (29) months.
PG&E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as continuing employment and when your
employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement.
You shall not have voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units until the date the underlying shares are issued (as evidenced by
appropriate entry on the books of PG&E Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent).
This  Agreement  is  not  an  employment  agreement  and  does  not  give  you  the  right  to  be  retained  by  PG&E  Corporation.    Except  as
otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement, PG&E Corporation reserves the right to terminate your employment at any
time and for any reason.
This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of California.

of Withholding Taxes, as described below.  PG&E Corporation shall issue shares as soon as practicable after the Restricted Stock Units
vest  in  accordance  with  the  Normal  Vesting  Schedule  (but  not  later  than  sixty  (60)  days  after  the  applicable  vesting  date);  provided,
however, that such issuance shall, if earlier, be made with respect to all of your outstanding vested Restricted Stock Units (after giving
effect to the vesting provisions described below) as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the earliest to occur
of  your  (1)  Disability  (as  defined  under  Code  Section  409A),  (2)  death  or  (3)  "separation  from  service,"  within  the  meaning  of  Code
Section 409A within 2 years following a Change in Control.
In the event of your voluntary termination, all unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled on the date of termination.

If  your  employment  with  PG&E  Corporation  is  terminated  at  any  time  by  PG&E  Corporation  for  cause,  all  unvested  Restricted  Stock
Units  will  be  cancelled  on  the  date  of  termination.    In  general,  termination  for  "cause"  means  termination  of  employment  because  of
dishonesty, a criminal offense or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG&E Corporation.
If your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause and you are an officer in Bands 1-5,
any unvested Restricted Stock Units that would have vested during the period of the "Severance Multiple" under the PG&E Corporation
Officer Severance Policy or the PG&E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy (as applicable at the time of termination) will continue
to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed), subject to the
earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  In the event of your involuntary termination other than for cause, if you are not an officer
in  Bands  1-5,  any  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  that  would  have  vested  within  the  12  months  following  such  termination  had  your
employment continued will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement
that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  All other unvested Restricted Stock Units will be
cancelled unless your termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below.
In the event of your death or Disability while you are employed, all of your Restricted Stock Units shall vest and be settled as soon as
practicable  after  (but  not  later  than  sixty  (60)  days  after)  the  date  of  such  event.    If  your  death  or  Disability  occurs  following  the
termination  of  your  employment  and  your  Restricted  Stock  Units  are  then  outstanding  under  the  terms  hereof,  then  all  of  your  vested
Restricted Stock Units plus any Restricted Stock Units that would have otherwise vested during any continued vesting period hereunder
shall be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of your death or Disability.

(1) If your employment is terminated (other than termination for cause, your voluntary termination) by reason of a divestiture or change in
control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary no longer qualifying as a
subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or (2) if your employment is
terminated (other than termination for cause, or your voluntary termination) coincident with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest and be settled in the same manner as for a "Termination other
than for Cause" described above.
In  the  event  of  a  Change  in  Control,  the  surviving,  continuing,  successor,  or  purchasing  corporation  or  other  business  entity  or  parent
thereof,  as  the  case  may  be  (the  "Acquiror  "
),  may,  without  your  consent,  either  assume  or  continue  PG&E  Corporation's  rights  and
obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units subject to this
Agreement.
If  the  Restricted  Stock  Units  are  neither  assumed  nor  continued  by  the  Acquiror  or  if  the  Acquiror  does  not  provide  a  substantially
equivalent  award  in  substitution  for  the  Restricted  Stock  Units,  all  of  your  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  shall  automatically  vest
immediately preceding and contingent on, the Change in Control and be settled in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule, subject
to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.
If you separate from service (other than termination for cause, your voluntary termination) in connection with a Change in Control within
three months before the Change in Control occurs, all of your outstanding Restricted Stock Units (including Restricted Stock Units that
you would have otherwise forfeited after the end of the continued vesting period) shall automatically vest on the date of the Change in
Control and will be settled  in accordance  with the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement  that you be employed)
subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  In the event of such a separation in connection with a Change in Control
within  two  years  following  the  Change  in  Control,  your  Restricted  Stock  Units  (to  the  extent  they  did  not  previously  vest  upon,  for
example,  failure  of the Acquiror  to assume  or continue  this Award) shall  automatically  vest on the date of such separation  and will be
settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of such separation.  PG&E Corporation shall have the
sole discretion to determine whether termination of your employment was made in connection with a Change in Control

PG&E Corporation shall delay the issuance of any shares of common stock to the extent it is necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)
(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to certain "key employees" of certain publicly-traded companies); in such event, any shares
of common stock to which you would otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period following the date of your "separation from
service" under Section 409A (or shorter period ending on the date of your death following such separation) will instead be issued on the
first business day following the expiration of the applicable delay period.
The number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive upon settlement of Restricted Stock
Units will be reduced by a number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG&E Corporation, equal to the
amount  of  any  Federal,  state,  or  local  taxes  of  any  kind  required  by  law  to  be  withheld  by  PG&E  Corporation  in  connection  with  the
Restricted  Stock  Units  determined  using  the  applicable  minimum  statutory  withholding  rates  ,  including  social  security  and  Medicare
taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax (" Withholding Taxes").  If the
withheld  shares  were  not  sufficient  to  satisfy  your  minimum  Withholding  Taxes,  you  will  be  required  to  pay,  as  soon  as  practicable,
including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Withholding Taxes that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares
described above .

For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG&E Corporation, or a recipient of PG&E Corporation
sponsored  disability  benefits,  you  will  continue  to  be  considered  as  employed.    If  you  do  not  return  to  active  employment  upon  the
expiration of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG&E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered to
have voluntarily terminated your employment.  See above under "Voluntary Termination."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service upon expiration of such leave is not
guaranteed by statute or contract, then you shall be deemed to have had a "separation from service" for purposes of any Restricted Stock
Units that are settled hereunder upon such separation.  To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due to a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least six (6) months and such
impairment  causes  you  to  be  unable  to  perform  the  duties  of  your  position  of  employment  or  any  substantially  similar  position  of
employment, the six (6) month period in the prior sentence shall be twenty-nine (29) months.
PG&E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as continuing employment and when your
employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement.
You shall not have voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units until the date the underlying shares are issued (as evidenced by
appropriate entry on the books of PG&E Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent).
This  Agreement  is  not  an  employment  agreement  and  does  not  give  you  the  right  to  be  retained  by  PG&E  Corporation.    Except  as
otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement, PG&E Corporation reserves the right to terminate your employment at any
time and for any reason.
This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of California.

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between you and PG&E Corporation regarding the Restricted Stock Units, subject to
the terms of the LTIP.  Any prior agreements, commitments, or negotiations are superseded.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency
between the provisions of this Agreement and the LTIP, the LTIP shall govern.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement
are  defined  in  the  LTIP.    In  the  event  of  any  conflict  between  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  and  the  PG&E  Corporation  Officer
Severance Policy or the PG&E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy, this Agreement shall govern. For purposes of this Agreement,
employment with PG&E Corporation shall mean employment with any member of the Participating Company Group.
PG&E Corporation grants you the number of Restricted Stock Units shown on the cover sheet of this Agreement.  The Restricted Stock
Units are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the LTIP.
As long as you remain employed with PG&E Corporation, the total number of Restricted Stock Units originally subject to this Agreement,
as  shown  above  on  the  cover  sheet,  will  vest  in  accordance  with  the  below  vesting  schedule  ([collectively],  the  "Normal  Vesting
Schedule")
3,685 on August 17, 2017
3,686 on August 17, 2018
The  amounts  payable  upon  each  vesting  date  are  hereby  designated  separate  payments  for  purposes  of  Code  Section  409A.    Except  as
described below, all Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement which have not vested upon termination of your employment shall
then be automatically cancelled. As set forth below, the Restricted Stock Units may vest earlier upon the occurrence of certain events.
Restricted Stock Units will accrue Dividend Equivalents in the event cash dividends are paid with respect to PG&E Corporation common
stock having a record date prior to the date on which the Restricted Stock Units are settled.  Such Dividend Equivalents will be converted
into cash and paid, if at all, upon settlement of the underlying Restricted Stock Units.
Vested Restricted Stock Units will be settled in an equal number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, subject to the satisfaction
of Withholding Taxes, as described below.  PG&E Corporation shall issue shares as soon as practicable after the Restricted Stock Units
vest  in  accordance  with  the  Normal  Vesting  Schedule  (but  not  later  than  sixty  (60)  days  after  the  applicable  vesting  date);  provided,
however, that such issuance shall, if earlier, be made with respect to all of your outstanding vested Restricted Stock Units (after giving
effect to the vesting provisions described below) as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the earliest to occur
of  your  (1)  Disability  (as  defined  under  Code  Section  409A),  (2)  death  or  (3)  "separation  from  service,"  within  the  meaning  of  Code
Section 409A within 2 years following a Change in Control.
In the event of your voluntary termination [(other than Retirement)], all unvested Restricted Stock Units will be cancelled on the date of
termination.
In  the  event  of  your  Retirement,  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  will  continue  to  vest  and  be  settled  pursuant  to  the  Normal  Vesting
Schedule  (without  regard  to  the  requirement  that  you  be  employed),  subject  to  the  earlier  settlement  provisions  of  this  Agreement;
provided, however that in the event of your Retirement within 2 years following a Change in Control, all of your Restricted Stock Units
shall  vest  and  be  settled  as  soon  as  practicable  after  (but  not  later  than  sixty  (60)  days  after)  the  date  of  such  event.    Your  voluntary
termination of employment will be considered to be a Retirement if you are both age 55 or older on the date of termination and if you were
employed by PG&E Corporation for at least five consecutive years ending on the date of termination of your employment.]
If  your  employment  with  PG&E  Corporation  is  terminated  at  any  time  by  PG&E  Corporation  for  cause,  all  unvested  Restricted  Stock
Units  will  be  cancelled  on  the  date  of  termination.    In  general,  termination  for  "cause"  means  termination  of  employment  because  of
dishonesty, a criminal offense or violation of a work rule, and will be determined by and in the sole discretion of PG&E Corporation.
If your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause and you are an officer in Bands 1-5,
any unvested Restricted Stock Units that would have vested during the period of the "Severance Multiple" under the PG&E Corporation
Officer Severance Policy or the PG&E Corporation 2012 Officer Severance Policy (as applicable at the time of termination) will continue
to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed), subject to the
earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  In the event of your involuntary termination other than for cause, if you are not an officer
in  Bands  1-5,  any  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  that  would  have  vested  within  the  12  months  following  such  termination  had  your
employment continued will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement
that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  All other unvested Restricted Stock Units will be
cancelled unless your termination of employment was in connection with a Change in Control as provided below.
In the event of your death or Disability while you are employed, all of your Restricted Stock Units shall vest and be settled as soon as
practicable  after  (but  not  later  than  sixty  (60)  days  after)  the  date  of  such  event.    If  your  death  or  Disability  occurs  following  the
termination  of  your  employment  and  your  Restricted  Stock  Units  are  then  outstanding  under  the  terms  hereof,  then  all  of  your  vested
Restricted Stock Units plus any Restricted Stock Units that would have otherwise vested during any continued vesting period hereunder
shall be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of your death or Disability.
(1) If your employment is terminated (other than termination for cause, [or]  your voluntary termination[, or your Retirement]) by reason
of a divestiture or change in control of a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, which divestiture or change in control results in such subsidiary
no longer qualifying as a subsidiary corporation under Section 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or
(2) if your employment is terminated (other than termination for cause, [or] your voluntary termination[, or your Retirement]) coincident
with the  sale  of all  or substantially  all  of the assets  of a subsidiary  of PG&E Corporation,  the Restricted  Stock  Units shall  vest  and be
settled in the same manner as for a "Termination other than for Cause" described above.
In  the  event  of  a  Change  in  Control,  the  surviving,  continuing,  successor,  or  purchasing  corporation  or  other  business  entity  or  parent
thereof,  as  the  case  may  be  (the  "Acquiror  "
),  may,  without  your  consent,  either  assume  or  continue  PG&E  Corporation's  rights  and
obligations under this Agreement or provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units subject to this
Agreement.
If  the  Restricted  Stock  Units  are  neither  assumed  nor  continued  by  the  Acquiror  or  if  the  Acquiror  does  not  provide  a  substantially
equivalent  award  in  substitution  for  the  Restricted  Stock  Units,  all  of  your  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  shall  automatically  vest
immediately preceding and contingent on, the Change in Control and be settled in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule, subject
to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.
If you separate from service (other than termination for cause, [or] your voluntary termination[, or your Retirement]) in connection with a
Change  in  Control  within  three  months  before  the  Change  in  Control  occurs,  all  of  your  outstanding  Restricted  Stock  Units  (including
Restricted Stock Units that you would have otherwise forfeited after the end of the continued vesting period) shall automatically vest on
the date of the Change in Control and will be settled in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement

that you be employed) subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.  In the event of such a separation in connection with
a Change in Control within two years following the Change in Control, your Restricted Stock Units (to the extent they did not previously
vest upon, for example, failure of the Acquiror to assume or continue this Award) shall automatically vest on the date of such separation
and will be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of such separation.  PG&E Corporation
shall have the sole discretion to determine whether termination of your employment was made in connection with a Change in Control
PG&E Corporation shall delay the issuance of any shares of common stock to the extent it is necessary to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)
(B)(i) of the Code (relating to payments made to certain "key employees" of certain publicly-traded companies); in such event, any shares
of common stock to which you would otherwise be entitled during the six (6) month period following the date of your "separation from
service" under Section 409A (or shorter period ending on the date of your death following such separation) will instead be issued on the
first business day following the expiration of the applicable delay period.
The number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive upon settlement of Restricted Stock
Units will be reduced by a number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined by PG&E Corporation, equal to the
amount  of  any  Federal,  state,  or  local  taxes  of  any  kind  required  by  law  to  be  withheld  by  PG&E  Corporation  in  connection  with  the
Restricted  Stock  Units  determined  using  the  applicable  minimum  statutory  withholding  rates  ,  including  social  security  and  Medicare
taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax (" Withholding Taxes").  If the
withheld  shares  were  not  sufficient  to  satisfy  your  minimum  Withholding  Taxes,  you  will  be  required  to  pay,  as  soon  as  practicable,
including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Withholding Taxes that is not satisfied by the withholding of shares
described above .

For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG&E Corporation, or a recipient of PG&E Corporation
sponsored  disability  benefits,  you  will  continue  to  be  considered  as  employed.    If  you  do  not  return  to  active  employment  upon  the
expiration of your leave of absence or the expiration of your PG&E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will be considered to
have voluntarily terminated your employment.  See above under "Voluntary Termination."
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service upon expiration of such leave is not
guaranteed by statute or contract, then you shall be deemed to have had a "separation from service" for purposes of any Restricted Stock
Units that are settled hereunder upon such separation.  To the extent an authorized leave of absence is due to a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least six (6) months and such
impairment  causes  you  to  be  unable  to  perform  the  duties  of  your  position  of  employment  or  any  substantially  similar  position  of
employment, the six (6) month period in the prior sentence shall be twenty-nine (29) months.
PG&E Corporation reserves the right to determine which leaves of absence will be considered as continuing employment and when your
employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement.
You shall not have voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units until the date the underlying shares are issued (as evidenced by
appropriate entry on the books of PG&E Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent).
This  Agreement  is  not  an  employment  agreement  and  does  not  give  you  the  right  to  be  retained  by  PG&E  Corporation.    Except  as
otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement, PG&E Corporation reserves the right to terminate your employment at any
time and for any reason.
This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of California.

Your
Relocation
Guide

PG&E has established this relocation guide to assist in the financial and service needs of employees who meet the eligibility requirements and wish to relocate.  The guide is
designed to address most events in a typical relocation and is intended to ease the transition to the new location for you and your family.

This guide outlines the various benefits available to you. We suggest that you review it carefully and make note of any questions you have or further information you may need.

Important
Notices

§

PG&E reserves the right to interpret, at its sole discretion, the provisions of this program and to amend, limit or change any of its provisions with or without prior notice.

§ Nothing in this guide should be interpreted as an employment guarantee or as creating an employment contract, expressed or implied, for any duration.

§

§

The intent of the relocation program is to provide reasonable, consistent and cost effective financial assistance and quality services to employees who relocate. The guide
does not offer or imply that all relocation costs will be fully compensated.

This relocation program has been designed to provide tax benefits and cost savings for you and PG&E. If you choose to work outside the guidelines, certain benefits may not
be available to you.

It is expected that you will make every effort to transfer promptly and control the cost of your move whenever possible. You will be reimbursed for reasonable, necessary
and properly authorized eligible expenses.  You are expected to maintain expenses at a conservative level and to be familiar with which expenses are reimbursable. The
Company may, at its discretion, choose not to reimburse, in full or in part, an expense that is deemed unreasonable or excessive.

Expense
Reporting
Tax Liability Most taxable reimbursements are grossed up to compensate for the tax impact on the employee. Gross-up is provided as a financial benefit, but it is not intended to

compensate you completely for all tax liabilities.

Eligibility
for
Benefits

To be eligible for Officer relocation benefits, you must meet the following requirements:

§ Your position is Vice President or higher.

§ You meet the following Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines for a qualified move for tax purposes.

The distance from your former residence to your new work location is 50 miles or greater than the distance from your former residence to your previous work location.

-
- You will be employed full time within the same general commuting area for 39 weeks or more within a 12-month period that begins when you arrive at the new

location.

§

The relocation is between locations within the U.S. or from Canada to the U.S.

§ You complete the relocation benefits requirements within twelve (12) months from your hire date or internal transfer date.

§ You have signed and returned a relocation repayment agreement to the RMC.

Additionally, if you are a current employee transferring to another location, you must also meet the following requirements:

§ You must not have had a relocation paid for by the Company in the last twelve (12) months; and

§

The new position must be a regular, full-time position.

Relocation
Repayment
Agreement

To be eligible for relocation benefits, employees are required to sign and return a Relocation Repayment Agreement to the RMC. An employee who receives relocation
assistance and voluntarily resigns employment within a 24-month period will be required to refund all or part of the monies spent by PG&E, including tax gross-up. Repayment
will be as follows:

Resignation within the 1 st year: 100%

Resignation within the 2 nd year:  50%

If you are involuntarily terminated, you will not be responsible for repayment of any relocation expenses, regardless of the duration of employment at the new location.

No relocation benefits, including payments, will be made until a signed copy of the Relocation Repayment Agreement is on file.  A copy of the Agreement can be found at the
end of this guide.

Miscellaneous
Expense
Allowance

PG&E's relocation program does not cover every expense you are likely to incur during your move. To help you with these various costs, PG&E provides a Miscellaneous
Expense Allowance (MEA) of $7,000 (less applicable gross earning taxes—no gross-up is provided).

The MEA is yours to use as you wish, and no receipt submission to the RMC or PG&E is required. However, you may need to keep receipts for your personal tax records. If in
doubt, keep your receipts and talk to a tax advisor.

The MEA will be distributed directly to you from the RMC via direct deposit or check once your signed Repayment Agreement has been received and you have started work in
your new location. If you are a current employee, you will be responsible for updating your Personnel Change Request in order to receive your MEA.

The MEA may be used to help with expenses such as:

§

Storage or shipment of household goods outside of the parameters outlined in this guide

§ Alcohol, wine and wine cellar shipment

§

§

§

§

§

§

§

Tips to movers

Travel expenses not covered by relocation guide, e.g., airline upgrade fees, preferred seat fees, baggage fees for the home finding trip, and bags in excess of two per person
for the final move trip, etc.

Concessions negotiated in the sale of a home

Express mail charges (Federal Express, UPS, Airborne Express, etc.); notary fees, etc.

Personal telephone calls (long distance, cell phone charges)

Repairs, decorating, installation, wiring, cleaning, landscaping, etc. expenses for old or new home

Security or utility deposits

§ Automobile registration fees, licenses, or smog control charges

§

§

§

§

§

§

Losses of fees for subscriptions, memberships, schools, safety deposit box

Child care expenses

Spouse/domestic partner employment costs

Pet deposits or moving and boarding of pets

Laundry and cleaning

Tax obligations not fully compensated by gross-up

§ GPS and other upgrades not standard for your rental car

Lease
Cancellation

If you are a renter and have a lease to cancel in the departure location, you will be reimbursed for up to 2 months' rent.  Your lease must have been signed prior to the date of the
official relocation.  The intent of this benefit is to cover lease cancellation fees, but not unused rent (i.e. if you are responsible for rent through a given month and move out
midway through the month, the balance of that month's rent is not considered reimbursable as "lease cancellation").

Following is the documentation that you will need to submit for reimbursement:

§ A copy of the current lease signed by the landlord and tenant(s)

§ A copy of the notice to vacate letter that you provided to the landlord or property manager, which includes the date you intend to vacate

§ A response back from your landlord with the dollar amount required to break the lease and confirmation that you have vacated and turned in your keys.  The landlord

will need to outline the costs (i.e. rent, break fee, etc.), associated with breaking the lease.

§

Proof of payment of the amount you paid to the landlord for the lease break.  This can be in the form of a cancelled check (front and back), credit card or bank statement
showing the charge, or a signed/dated receipt from the landlord showing what was paid.

Upload all of the above documents to the website at www.altairglobal.com for reimbursement consideration.  Please provide all required documents together to avoid delays in
reviewing your reimbursement.

Relocation
Clause

If you decide to rent rather than purchase a home in the new location, you should include a relocation clause in your new lease that allows you to terminate the lease without
penalty upon future relocation. The following example may be used:

It is understood the Lessee is subject to transfer by his or her employer. Accordingly, it is agreed in the event of Lessee's transfer at any time prior
to the date on which the last monthly rental payment under this Lease becomes due, Lessor will release Lessee of and from all further obligations
under the Lease as of the last day of the monthly rental period during which Lessee vacates the premises, provided the Lessee gives written notice
to the Lessor 30 days prior to vacating.

you elect to participate in the Home Sale Assistance Program. All construction and/or repairs must be completed prior to requesting to participate in the Program.

PG&E RETAINS THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE FINAL DECISION ON THE ELIGIBILITY OF A HOME FOR THE HOME SALE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

If
your
home
is
ineligible
for
the
Home
Sale
Assistance
Program

In accordance with the criteria identified above, or by the judgment of the RMC and PG&E, you will be responsible for selling your home on your own.  You will still receive
direct reimbursement for reasonable and customary home sales expenses.  For
reference,

list
of
reasonable
and
customary
home
sale
expenses

by
PG&E
can

  Your home sales expense reimbursement will be grossed up.

If
your
home
is
eligible
for
the
Home
Sale
Assistance
Program

In accordance with the criteria listed above and you choose not
to participate in the Home Sale Assistance Program, you will still receive reimbursement for reasonable and
customary home sale expenses; however, none
of
the
expenses
of
the
transaction
will
be
grossed
up.

Step-by-Step
Guide
to
Home
Sale
Assistance
Program

You must follow these steps carefully to ensure compliance with the Home Sale Assistance Program. If
these
steps
are
altered
in
any
way,
your
home
sale
assistance
benefits
may
be
at
risk.

Step
1:

Speak
with
your
RMC
consultant
before
signing
any
agreement(s)
with
real
estate
professionals
regarding

the
sale
of
your
home.

As soon as PG&E authorizes the RMC to provide services, your consultant will contact you to conduct an initial interview. This interview will include discussion of all aspects
of your relocation benefits and the needs that you anticipate for your family during the relocation process.

Step
2:

Broker's
Market
Analysis

After the initial interview, your consultant will order two Broker's Market Analyses of your home and review them with you. A Broker's Market Analysis (BMA) is performed
by a real estate broker on the basis of his or her knowledge of the current real estate resale activity in the community. Each Analysis will compare your home with other similar,
recently sold homes to attempt to answer the question:

"What will the home sell for in the next three to four months, as is, with usual financing for the area?"

The average value of the BMAs will be the basis for the initial listing price for your home under the Home Sale Assistance Program. The home should be listed for no more than
5% over the average of the two BMAs' most probable sales price. (Following the appraisal process, you will need to adjust your list price so that it is not more than 5% over the
value provided in your Guaranteed Purchase Offer.)  Adherence to the Home Sale Assistance Program requirements, including list price caps, is necessary to receive the home
sale assistance and home purchase benefits outlined in this guide.

Step
3:

Selecting
a
broker
or
agent
to
sell
your
home

You may want to list your home with one of the brokers who provided a BMA, but you are not required to do so. Talk over your broker preferences with your RMC consultant.
If you wish to consider additional brokers, the RMC will provide referrals. You are free to choose a broker or agent you already know, subject to RMC approval. Approval must
be granted before you take any action regarding the price, terms and service requirements of the listing.  In addition, your agent may not be your relative (defined as a parent,
child, spouse, domestic partner, sibling, in-law, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent, or grandchild) as it is a conflict of interest for the Company to reimburse members of a
relocating family for services (commission) connected with the sale of the old home or purchase of a new home.

Step
4:

Listing
your
home
for
sale

After you have chosen a broker or agent, you will be asked to sign a listing agreement. The following "Exclusion Clause" must be included as a signed addendum to your listing
agreement:

"It is understood and agreed that regardless of whether or not an offer is presented by a ready, willing and able buyer:

(1)

(2)

That no commission or compensation is earned by, or is due and payable to, broker until sale of the property has been consummated between seller and buyer,
the deed delivered to the buyer and the purchase price delivered to the seller; and

That the seller reserves the right to sell the property to Altair Global or any other person(s) designated by Altair (individually and collectively a "Named
Prospective Purchaser") at any time upon which this listing agreement shall terminate without obligation by Altair or the parties to this agreement and no
commission or compensation will be due."

The
exclusion
clause
must
be
attached
to
the
listing
agreement
as
a
signed
addendum.
This clause will prevent PG&E from paying the listing broker double commission
when the home is sold.

The
commission
may
not
exceed
6%
without
prior
approval
from
PG&E.
The
term
of
any
listing
agreement
should
not
exceed
90
days.
Your RMC consultant may
recommend a shorter term under certain circumstances.

Establish
a
realistic
list
price
for
the
home.
Your RMC consultant will offer advice on the best listing and selling prices, based on current market data provided by real estate
professionals in the community. You are encouraged to participate in this process by providing relevant data to the brokers chosen to assess value. The advantages of a
competitive listing price will be explained fully by your consultant.

You must complete a home sale disclosure statement. Every home seller has certain legal duties and obligations to a buyer, including full disclosure of all pertinent information
about the condition of the home and its surroundings. If the RMC inadvertently or without proper disclosure information purchases a home ineligible for the Home Sale
Assistance program, and PG&E incurs a loss as a result of your omission or misrepresentation of information, you must repay PG&E any current and future out-of-pocket
expenses, and/or fines or legal judgments paid or to be paid by PG&E with regard to the property.

You
must
not
sign
any
purchase
offers
or
accept
any
earnest
money.
Your
relocation
consultant
will
instruct
you
on
how
to
proceed.

Step
5:

Work
closely
with
the
broker
and
the
RMC

to
locate
a
buyer
for
your
home.

Your RMC consultant will work directly with the real estate broker or agent to monitor progress in marketing your home. The consultant will make constructive suggestions and
note any market activity that might impact the sales strategy. You will be contacted regularly by the consultant to discuss current information and revise the sales strategy as
needed. You are encouraged to carefully evaluate these recommendations, but you are not required to accept them.

Step
6:

Review
any
purchase
offers
on
the
home
with
your
RMC
consultant.

Signing
any
purchase
offer
or
accepting
any
earnest
money
deposits
from
a
buyer
or
broker
prior
to
speaking
with
your
RMC
consultant
will
place
your
Home
Sale
Assistance
benefits
at
risk.

You should contact your RMC consultant immediately when you receive any offer to purchase your home. Your consultant is available by phone toll-free during office hours or
after hours by calling the number listed on his or her business card, and he or she will tell you what to do if the offer is acceptable to you.

If an offer from a buyer is acceptable, the RMC will sign the contracts. The RMC's obligation to you and PG&E is to determine if the buyer is qualified and if the offer is bona
fide before approving the contract.

It
is
important
to
proceed
with
care
in
evaluating
a
purchase
offer
because
some
costs
may
not
be
reimbursable.
If the buyer's purchase offer requires the seller to pay any
concessions or buyer's expenses at closing those costs will be deducted from your equity. The following list provides guidelines for consideration as you negotiate a purchase
offer; however, you should consult your RMC consultant if there is any question about whether a cost will be paid under PG&E's relocation benefit program.

Step
7:

Amended
Value
Sale

Amended Value Sale is a procedure that will be used when you find a buyer for your home. The Amended Value Sale Program consists of two separate, arm's length
transactions:

§

§

The RMC purchases the home from you at the same net price and terms as the bona fide offer that you have received from a buyer. Once the sale to the RMC closes and you
vacate the home, subject to disclosure obligations, you are no longer financially or legally responsible for the home.

The RMC, as the owner of the property, sells the home at the previously offered price to the buyer who made the offer. If something should happen to prevent this second
sale from taking place, you are not affected.

Because the RMC, on behalf of PG&E, is buying your home based on the value of the offer you have received, the RMC must be sure that the offer is bona fide and that the
buyer is ready, willing and able to purchase your home. Your consultant will work closely with you and your broker as you consider any offers to be sure that the terms are
acceptable to the RMC and PG&E.

In order for an offer to be eligible for the Amended Value Sale Program, it must meet certain requirements, including:

§

§

§

The contract of sale from the buyer must specify a closing date that is within 60 days of the contract date.

The contract must not be contingent on the sale of the purchaser's home. It can, however, be contingent on a closing scheduled to occur within thirty (30) days of the contract
date.

The contract must not contain other contingencies, with the exception of inspections and buyer's approval for financing.

If the RMC cannot accept the contract of sale because the buyer is not qualified with a bona fide offer, you must continue to market the home.  If you choose to accept the
contract of sale with the buyer against the recommendation of the RMC, you will be responsible for managing the process as an independent sale, outside of the Home Sale
Assistance Program.  In this case, you will still receive direct reimbursement for reasonable and customary home sale expenses; however, none
of
the
expenses
of
the
transaction
will
be
grossed
up.

Step
8:

Closing
an
Amended
Value
Sale

When an acceptable offer to purchase the home has been received, documents previously sent by the RMC will require immediate attention. The documents will include a
contract of sale between you and the RMC, certain financial information forms and a general warranty deed that will subsequently be used by the RMC to convey title. Your
consultant will offer specific advice as required, but you (and your spouse, if applicable) should plan to execute the documents as soon as possible before a Notary Public and
return them to your RMC consultant. It will not be necessary for you to attend the closing of the sale.

You will receive your equity directly from the RMC when the Contract of Sale documents are signed or the property is vacated, whichever is later. Payment will be by either
check or electronic transfer. You will also receive a detailed equity statement by email, mail, or fax explaining every adjustment to the equity. In general, the equity will be
calculated as follows:

To determine the total "net" cash value of
any transaction on the home under the Home
Sale Assistance Program, first add together:
Then subtract from the above the total of the
following amounts (if any) that are
applicable:

Guide for Calculation of Equity

1.      The purchase price appearing in the RMC's contract of sale, wherein you are the seller and the RMC is the purchaser.
2.      Any amounts you have prepaid for which you are entitled to receive a prorated refund, such as interest and taxes, but excluding

home casualty insurance.

1.      All outstanding indebtedness (mortgages, tax liens, judgments, etc.)
2.      Charges for prorated items such as interest and taxes through the effective date of the contract of sale between you and the

RMC or through the vacate date, whichever is later.

3.      Concessions to which you agreed as the seller.
4.      Costs for deferred maintenance/repairs to be completed before the home can be purchased.
5.      A vacate holdback of $500, refundable to you after you have permanently vacated the property and the RMC has verified

property condition.

Step
9:

Cost
of
Ownership

The sale price in the Contract of Sale between you and the RMC will reflect the cost of ownership of the home (property insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance and interest on
the mortgage) through
the
effective
date
of
the
contract
of
sale
between
you
and
the
RMC
or
the
vacate
date,
whichever
is
later.
The equity statement from the RMC will provide
a detailed accounting of your home sale transaction.

It is acceptable to cancel your property insurance as of your vacate or acceptance date, whichever is later. However, for liability purposes it is recommended that your property
insurance remain in effect until your new policy is in force .
It
is
your
responsibility
to
contact
your
insurance
carrier
to
advise
them
of
cancellation.

Your RMC consultant will advise you when to discontinue making mortgage and other payments. If you have arrangements with any lender for payments to be automatically
deducted from your account, it will be your responsibility to cancel the automatic draft(s) as of your acceptance or vacate date whichever is later. It
is
imperative
you
discuss
with
your
RMC
consultant
when
to
send
this
form
to
your
lender.
If you fail to cancel your automatic draft(s), refunds for overpayments will be delayed until after closing.

Step
10:

Vacating
the
Home

If you vacate prior to closing, your real estate broker will make arrangements to pick up your house keys, warranties, garage door opener controls and other such necessities.
Your consultant will notify you when to transfer utilities to the broker's name, but do not request the utilities be turned off as this will result in reconnect charges. Please be sure
to contact the utility companies to provide your forwarding address for your final bills.

Regardless of whether you vacate before or after closing, it will be necessary to leave the home in cleanly swept condition. In order to avoid paying additional cleaning charges
later, the home must be clean and you must remove all personal property, trash or debris. Cleaning charges will be withheld from the refund of your "vacate holdback" (Step 8,
item 5 in the Guide for Calculation of Equity) if necessary.

Tax
Liability

The majority of expenditures associated with this benefit are not reported as gross earnings; thus no gross-up is necessary provided the home sells under the Amended Value Sale
program. The only exception to this is the expenditures associated with the deed and transfer tax of the property in some states.

Guaranteed
Purchase
Offer

Once your home is listed under the Home Sale Assistance Program, the RMC will guarantee to purchase your home at a price based on objective relocation appraisals. With this
Guaranteed Purchase Offer (GPO), it is possible for you to move with confidence, knowing you may accept the RMC's offer if further marketing under the Home Sale Assistance
Program does not bring an acceptable outside buyer.

Required
Marketing
Period

You are required to market your home under the Home Sale Assistance Program for 60 days before you may accept the Guaranteed Purchase Offer. The required marketing
period begins on the day you list your home for sale under the Home Sale Assistance Program.

Relocation
Appraisals
determine
the
value
of
the
Guaranteed
Purchase
Offer.

When you have begun to market your home under the Home Sale Assistance Program, you will be asked to select appraisers from a list presented by your RMC consultant. The
appraisers will be local, independent appraisers who, once selected, will be hired by the RMC to appraise your home.

The primary intent of PG&E's Home Sale Assistance Program is to assist you in locating a buyer, not to purchase and re-sell your home. Therefore, the appraisers are asked to
objectively evaluate your home in order to estimate the most
probable
selling
price
after
reasonable
market
exposure.
This definition of value differs from a bank or
mortgage appraisal and may also differ from what a specific buyer might be willing to pay for your home. The GPO is provided as a fall-back offer, available to you if you do not
locate a buyer. Through the RMC, PG&E will purchase your home at a price that should enable the RMC to re-sell it within a reasonable amount of time.

You will be thoroughly briefed on the content of the appraisals by your relocation consultant.

The amount of the Guaranteed Purchase Offer will be the average of the two appraisal values. If the lower value of the two appraisals is not within 5% of the higher value, the
RMC will ask you to select another appraiser and will order a third appraisal. When this occurs, the Guaranteed Purchase Offer amount will be the average of the two
closest

values.
(The Brokers' Market Analyses, discussed previously in the "Home Sale Assistance Program" section, will not
be included in the average.)

The appraised value is contingent on the results of any customary and required inspections. Repairs identified through these inspections are your financial responsibility. Repairs
must be completed before equity is released or the cost of repairs will be deducted from your equity. Repairs are subject to re-inspection. Repairs identified will be defects (i.e.,
leaks, faulty furnace or water heater, etc.) and do not include cosmetic items such as painting or replacing carpet, unless those items are required by a lender.

In the process of appraising your home, the appraisers will review comparable sales selected from a multiple listing service or similar directory. You are encouraged to provide
appraisers with a list of recent, comparable sales or other related data that may be useful in assessing the value of your home.

Within seven days of receiving your Guaranteed Purchase Offer, you must reduce your list price to no more than 105% of the GPO amount.  Adherence to the Home Sale
Assistance Program guidelines, including list price caps, is necessary to receive the home sale and home purchase benefits outlined in this guide.

Accepting
the
Guaranteed
Purchase
Offer

You may accept the GPO at the end of the 60-day marketing period, or you may continue to market the home until the end of the acceptance period of the GPO. The acceptance
period of the GPO is 60 days, beginning with the date of the offer (not necessarily the same date as the marketing period begins).

To accept the GPO, execute the contracts and all associated documents (which may differ depending on which state the home is located). Several of the documents will require
the acknowledgment of a Notary Public. All documents must be in the RMC's possession before the end of the 60th day.

The equity payments based on the GPO will be made on the later of either the contract date (when the contract is signed by your relocation consultant) or the date the home is
vacated. Allow five (5) business days after the RMC receives paperwork for payment of the equity. The RMC will deliver the equity check to you by overnight service or wire
the funds directly to the account.

Amended
Value
Sale

If, before accepting your GPO, you receive an offer from an outside buyer that you wish to consider, work with your broker and your RMC consultant to negotiate the offer so
that it may be closed as an Amended Value Sale. (See previous discussion of this procedure in the "Home Sale Assistance Program.")

Home
Sale
Incentive

Should you receive an offer from an outside buyer that is less than the GPO amount, terms may be negotiated for an amended value sales price that is no less than 95% of the
GPO amount. In this case, you may accept this offer and still receive the full amount of the GPO.  You will also receive a bonus of 1% of the negotiated sales price, up to a
maximum of $10,000, less applicable taxes.

Possession
Period

You will be given thirty (30) days from acceptance of the GPO or Amended Value Sale to vacate the property.

Proration
Date

If you accept the GPO, you will be responsible for insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance, principal and interest on the mortgage through
the
date
of
acceptance
of
the
GPO
or
the
date
the
property
is
vacated
whichever
is
later.

Pass-back
of
Gain
or
Loss
on
Sale
to
Employee

Under the terms dictated by the Internal Revenue Service, if the employee accepts the GPO and the property ultimately sells for more than the employee's GPO buyout, a pass-
back of a gain (or a loss) is not permitted. The sales are treated as two separate sales transactions and cannot be related.

Tax
Liability

The majority of expenditures associated with the GPO benefit are not reported as gross earnings; thus no gross-up is necessary provided the home sells under the Guaranteed
Purchase Offer program. The only exception to this is the expenditures associated with the deed and transfer tax of the property in some states.

However, the Home Sale Incentive is reported as additional gross earnings. No tax assistance is available and appropriate taxes will be withheld.

Equity
Advance

The Company may grant you an equity advance in the form of a loan for up to 90% of the equity in your current home when the equity is required to guarantee a contract on a
home in the new location. The advance is made to accommodate your being transferred at the request of the Company, and it is not a mortgage loan. The following guidelines
apply:

§

§

The advance will equal no more than 90% of the equity based on the Guaranteed Purchase Offer.

The total amount of the advance must be used exclusively toward the purchase of a new residence.

§ You must sign a promissory note and agree to repay the advance upon completion of the sale of the former residence. The term of the promissory note is 120 days.

If
you
are
an
executive
of
the
Company
as
defined
by
the
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act,
your
equity
will
be
disbursed
at
the
time
you
accept
the
Guaranteed
Purchase
Offer
and
execute
the
required
paperwork.

Tax
Liability

This benefit is not reported as gross earnings, and no gross-up is necessary.

New
Home
Finding
Assistance

Do
not
contact
any
real
estate
professional
at
the
destination
without
the
guidance
of
your
RMC
consultant.
When you are ready to visit your destination to look for
suitable housing, the RMC must arrange your travel and lodging and take care of many of the details for you.

PG&E will provide you with assistance in searching for your new residence. Specifically:

§

§

§

Before you depart to look for housing in the new location, your RMC consultant will ask you for detailed information concerning your housing preferences, price range and
family requirements.

If you wish to rent, the RMC will arrange for a rental service or a real estate broker to assist you in locating the right place for you.

If you choose to purchase a home, a real estate broker will arrange for house-hunting tours for every day you are in the area. You will be escorted to neighborhoods and
homes of interest to you. Through your broker or agent, you will see homes targeted to meet your goals and needs.

Rental
Assistance

In order to assist employees who intend to rent or lease a home or apartment in the new location, one full day tour with a rental finding company/brokerage will be provided.
Your RMC consultant can assign you to a qualified local company in your destination area to provide you with the following information:

§ General availability of apartments, houses, and condominiums for rent and the range of rental rates

§

Local real estate practices governing such matters as who prepares the lease, the amount of commission if any, and the security deposit required

Home
Search
Trip

You and your spouse/registered domestic partner may take up to two home search trips for a maximum of eight days, seven nights total. Dependent children who will be
relocating to the destination with the family will also be eligible for one home finding trip.

The following conditions apply to travel expense reimbursement:

§ All travel arrangements must be made through the RMC.

§

Itemized receipts are required for reimbursement. Submit the Expense Report to the RMC.

§ Airline reservations should be made seven days in advance. If you wish to drive, you will be reimbursed mileage at the current IRS rate for business travel.

§

§

§

§

Baggage fees are not reimbursable for this trip. You may use your Miscellaneous Allowance to cover baggage fees.

Expenses for transportation to and from the airport, parking, and tolls will be reimbursed in accordance with the Company business travel policy.

Reasonable lodging will be provided for employee and spouse/domestic partner together for the trip.

Expenses for car rental and gas will be reimbursed. Expenses for a GPS or upgrades not standard for the rental car will not be reimbursed.

§ Meals up to $75 per day per adults and children aged 16 and older and $40 per day per child under the age of 16. Costs for alcoholic beverages will not be reimbursed.

§ Do not use your corporate credit cards for relocation expenses. In addition, do not use your company car for activities related to relocation, as the IRS considers such use as

taxable income to you.

Business
Expenses

Should you incur business expenses during the home finding trip, these expenses must be segregated from relocation expenses and submitted to PG&E separately to avoid
relocation tax liability.

Tax
Liability

New Home Finding benefits are reported as additional gross earnings and the amount is grossed up to help offset additional taxes.

Lender
Referral

One of the critical aspects of buying a new home is obtaining mortgage financing. The RMC will provide you with a list of representatives of selected local and national
mortgage companies that will offer loan programs for your use. You are not required to use any of the lenders referred by the RMC, but they typically offer mortgages at
competitive interest rates and reduced fees. Your designated mortgage company will provide details on financing your transaction.

Home
Purchase
Closing
Costs

You are eligible for reimbursement of normal closing costs when you purchase a home at the new location. To receive this benefit you must close the purchase of your new home
within one year of your report date at the destination location. If you choose not to use an Altair preferred broker, you may jeopardize your closing cost benefits .

Closing
Procedures

Your mortgage company will provide details on financing your transaction.

Your consultant will review your closing documents to make certain that the charges are in order, consistent with your negotiated purchase contract and within the limits of
reimbursements that will be paid by PG&E.

All eligible costs will be paid by the RMC at closing so that all you need to provide when you close the purchase of your home is the down payment and any concessions or other
non-eligible costs.

Eligible
Closing
Expenses

Closing costs reimbursement will be equal to actual costs or 2.0% of the new home purchase price, whichever is less.

§ Appraisal fee, if required by lending institution

Tax
Liability

The Closing Cost Benefit is reported as additional gross earnings and the amount is grossed up to help offset additional taxes.

Your belongings will be shipped by one of the RMC's select moving companies.

Household
Goods
Moving

Your consultant will arrange for the RMC's household goods move coordinator to contact you and provide you with details surrounding the movement of your household goods.
The moving company will need sufficient time to properly coordinate your move. A minimum notice of 30 working days is required.  During holidays and summer months, more
lead-time is required.  Packing and loading dates will be arranged with every attempt made to provide these services on the dates you request. However, keep in mind that PG&E
will not authorize or reimburse additional costs of weekend or holiday service. If you request a weekend or holiday move, the overtime charges will be collected directly from
you upon delivery.

Insurance

Replacement cost insurance up to $100,000 is provided at no cost to you. If you require additional coverage in excess of that provided, the cost will be billed to you by the RMC.

Moving
Services

The selected household goods carrier will pack, load, insure, transport, deliver and unpack your normal household goods. There are some limits to this service. Furniture and
boxes will be placed in your home where specified, and the contents of your boxes will be unpacked and placed on the closest flat surface, if requested. Unpacking beyond this
description is considered a settling-in service or maid service and may be obtained from the moving company at an additional cost to you.

Depending on the complexity of services you require, some additional services may be performed by your moving company or a third-party service firm when deemed necessary
by the RMC and within reasonable costs. Such "third-party" services, including crating, will be considered for normal household goods only and will not include service for
items affixed to the property.

It is strongly recommended that you take advantage of the packing services provided by this guide. If you pack yourself, no cost saving is realized and none of the goods that you
pack will be insured.

If you are unavailable for a pick-up or delivery and do not notify movers in advance, any additional charge will be billed to you.

Household
Goods
Storage

Storage of household goods and personal effects in transit will be covered up to 90 days, but
only
if
storage
is
unavoidable
. If storage is required for more than 90 days or if
you need to access any stored items, the charge will be billed to you.

You will be responsible for costs beyond the time period allowed by this guide.

Transportation
of
Automobiles

PG&E will pay for shipping up to two personal automobiles if the move is greater
than
400
miles.
The vehicles must be in working order and must fit on a standard car carrier
or moving van. The value of the vehicles to be moved must exceed the cost of shipment.

If the move is less than 400 miles, you are required to drive the cars you own to the new location or ship them at your own expense. Mileage and tolls via the most commonly
used direct route will be reimbursed at the current IRS rate.

Disconnecting
and
Connecting
Appliances/Utilities

PG&E will cover the cost of disconnecting and connecting normal household appliances or any other article requiring special servicing for safe transportation. Appliances
include washer, dryer, refrigerator, and icemaker. However, the extension of any gas or electric lines or adding service for mismatched appliances (i.e., converting an electric
hook-up for a gas appliance) is excluded.

Special
or
Extraordinary
Shipping
Requirements
Are
Your
Responsibility

Plans should be made in advance for items requiring special or extraordinary handling. These shipping arrangements and the costs will be your responsibility, but call your
household goods move coordinator or your relocation consultant for advice.

PG&E will not pay for charges by the moving company to pick up any furnishings or material at any site other than your primary residence. You will be billed directly for this
additional service.

Important
Information
Concerning
Household
Goods
Shipping

§ Valuables such as jewelry, coin and stamp collections, computer programs, currency, precious metals, gems or semi-precious stones, rare documents, or most other

collectibles should be set aside and transported with you when you travel. Only under certain very specific conditions is the mover responsible for these items. Be certain to
ask the representative of your moving company about transporting valuables when he or she visits your home to inventory your belongings.

§

Firearms may be transported, but must be unloaded, packed separately and inventoried by type of firearm and serial number. The inventory must be included in the
documentation of the move. This is for your protection as well as the protection of the mover. You will be responsible for meeting the licensing or registration requirements,
if any, of the state where you are moving. You cannot ship live ammunition via household goods movers.

§ Accompany the mover through the home as he or she inventories and tags each item to be moved. Plan to check off the items at the destination as well; otherwise, you may

have difficulty with claims settlements should they prove necessary.

§ You or your representative should be present during packing and loading. Do not release the drivers until a complete inspection of the home and property has been

accomplished, since items left behind could result in extra charges to you.

§ Detach items that are to be moved, such as televisions, wall-mounted can openers and coffee makers, pictures, posters, curtain rods, attached bookcases and the like. Unplug

appliances and electrical devices such as stereos and computers; if possible, stow the connecting cords and cables.

§

§

Remove all items from refrigerators. Unplug, defrost, clean and let stand open to dry at least 24 hours in advance of loading.

Items that cannot be moved by your household goods mover:

- Bleach

-

-

Propane tanks or butane tanks

Flammable or combustible items of any kind, including gas and oil in lawn mowers, edgers and other yard or utility equipment

- Open liquids of any kind

-

Frozen foods

- Aerosol cans or paints

§ No mover will accept liability for moving plants. If you choose to allow the mover to move your plants, you do so at your own risk.

Note:
Federal regulations require that plants moved interstate be inspected and certified free of pests and diseases. The states of California, Arizona and Florida are
especially diligent in enforcing their agriculture laws. Taking plants into these states may require considerable extra expense and effort.

§

If you have items in temporary storage, please give the shipper maximum possible advance notice of the date you prefer delivery. Fourteen days is recommended to ensure
the availability of your preferred dates.

§ Keep your utilities on at the old location until at least the day after the scheduled completion of packing and loading.

§

In the event damage occurs during the shipment of your goods, please advise your relocation consultant within 30 days from you final delivery date. All claims must be
submitted within 90 days of delivery date.

Tax
Liability

Household goods moving expenses and storage up to 30 days are excluded from gross earnings and no tax liability is created; therefore, gross-up is not necessary. The cost of
eligible storage beyond 30 days is grossed up.

Temporary
Living
Expenses

If you assume duties at the new location before your new home is available for occupancy, the RMC will arrange for temporary accommodations in corporate housing for up to
six months as long as you are still financially responsible for your former residence. Temporary living must be arranged through the RMC.

Only lodging expenses will be covered, this includes one parking space at the temporary housing unit.

If temporary housing that allows pets is available, you are responsible for pet deposits, related fees, etc.

You are eligible for a rental car for up to 14 days while your personal auto is in transit. The rental car can be arranged through Altair's Travel Department and direct billed to
Altair.

Trips
Home

The Trip Home benefit is intended to provide you (the employee) with one trip back to your former residence so that you can meet with movers and assist your family with the
final move.

You will be eligible for a maximum of two round trips for you, the employee, to return to the departure location OR your spouse/registered domestic partner to visit the
destination location. Only round trip airfare or mileage (the most direct route driving at least 400 miles per day) is eligible for reimbursement for your Trip Home benefit. Items
that will not be reimbursed include; transportation to and from the airport, parking, meals and baggage fees. The Miscellaneous Expense Allowance is intended to cover these
costs.

Tax
Liability

This benefit is reported as additional gross earnings and the amount is grossed up to help offset additional taxes.

Final
Trip

Reimbursement will be provided for reasonable in-transit expenses incurred by you, your spouse/registered domestic partner, and eligible dependents while traveling on the final
trip from the old to the new location.

Eligible expenses include reasonable travel, such as a shuttle or taxi to the airport, lodging and meal expenses. Meals up to $75 per day per adults and children aged 16 and older
and $40 per day per child under the age of 16. Costs for alcoholic beverages will not be reimbursed.

You must work with your RMC consultant to make your travel arrangements. Air transportation (coach class with advance purchase) will be provided if the distance is over 400
miles; otherwise you are required to drive to the new location. Baggage fees for up to two pieces of regular luggage per person will be eligible for reimbursement. You may be
reimbursed for up to $100 in total per person for baggage fees. Any additional baggage fees should be paid for using your Miscellaneous Allowance.

If you drive, you will be reimbursed mileage for up to two automobiles. Mileage reimbursement will be based on the current IRS rate for business travel by the most direct route.
Other expenses for hotel and meal reimbursement will be based on travel of at least 400 miles per day. No reimbursement is provided for the additional cost of side trips or
sightseeing.

Expenses are reimbursable for one night prior to departure, en route, and if you are unable to move directly into your new home upon arrival, one night at the destination.

Do not use your corporate credit cards for relocation expenses. In addition, do not use your company car for activities related to relocation as the IRS considers such use as
taxable income to you.

You must report actual travel expenses on a Relocation Expense Form and submit to the RMC for approval.

Tax
Liability

With the exception of meals and excess mileage in accordance with IRS guidelines, final move expenses are excluded from income and no gross-up is necessary. Meals and
excess mileage payments are reported as additional gross earnings and are grossed up.

Expense
Reporting

In some circumstances, you are required to pay certain relocation expenses and request reimbursement afterward. Such reimbursement requests must be kept separate from other
business expenses and submitted to the RMC, using the Relocation Expense Form.

After submitting the expense report online, the required receipt copies should be submitted to the RMC for approval and processing no
later
than
30
days
after
you
incur
the
expenses.
Failure to submit expenses within this time frame could jeopardize reimbursement, your tax assistance, or both. Reimbursement will be for actual, reasonable costs
only, within the guidelines.

Please
remember:

§ You must include copies of itemized
receipts for all expenses in order to be eligible for reimbursement.

§ You must include a copy of the expense report when you provide your receipts.

§

It is wise to make copies of all reimbursement forms and receipts that you submit for your personal records as well as for income tax purposes.

Regular business/travel expenses must be submitted separately to PG&E on separate expense reports.

Do not use your corporate credit cards for relocation expenses. In addition, you may not use your company car for activities related to relocation, as the IRS considers such use as
taxable income to you.

In addition to other policy provisions regarding the timing of expense reimbursements, any reimbursements of taxable expenses provided pursuant to this program shall be
reimbursed on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred, consistent with requirements in Internal Revenue Code Section
409A, as it may be amended.

The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement is not subject to a multi-year cap.  As a result, expenses eligible for reimbursement during one year do not affect the expenses
eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year.

Tax
Liability
on
Relocation
Expenses

Paid
to
You
or
On
Your
Behalf

Most of the amounts expended by PG&E on your behalf during relocation, whether reimbursed to you or paid directly to the service provider, will be included in your annual
income. The only exceptions are certain household goods moving and final trip expenses, defined by the IRS, which are excluded
from your income. Other than these specific,
limited exclusions, the total of all other relocation payments will appear on your W-2 issued in January of the following year.

PG&E will provide tax assistance for most taxable benefits through a process called "gross-up." The RMC will calculate the amount of gross-up to which you are entitled and
report it to PG&E. PG&E, through the payroll department, will pay additional funds directly to the appropriate tax authority to help offset the tax liability.

Please take note of these important factors pertaining to your gross-up benefits:

§

§

The tax assistance provided by PG&E will be calculated using supplemental federal, state and local rates and will include Social Security and Medicare if applicable.

Certain relocation expenses, which are not grossed up, may be deductible on your individual tax return.

§ Gross-up is provided as a financial benefit, but is not intended to compensate you completely for all tax liabilities.

§ You are responsible for calculating, reporting and paying all personal federal, state and local income taxes for which you are liable. The RMC will send you a detailed gross-
up package that itemizes all relocation expenses for the tax year, including the gross-up payments the Company provides on your behalf. The package is provided for your
information and for use by your tax professional if you use such services.

The
services
of
tax
and
legal
professionals
are
recommended.

RELOCATION
REPAYMENT
AGREEMENT

I hereby acknowledge that I have received and read a summary of the relocation assistance benefit available to me under the Pacific
Gas
&
Electric
Company
(PG&E)
relocation
guide.  I understand the benefit to me of the assistance available and agree to the following:

·

·

·

·

For purposes of this Agreement, the effective date of relocation is the first day I report to my PG&E
work location.

The payment of relocation costs directly to me and to others on my behalf by PG&E
is conditional upon the successful realization of my physical relocation as requested by
PG&E
and upon my remaining in the employment of PG&E
for a period of 24 consecutive months from the effective date of relocation.  If I voluntarily resign or retire my
employment with PG&E
prior to the completion of 24 consecutive months from the effective date of relocation, I will repay PG&E
all relocation costs made to me or to
others on my behalf, in accordance with the following schedule:

From the effective date of relocation, if I resign within:  12 months - I will repay 100%

           24 months - I will repay   50%

If PG&E
pays relocation costs to me or to others on my behalf but I do not physically relocate as requested by PG&E
within the specified timeframe, I understand that
PG&E
will recover up to the full amount of relocation costs provided to me or others on my behalf. I understand that if I voluntarily resign or retire my employment with
PG&E
prior to 24 consecutive months from the effective date of my relocation, in addition to notifying my supervisor, I must notify PG&E's Relocation Services
Department at relocationservices@pge.com .  Relocation Services will inform me of the amount of my relocation repayment obligation within five business days.

I understand that any relocation repayment obligation I have pursuant to this Agreement is due and payable within 30 days of the notification of my resignation or retirement
to relocationservices@pge.com or my last day of work, whichever is earlier.  I understand that if I fail to pay PG&E
the full relocation reimbursement obligation within 30
days of notification of my termination to relocationservices@pge.com , or my final day of work, PG&E
will submit the debt to a collection agency.

· Any dispute regarding any aspect of this Relocation Repayment Agreement, including its validity, interpretation, or any action which would constitute a violation of this
Agreement shall be resolved by an experienced arbitrator, selected by PG&E
and me (collectively "the parties") in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
Association.  The fees of the arbitrator and cost associated with producing a transcript of the proceedings shall be paid in equal shares by the parties.  Any decision rendered
by the Arbitrator, including any remedy awarded, shall be in accordance with the laws of California.

·

·

·

The forum for any dispute submitted to arbitration pursuant to this agreement shall be San Francisco, California.  The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.
Judgment may be entered thereon in accordance with the practice of any court having jurisdiction.

Reimbursement of relocation expenses by PG&E
does not constitute a commitment by PG&E
with respect to the duration of my employment, or alter my at-will
employment status.

If any of the provisions contained in this agreement is held to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, by a court of competent jurisdiction, the entire agreement shall not fail
and all other provisions and obligations of this agreement shall remain valid and enforceable.

By
signing
below,
I
hereby
acknowledge
and
agree
to
the
terms
and
conditions
contained
herein
and
confirm
my
intent
to
relocate.

settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in
relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such person is liable for gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct in duties;

  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be

issued under the Plan shall be seventeen million (17,000,000) less one share for every one share of Stock covered by an award granted under the Prior Plan after December 31,
2013 and prior to the Effective Date.  After the Effective Date, no awards may be granted under the Prior Plan.  Shares of Stock issued hereunder shall consist of authorized but
unissued or reacquired shares of Stock or any combination thereof.  If (i) an outstanding Award for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised
or settled in full, or if shares of Stock acquired pursuant to an Award subject to forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company, the shares of Stock
allocable to the terminated portion of such Award or such forfeited or repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan; or (ii) after December 31,
2013, an outstanding award under the Prior Plan (whenever granted) for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised or settled in full, or if
shares of stock acquired pursuant to an award under the Prior Plan subject to forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company, the shares of stock allocable
to the terminated portion of such award or such forfeited or repurchased shares or stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan (as of December 31, 2013 there were
6,194,819 shares of stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plan).  Shares of Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the Plan (and shall again be
available for issuance under the Plan) with respect to any portion of an Award (or, after December 31, 2013, an award under the Prior Plan) that is settled in cash (other than in
the case of Options or SARs, in which case shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the cash delivered shall be deemed issued pursuant to the Plan).  Upon the
exercise of an SAR (or, after December 31, 2013, exercise of an SAR that was granted under the Prior Plan), the gross number of shares for which the SAR is exercised shall be
deemed issued and shall not again be available for issuance under the Plan.  In the event that (i) any Option or other Award granted hereunder is exercised through the tendering
of shares of Stock (either actually or by attestation) or by the withholding of shares by the Company, or (ii) withholding tax liabilities arising from such Award are satisfied by
the tendering of shares of Stock (either actually or by attestation) or by the withholding of shares by the Company, then in each such case (other than in the case of such shares
tendered or withheld in connection with the exercise of Options or SARs) the shares of Stock so tendered or withheld shall be added to the shares available for grant under the
Plan on a one-for-one basis.  In the event that after December 31, 2013, (i) any option or award under the Prior Plan is exercised through the tendering of shares (either actually
or by attestation) or by the withholding of shares by the Company, or (ii) withholding tax liabilities arising from such options or awards are satisfied by the tendering of shares
(either actually or by attestation) or by the withholding of shares by the Company, then in each such case (other than in the case of such shares tendered or withheld in connection
with the exercise of Options or SARs) the shares so tendered or withheld shall be added to the shares available for grant under the Plan on a one-for-one basis.

4.2              Adjustments
for
Changes
in
Capital
Structure
.
  Subject to any required action by the shareholders of the Company, Section 409A of the Code and Section
162(m) of the Code for Awards intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception thereunder, in the event of any change in the Stock effected
without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of
payment of a dividend or distribution to the shareholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair
Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number and kind of shares subject to the Plan and to any outstanding Awards, in the Award limits
set forth in Section 5.4 , and in the exercise or purchase price per share under any outstanding Award in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under the
Plan.  For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company."
Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.  The Committee in its sole discretion, may
also make such adjustments in the terms of any Award to reflect, or related to, such changes in the capital structure of the Company or distributions as it deems appropriate,
including modification of Performance Goals, Performance Award Formulas and Performance Periods, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code for Awards intended to qualify as
"performance-based compensation" thereunder.  The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be final, binding and conclusive.

4.3              Substitute
Awards
.

To the extent permitted under the rules of the applicable stock exchange on which the Stock is listed, Substitute Awards shall not reduce

the shares of Stock authorized for grant under the Plan, nor shall Shares subject to a Substitute Award be added to the shares of Stock available for Awards under the Plan as
provided above.  Additionally, subject to the rules of the applicable stock exchange on which the Stock is listed, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any
Subsidiary Corporation or with which the Company or any Subsidiary Corporation combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not
adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate,
using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of
common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares authorized for grant under the Plan
(and shares subject to such Awards shall not be added to the shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided in the paragraphs above); provided that Awards using such
available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall
only be made to individuals who were not Employees or Directors prior to such acquisition or combination.

5.              ELIGIBILITY
AND
AWARD
LIMITATIONS
.

5.1              Persons
Eligible
for
Awards.
  Awards may be granted only to Employees, Consultants and Directors (including Non-employee Directors).  For purposes of
the foregoing sentence, "Employees," "Consultants" and "Directors" shall include prospective Employees, prospective Consultants and prospective Directors to whom Awards
are granted in connection with written offers of an employment or other service relationship with the Participating Company Group; provided, however, that no Stock subject to
any such Award shall vest, become exercisable or be issued prior to the date on which such person commences Service.  A Non-employee Director Award may be granted only
to a person who, at the time of grant, is a Non-employee Director.

5.2              Participation.
  Awards other than Non-employee Director Awards are granted solely at the discretion of the Committee.  Eligible persons may be granted

more than one Award.  However , eligibility in accordance with this Section shall not entitle any person to be granted an Award, or, having been granted an Award, to be granted
an additional Award.

5.3              Incentive
Stock
Option
Limitations.

(a)              Persons
Eligible.
  An Incentive Stock Option ("ISO") may be granted only to a person who, on the effective date of grant, is an Employee of the

Company, a Parent Corporation or a Subsidiary Corporation (each being an "
ISO-Qualifying
Corporation
"
).  Any person who is not an Employee of an ISO-Qualifying
Corporation on the effective date of the grant of an Option to such person may be granted only a Nonstatutory Stock Option.  An Incentive Stock Option granted to a prospective
Employee upon the condition that such person become an Employee of an ISO-Qualifying Corporation shall be deemed granted effective on the date such person commences
Service with an ISO-Qualifying Corporation, with an exercise price determined as of such date in accordance with Section 6.1.

(b)              Fair
Market
Value
Limitation.
  To the extent that options designated as Incentive Stock Options (granted under all stock option plans of the

Participating Company Group, including the Plan) become exercisable by a Participant for the first time during any calendar year for stock having a Fair Market Value greater
than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this
Section, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be
determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted.  If the Code is amended to provide for a limitation different from that set forth in this Section, such
different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with respect to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code.  If an
Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section, the Participant may
designate which portion of such Option the Participant is exercising.  In the absence of such designation, the Participant shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock
Option portion of the Option first.  Upon exercise, shares issued pursuant to each such portion shall be separately identified.

5.4              Award
Limits.

(a)              Maximum
Number

Shares
Issuable

aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options shall not exceed the number of shares set forth in the
first sentence of Section 4.1 plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, any shares of Stock that again become
available for issuance pursuant to the remaining provisions of Section 4.1.

(b)              Section
162(m)
Award
Limits.
  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, no Participant may be granted (i) Options or Stock Appreciation
Rights during any calendar year with respect to more than 800,000 shares of Stock in the aggregate, and (ii) during any calendar year one or more Restricted Stock Awards,
Restricted Stock Unit Awards or Performance Share Awards that are intended to comply with the performance-based exception under Code Section 162(m) for more than
1,600,000 shares of Stock in the aggregate; provided that, for this purpose, such limit shall be applied based on the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be earned
under the applicable Award(s).  During any calendar year no Participant may be granted Performance Units or other Awards that are intended to comply with the performance-
based exception under Code Section 162(m) and are denominated in cash under which more than $20,000,000 may be earned in the aggregate.  Each of the limitations in this
section shall be multiplied by two with respect to Awards granted to a Participant during the first calendar year in which the Participant commences employment with the
Company and its Subsidiaries.  If an Award is cancelled, the cancelled Award shall continue to be counted toward the applicable limitation in this Section.

(c)              Non-employee
Director
Award
Limits.
  No Non-employee Director shall be granted Awards (including Non-employee Director Awards) in any

calendar year having an aggregate Grant Date value in excess of $400,000.  For this purpose, Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock Awards, Performance Awards, and other
Awards shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date of the maximum number of shares of Stock or dollars, as applicable, covered thereby and Options and
SARs shall be valued using a Black-Scholes or other accepted valuation model, in each case, using reasonable assumptions.

5.5              Dividends
and
Dividend
Equivalents.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, cash dividends, stock and any other property (other than cash)
distributed as a dividend, a Dividend Equivalent or otherwise with respect to any Award that vests based on achievement of Performance Goals (a) shall either (i) not be paid or
credited or (ii) be accumulated, (b) shall be subject to restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying Award with respect to which such cash, stock or other
property has been distributed and (c) shall be paid after such restrictions and risk of forfeiture lapse in accordance with the terms of the applicable Award Agreement.

6.              TERMS
AND
CONDITIONS
OF
OPTIONS
.

Options shall be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Committee shall from time to

time establish.  No Option or purported Option shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement.  Award
Agreements evidencing Options may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:

6.1              Exercise
Price
.
  The exercise price for each Option shall be established in the discretion of the Committee; provided, however, that (a) the exercise price per

share shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option and (b) no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent
Owner shall have an exercise price per share less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option (whether an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option) may be granted with an exercise price lower than the minimum
exercise price set forth above if such Option is granted as a Substitute Award, except as would result in taxation under Section 409A or loss of ISO status.

6.2              Exercisability
and
Term
of
Options
.
  Options shall be exercisable at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms, conditions,

performance criteria and restrictions as shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option; provided, however, that (a) no
Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of such Option, (b) no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Owner
shall be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years after the effective date of grant of such Option, and (c) no Option granted to a prospective Employee, prospective
Consultant or prospective Director may become exercisable prior to the date on which such person commences Service.  Subject to the foregoing, unless otherwise specified by
the Committee in the grant of an Option, any Option granted hereunder shall terminate ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of the Option, unless earlier terminated in
accordance with its provisions.

6.3              Payment
of
Exercise
Price.

(a)              Forms
of
Consideration
Authorized.
  Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the exercise price for the number of shares of Stock being
purchased pursuant to any Option shall be made (i) in cash, by check or in cash equivalent, (ii) by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock
owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value not less than the exercise price, (iii) by delivery of a properly executed notice of exercise together with irrevocable
instructions to a broker providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares being acquired upon the exercise
of the Option (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System) (a "
Cashless
Exercise
"
), (iv) by delivery of a properly executed notice of exercise electing a Net-Exercise, (v) by such other consideration as may
be approved by the Committee from time to time to the extent permitted by applicable law, or (vi) by any combination thereof.  The Committee may at any time or from time to
time grant Options which do not permit all of the foregoing forms of consideration to be used in payment of the exercise price or which otherwise restrict one or more forms of
consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Award Agreement may provide that if on the last day of the term of an Option the Fair Market Value of one share exceeds the
option price per share, the Participant has not exercised the Option (or a tandem Stock Appreciation Right, if applicable) and the Option has not expired, the Option, to the extent
vested, shall be deemed to have been exercised by the Participant on such day with payment made by withholding shares otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of the
Option.  In such event, the Company shall deliver to the Participant the number of shares for which the Option was deemed exercised, less the number of shares required to be
withheld for the payment of the total purchase price and required withholding taxes; provided, however, any fractional share shall be settled in cash.

(b)              Limitations
on
Forms
of
Consideration.

(i)              Tender
of
Stock.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership,

of shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the
Company's stock.

(ii)              Cashless
Exercise.
  The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company's sole and absolute discretion, to establish,
decline to approve or terminate any program or procedures for the exercise of Options by means of a Cashless Exercise, including with respect to one or more Participants
specified by the Company notwithstanding that such program or procedures may be available to other Participants.

6.4              Effect
of
Termination

Option shall be exercisable after a Participant's termination of Service only during the applicable time periods provided in the Award Agreement.

(b)              Extension
if
Exercise
Prevented
by
Law
.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Committee provides otherwise in the Award Agreement, if the
exercise of an Option within the applicable time periods is prevented by the provisions of Section 15 below, the Option shall remain exercisable until three (3) months (or such
longer period of time as determined by the Committee, in its discretion) after the date the Participant is notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event
no later than the earlier of the Option Expiration Date and the tenth anniversary of the date of grant of the Option.

(c)              Extension
if
Exercise
Prohibited
by
Law
.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that on the last business day of the term of an Option (other

than an Incentive Stock Option) the exercise of the Option is prohibited by applicable law, the term of the Option shall be extended for a period of thirty (30) days following the
end of the legal prohibition.

7.              TERMS
AND
CONDITIONS
OF
NON-EMPLOYEE
DIRECTOR
AWARDS
.

Non-employee Director Awards granted under this Plan shall be automatic and non-discretionary and shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions set

forth in this Section 7.

The grant date for all Non-employee Director awards to be made under this Section 7 shall be the later of (1) the date on which the independent inspector of election
certifies the results of the annual election of directors by shareholders of PG&E Corporation or (2) the date that this Plan becomes effective and grants can be made consistent
with legal requirements; provided, however, that in extraordinary circumstances, the grant shall be delayed until the first business day of the next open trading window period
following certification of the director election results, as determined by the General Counsel of PG&E Corporation (the "Grant Date").

Grants made pursuant to this Section 7, but prior to January 1, 2015, shall be subject to the terms of Section 7 of the Prior Plan as in effect prior to the Effective Date,

provided, however, that such grants shall be deemed made under this Plan.

7.1              Grant
of
Restricted
Stock
Unit.

(a)              Timing and Amount of Grant.  Each person who is a Non-employee Director on the Grant Date shall receive a grant of Restricted Stock Units

with the number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing $140,000 by the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Grant Date (rounded down to the nearest whole
Restricted Stock Unit).  The Restricted Stock Units awarded to a Non-employee Director shall be credited to the director's Restricted Stock Unit account.  Each Restricted Stock
Unit awarded to a Non-employee Director in accordance with this Section 7.1(a) shall be deemed to be equal to one (1) (or fraction thereof) share of Stock on the Grant Date, and
the value of the Restricted Stock Unit shall thereafter fluctuate in value in accordance with the Fair Market Value of the Stock.  No person shall receive more than one grant of
Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Section 7.1(a) during any calendar year.

(b)              Dividend
Rights
.  Each Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Unit account shall be credited quarterly on each dividend payment date
with additional shares of Restricted Stock Units (including fractions computed to three decimal places) determined by dividing (1) the amount of cash dividends paid on such
date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Stock Units previously credited to the account by (2) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on
such date.  Such additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time as the Restricted
Stock Units originally subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award.

(c)              Settlement
of
Restricted
Stock
Units
.  Restricted Stock Units credited to a Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Unit account shall, to

the extent vested, be settled in a lump sum by the issuance of an equal number of shares of Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, upon the earliest of (i) the first
anniversary of the Grant Date (normal vesting date), (ii) the Non-employee Director's death, (iii) the Non-employee Director's Disability (within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code), or (iv) the Non-employee Director's Separation from Service following a Change in Control.  However, commencing with Restricted Stock Units having a Grant Date
in 2015, a Non-employee Director may irrevocably elect, no later than December 31 of the calendar year prior to the Grant Date of the Restricted Stock Units (or such later time
permitted by Section 409A) to have the Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Unit account settled in (1) a series of 10 approximately equal annual installments (which shall
be separate payments for purposes of Section 409A) commencing in January of any year following the normal vesting date, or (2) a lump sum in January of any future year
following the normal vesting date.  In the event that the Non-employee Director elects settlement of the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence, the Restricted Stock Units shall be earlier settled in a lump sum, to the extent vested, upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in Section 7.1(c)(ii) through
7.1(c)(iv) prior to the elected settlement date (or commencement thereof in the case of settlement in 10 equal annual installments).  In the event that a Non-employee Director
elects to have the Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Unit account settled in a series of 10 approximately equal annual installments commencing in January of any year
following the normal vesting date and one of the events set forth in Section 7.1(c)(ii) through 7.1(c)(iv) occurs after commencement of such installments but prior to full
settlement of the Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Units, then any remaining unsettled Restricted Stock Units will be settled in a lump sum upon the occurrence of the
applicable event but only to the extent that such acceleration would not result in the imposition of taxation under Section 409A.

7.2              Effect
of
Termination
of
Service
as
a
Non-employee
Director.

(a)              Forfeiture
of
Award
.
  If the Non-employee Director has a Separation from Service prior to the normal vesting date, all Restricted Stock Units

credited to the Participant's account that have not vested in accordance with Section 7.2(b) or 7.3 shall be forfeited to the Company and from and after the date of such Separation
from Service, and the Participant shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto; provided, however, that if the Non-employee Director Separates from Service due to a
pending Disability determination, such forfeiture shall not occur until a finding that such Disability has not occurred.

(b)              Death
or
Disability
.  If the Non-employee Director becomes "disabled," within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code or in the event of the Non-

employee Director's death, all Restricted Stock Units credited to the Non-employee Director's account shall immediately vest and become payable, in accordance with Section
7.1(c), to the Participant (or the Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the rights to the Restricted Stock Units by reason of the Participant's death) in the
form of a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to the Restricted Stock Unit account, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

(c)              Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.1(c) above, the Board, in its sole discretion, may amend this Section 7 or establish different terms and

in
Control

Non-employee
Director

resignation), following the occurrence of a Change in Control, all Restricted Stock Units shall immediately vest but shall not be settled until such time set forth in Section 7.1(c)
occurs.

7.4              Other
Awards

Non-employee

employee Directors shall be eligible to receive all types of Awards under the Plan in addition to or instead of Non-employee Director Awards, as may be determined by the
Board.

Committee shall from time to time establish.  No SAR or purported SAR shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award
Agreement.  Award Agreements evidencing SARs may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms
and conditions:

8.1              Types

Price.
  The exercise price for each SAR shall be established in the discretion of the Committee; provided, however, that (other than in connection

with Substitute Awards granted in accordance with Code Section 424(a)): (a) the exercise price per share subject to a Tandem SAR shall be the exercise price per share under the
related Option and (b) the exercise price per share subject to a Freestanding SAR shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of
the SAR.

8.3              Exercisability
and
Term
of
SARs.

(a)              Tandem

  Tandem SARs shall be exercisable only at the time and to the extent, and only to the extent, that the related Option is exercisable,
subject to such provisions as the Committee may specify where the Tandem SAR is granted with respect to less than the full number of shares of Stock subject to the related
Option.

(b)              Freestanding
SARs.
  Freestanding SARs shall be exercisable at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms,

conditions, performance criteria and restrictions as shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR; provided, however, that
no Freestanding SAR shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of such SAR.

(c)              Extension
if
Exercise

8.4              Deemed
Exercise
of
SARs.
  An Award Agreement may provide that if on the last day of the term of an SAR the Fair Market Value of one share exceeds the

grant price per share of the Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant has not exercised the SAR or the tandem Option (if applicable), and the SAR has not otherwise expired, the
SAR, to the extent then vested, shall be deemed to have been exercised by the Participant on such day.  In such event, the Company shall make payment to the Participant in
accordance with this Section, reduced by the number of shares (or cash) required for withholding taxes; any fractional share shall be settled in cash.

8.5              Effect
of
Termination
of
Service.

described in Section 10.4 or other performance conditions established by the Committee.  If either the grant of a Restricted Stock Award or the lapsing of the Restriction Period
is to be contingent upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals, the Committee shall follow procedures substantially equivalent to those set forth in Sections 10.3
through 10.5(a) for Awards intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception under Section 162(m) of the Code.

right to vote such shares and to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares.  However, in the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of

right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company.

the Committee in its sole discretion.

10.1              Types

  Performance Awards may be in the form of either Performance Shares or Performance Units.  Each Award

Performance
Shares
and
Performance

  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in granting a Performance Award, each

Performance Share shall have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, on the effective date of
grant of the Performance Share.  Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value determined by the Committee.  The final value payable to the Participant in settlement of a
Performance Award determined on the basis of the applicable Performance Award Formula will depend on the extent to which Performance Goals established by the Committee
are attained within the applicable Performance Period established by the Committee.

10.3              Establishment

compliance with the requirements under Section 162(m) with respect to "performance-based compensation" is desired, the Committee shall establish the Performance Goal(s)
and Performance Award Formula applicable to each Performance Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date ninety (90) days after the commencement of the applicable
Performance Period or (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and, in any event, at a time when the outcome of the Performance Goals remains
substantially uncertain.  Once established, the Performance Goals and Performance Award Formula for Awards intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based
compensation" exception under Section 162(m) shall not be changed during the Performance Period, except as would result in the exercise of negative discretion by the
Committee to reduce the amount of the Award otherwise payable as permitted under Section 162(m).  The Company shall notify each Participant granted a Performance Award
of the terms of such Award, including the Performance Period, Performance Goal(s) and Performance Award Formula.

10.4              Measurement
of
Performance
Goals.

"
), subject to the following:

(a)              Performance
Measures.
  Performance Measures shall be calculated with respect to the Company and/or each Subsidiary Corporation and/or such

division or other business unit as may be selected by the Committee, or may be based upon performance relative to performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any
of the indicators of performance relative to performance of other companies.  Performance Measures may be based upon one or more of the following objectively defined and
non-discretionary business criteria and any other objectively verifiable and non-discretionary adjustments permitted and pre-established by the Committee in accordance with
Section 162(m), as determined by the Committee:  (i) sales revenue; (ii) gross margin; (iii) operating margin; (iv) operating income; (v) pre-tax profit; (vi) earnings before

value of a Performance Award determined under the applicable Performance Award Formula by the level attained during the applicable Performance Period.  A Performance
Target may be stated as an absolute value or as a value determined relative to a standard selected by the Committee.

10.5              Settlement
of
Performance
Awards.

(a)              Determination
of
Final
Value.
  As soon as practicable, but no later than the 15th day of the third month following the completion of the Performance

Period applicable to a Performance Award (or such shorter period set forth in an Award Agreement), the Committee shall certify in writing the extent to which the applicable
Performance Goals have been attained and the resulting final value of the Award earned by the Participant and to be paid upon its settlement in accordance with the applicable

Performance Award Formula no later than the 15 th day of the third month following the completion of such Performance Period (or such shorter period set forth in an Award
Agreement).

(b)              Discretionary
Adjustment
of

thereafter, provide for the positive or negative adjustment of the Performance Award Formula applicable to a Performance Award that is not intended to constitute "qualified
performance-based compensation" to a "covered employee" within the meaning of Section 162(m) (a "
Covered
Employee
"
) to reflect such Participant's individual performance
in his or her position with the Company or such other factors as the Committee may determine.  With respect to a Performance Award intended to constitute qualified
performance-based compensation to a Covered Employee, the Committee shall have the discretion to reduce (but not increase) some or all of the value of the Performance Award
that would otherwise be paid to the Covered Employee upon its settlement notwithstanding the attainment of any Performance Goal and the resulting value of the Performance
Award determined in accordance with the Performance Award Formula.

(c)              Payment

Settlement
of

Sections 10.5(a) and (b) but, in any case, no later than the 15th day of the third month following completion of the Performance Period applicable to a Performance Award (or
such shorter period set forth in an Award Agreement), payment shall be made to each eligible Participant (or such Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired
the right to receive such payment by reason of the Participant's death) of the final value of the Participant's Performance Award.  Payment of such amount shall be made in cash,
shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee.

10.6              Voting
Rights,
Dividend
Equivalent
Rights
and
Distributions.
  Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by
Performance Share Awards until the date of the issuance of such shares, if any (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
transfer agent of the Company).  However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Performance Share Award that the Participant
shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a record date prior to the date on which the Performance Shares
are settled or forfeited.  Such Dividend Equivalents, if any, shall be credited to the Participant in the form of additional whole Performance Shares as of the date of payment of
such cash dividends on Stock.  The number of additional Performance Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number) to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the
amount of cash dividends paid on such date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Performance Shares previously credited to the Participant by (b) the
Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.  Dividend Equivalents credited in connection with Performance Shares shall be subject to Section 5.5 of the Plan.  Settlement
of Dividend Equivalents may be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee, and may be paid on the same basis as settlement of the
related Performance Share as provided in Section 10.5.  Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid with respect to Performance Units.  In the event of an adjustment described in
Section 4.2, the adjusted Performance Share Award shall be immediately subject to the same Performance Goals as are applicable to the Award.

the effect of a Participant's termination of Service on the Performance Award shall be as follows:

(a)              Death
or
Disability.
  If the Participant's Service terminates because of the death or Disability of the Participant before the completion of the

Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, the final value of the Participant's Performance Award shall be determined by the extent to which the applicable
Performance Goals have been attained with respect to the entire Performance Period and shall be prorated based on the number of months of the Participant's Service during the
Performance Period.  Payment shall be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted by Section 10.5.

(b)              Other
Termination
of
Service.
  If the Participant's Service terminates for any reason except death or Disability before the completion of the

Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, such Award shall be forfeited in its entirety; provided, however, that in the event of termination of the Participant's
Service for other reasons, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may waive the automatic forfeiture of all or any portion of any such Award, to the extent consistent with the
preservation of the tax deductibility of awards pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.

equivalent to those set forth in Sections 10.3 through 10.5(a) for Awards intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception under Section
162(m).

shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.  In the event of an adjustment as described in Section 4.2, the

vested or otherwise to be settled on such date, subject to the withholding of applicable taxes, provided that Restricted Stock Units may be settled in cash, shares of Stock, or a

Committee one or more Awards of Stock Units with respect to such numbers of shares of Stock as determined in accordance with the rules of the program established by the
Committee and having such other terms and conditions as established by the Committee.

additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of
the Award.

(ii)              Settlement

the time of such election a settlement date with respect to such Award in accordance with rules established by the Committee.  Except as otherwise set forth in the applicable

be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish.

IN
CONTROL
.

14.1              Effect
of
Change
in
Control
.
  Except as set forth in an applicable Award Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing,
successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror "
), may, without the consent of any Participant, either assume
or continue the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Awards or substitute for such Awards substantially equivalent Awards covering the Acquiror's stock.  Except
as set forth in an applicable Award Agreement, any such Awards which are neither assumed, continued, or substituted by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control
nor exercised (if applicable) as of the Change in Control shall, contingent on the Change in Control, become fully vested, and Options and SARs become exercisable
immediately prior to the Change in Control.  Except as set forth in an applicable Award Agreement, Awards which are assumed or continued in connection with a Change in
Control shall be subject to such additional accelerated vesting and/or exercisability, or lapse of restrictions in connection with the Participant's termination of Service in
connection with the Change in Control as the Committee or Board may determine, if any.

respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the Award or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable pursuant to the Award may be issued in accordance
with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having
jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of
any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to issuance of any Stock, the
Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to
make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fair Market Value of any shares of
Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates to the
extent required to avoid adverse accounting or other consequences to the Company or Participant.

the Committee in its discretion at the time the Award is granted.  The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such
right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company.  Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing
such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock
acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.

18.2              Provision
of
Information.
  Each Participant shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made

available to the Company's common shareholders.

18.3              Rights
as
Employee,
Consultant
or
Director.
  No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or,

having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant.  Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer on any Participant a right to remain an
Employee, Consultant or Director or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the Participant's Service at any time.  To the extent that
an Employee of a Participating Company other than the Company receives an Award under the Plan, that Award shall in no event be understood or interpreted to mean that the
Company is the Employee's employer or that the Employee has an employment relationship with the Company.  A Participant's rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with
any Award is derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit the individual to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award.  By
accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant expressly acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional
Awards.  Any Award granted hereunder is not intended to be compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of a Participant's normal or expected compensation, and in
no way represents any portion of a Participant's salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other
purpose.  The Company and its Parent Corporations and Subsidiary Corporations and Affiliates reserve the right to terminate the Service of any person at any time, and for any
reason, subject to applicable laws and such person's written employee agreement (if any), and such terminated person shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any claim to
damages or specific performance for breach of contract or dismissal, compensation for loss of office, tort or otherwise with respect to the Plan or any outstanding Award that is
forfeited and/or is terminated by its terms or to any future Award.

18.4              Rights
as
a
Shareholder.
  A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the date of the issuance of

such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  No adjustment shall be made for
dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in another provision of the Plan.

18.5              Fractional
Shares.
  The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise or settlement of any Award.

18.6              Severability
.  If any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

18.7              Beneficiary
Designation.
  Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary who is to

receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit.  Each
designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in
writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime.  If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such
designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse.  If a Participant dies without an effective designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the
Participant's death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant's legal representative.

18.8              Unfunded
Obligation.
  Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company.  Any amounts payable to Participants pursuant to the

Plan shall be unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  No

Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations.
The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations
hereunder.  Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the
Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's creditors in any assets of
any Participating Company.  The Participants shall have no claim against any Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or
reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.  Each Participating Company shall be responsible for making benefit payments pursuant to the Plan on behalf of its
Participants or for reimbursing the Company for the cost of such payments, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion.  In the event the respective Participating
Company fails to make such payment or reimbursement, a Participant's (or other individual's) sole recourse shall be against the respective Participating Company, and not against
the Company.  A Participant's acceptance of an Award pursuant to the Plan shall constitute agreement with this provision.

18.9              Choice
of
Law.
  Except to the extent governed by applicable federal law, the validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Plan and each

Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law rules.

18.10              Section
409A
of
the
Code.
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to the extent (i) any Award payable in connection with a

Participant's Separation from Service constitutes deferred compensation subject to (and not exempt from) Section 409A of the Code and (ii) the Participant is deemed at the time
of such separation to be a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder, then payment shall not be made or commence until the
earlier of (i) six (6)-months after such Separation from Service or (ii) the date of the Participant's death following such Separation from Service; provided, however, that such
delay shall only be effected to the extent required to avoid adverse tax treatment to the Participant, including (without limitation) the additional twenty percent (20%) tax for
which the Participant would otherwise be liable under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code in the absence of such delay.  Upon the expiration of the applicable delay period, any
payment which would have otherwise been paid during that period (whether in a single sum or in installments) in the absence of this paragraph shall be paid to the Participant or
the Participant's beneficiary in one lump sum on the first business day immediately following such delay and any undelayed payments will be paid in accordance with their
normal terms.

18.11              Restrictions
on
Transfer
.  No Award and no shares of Stock that have not been issued or as to which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral
period has not lapsed, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of decent and distribution, and such Award may be
exercised during the life of the Participant only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by
the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, an Award shall be assignable or transferrable to a "family member" or other permitted
transferee to the extent covered under Form S-8 Registration Statement under the Securities Act.
