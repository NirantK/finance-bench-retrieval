Item 1.    Business

General

Verizon  Communications  Inc.  (the  Company)  is  a  holding  company  that,  acting  through  its  subsidiaries  (together  with  the
Company,  collectively,  Verizon),  is  one  of  the  world’s  leading  providers  of  communications,  technology,  information  and
entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we
offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand
for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.

Our  principal  executive  offices  are  located  at  1095  Avenue  of  the  Americas,  New  York,  New  York  10036  (telephone  number
212-395-1000).

We  have  two  reportable  segments  that  we  operate  and  manage  as  strategic  business  units  -  Verizon  Consumer  Group
(Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business).

Verizon Consumer Group

Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless
services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand,
TracFone  Wireless,  Inc.  (TracFone)  brands  and  through  wholesale  and  other  arrangements.  We  also  provide  fixed  wireless
access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and
over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.

In  2022,  the  Consumer  segment’s  revenues  were  $103.5  billion,  representing  approximately  76%  of  Verizon’s  consolidated
revenues. As  of  December  31,  2022,  Consumer  had  approximately  115  million  wireless  retail  connections,  of  which  80%  are
postpaid connections (including FWA). In addition, at December 31, 2022 Consumer had approximately 8 million total broadband
connections (which includes Fios internet, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and FWA connections), and approximately 3 million Fios
video connections.

Verizon Business Group

Our  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  data,  video  and
conferencing  services,  corporate  networking  solutions,  security  and  managed  network  services,  local  and  long  distance  voice
services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband
through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and
wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world.

In  2022,  the  Business  segment's  revenues  were  $31.1  billion,  representing  approximately  23%  of  Verizon’s  consolidated
revenues.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  Business  had  approximately  29  million  wireless  retail  postpaid  connections  and
approximately 1 million total broadband connections (which includes Fios internet, DSL and FWA connections).

Additional  discussion  of  our  reportable  segments  is  included  in  Item  7.  under  the  headings  "Management’s  Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" and - "Segment Results of Operations" and in Note 13 to
the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries.

Service and Product Offerings

Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers
that  purchase  wireless  network  access  from  us  on  a  wholesale  basis.  Our  Business  segment’s  wireless  and  wireline  products
and  services  are  organized  by  the  primary  customer  groups  targeted  by  these  offerings: Small  and  Medium  Business,  Global
Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale.

Wireless

We offer wireless services and equipment to both Consumer customers and Business customers.

Wireless Services

Our  Consumer  and  Business  segments  provide  a  wide  variety  of  wireless  services  accessible  on  a  broad  range  of  devices.
Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily
represent retail customers that are directly served and managed by Verizon and use Verizon branded services. A single account
may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                4

advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only
to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in
advance. As of December 31, 2022, we had 92 million postpaid connections, including FWA, and 23 million prepaid connections,
representing approximately 80% and 20% of our Consumer wireless retail connections, respectively.

Access  to  the  internet  is  available  on  all  smartphones  and  nearly  all  basic  phones.  In  addition,  our  customers  can  access  the
internet at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that are either wireless-enabled or that are used in conjunction
with separate dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection.

Historically,  customers  on  our  fixed-term  service  plans  paid  higher  access  fees  for  their  wireless  service  in  exchange  for  the
ability  to  purchase  their  wireless  devices  at  subsidized  prices.  We  no  longer  offer  Consumer  customers  new  fixed-term,
subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers.

We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE wireless networks to our Consumer and Business customers. FWA
enables fixed broadband access using radio frequencies instead of cables and can be used to connect homes and businesses to
the internet. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1.5 million FWA broadband connections.

Wireless Equipment

Consumer  and  Business  offer  several  categories  of  wireless  equipment  to  customers,  including  a  variety  of  smartphones  and
other  handsets,  wireless-enabled  internet  devices,  such  as  tablets,  and  other  wireless-enabled  connected  devices,  such  as
smart watches. We permit customers to acquire equipment from us using device payment plans, which permit the customer to
pay for the device in installments over time.

Verizon Consumer Group

In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity
solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. Consumer
also provides non-connectivity services including device protection, cloud storage, and other products.

Residential Fixed Services. We provide residential fixed connectivity solutions to customers over our 100% fiber-optic network
through our Verizon Fios product portfolio, and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.
In  addition,  our  Long-Term  Evolution  (LTE)  Home  fixed  wireless  access  internet  service  is  available  in  parts  of  all  50  states
across the U.S.

We  offer  residential  fixed  services  tailored  to  the  needs  of  our  customers.  Depending  on  those  needs  at  a  particular  time,  our
services may include features related to, among other things: internet access at different speed tiers using fiber-optic, copper or
wireless  technology;  video  services  that  may  feature  a  variety  of  channel  options,  video  on  demand  products,  cloud-based
services and digital video recording capabilities; over-the-top video services; voice services; and other home solutions.

Network Access Services. We sell network access to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) on a wholesale basis, who in
turn resell wireless service under their own brand(s) to consumers.

Verizon Business Group

In  addition  to  the  wireless  services  and  equipment  discussed  above,  our  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline
communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security
and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and
products.

Small and Medium Business

Small  and  Medium  Business  offers  wireless  services  and  equipment,  conferencing  services,  tailored  voice  and  networking
products,  Fios  services,  Internet  Protocol  (IP)  networking,  advanced  voice  solutions  and  security  and  managed  information
technology (IT) services to our U.S.-based small and medium businesses that do not meet the requirements to be categorized as
Global  Enterprise,  as  described  below.  In  2022,  Small  and  Medium  Business  revenues  were  $12.6  billion,  representing
approximately 41% of Business’s total revenues.

In  addition  to  the  wireless  services  and  equipment  discussed  above,  Small  and  Medium  Business  provides  fixed  connectivity
solutions  comparable  to  the  residential  fixed  services  provided  by  Consumer,  as  well  as  business  services  and  connectivity
similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case with features and pricing designed to address the
needs of small and medium businesses.

Global Enterprise

Global  Enterprise  offers  services  to  large  businesses,  which  are  identified  based  on  their  size  and  volume  of  business  with
Verizon,  as  well  as  non-U.S.  public  sector  customers.  In  2022,  Global  Enterprise  revenues  were  $9.7  billion,  representing
approximately 31% of Business’s total revenues.

local,  long  distance,  and  wireless  carriers  that  use  our  facilities  to  provide  services  to  their  customers.  In  2022,  Wholesale
revenues  were  $2.6  billion,  representing  approximately  8%  of  Business’s  total  revenues. A  portion  of  Wholesale  revenues  are
generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Wholesale's services include:

•  Data  services.  We  offer  a  portfolio  of  data  services  to  enhance  our  Wholesale  customers’  networks  and  provide

connections to their end users and subscribers.

•

and globally utilizing our time-division multiplexing and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks.

Local services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some
of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation,
resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations.

Distribution

We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services
to Consumer and Business customers.

Our  direct  channel,  including  our  company-operated  stores,  is  a  core  component  of  our  distribution  strategy.  Our  sales  and
service centers and business direct sales teams also represent significant distribution channels for our services. In addition, we
have a robust digital channel and omni-channel as a part of the customer experience in order to offer choice and convenience.

Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline products and services at retail locations throughout the
U.S., as well as through the internet. The majority of these sales are made under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                6

also  have  relationships  with  high-profile  national  retailers  that  sell  our  wireless  and  wireline  products  and  services,  as  well  as
convenience store chains that sell our wireless prepaid products and services.

In  addition  to  our  direct  channel,  our  Business  segment  has  additional  distribution  channels  that  include  business  solution
fulfillment  provided  by  resellers,  non-stocked  device  fulfillment  performed  by  distributors  and  integrated  mobility  services
provided by system integrators and resellers.

Global Network and Technology

Our global network architecture is used by Consumer and Business. Our network technology platforms include both wireless and
wireline technologies.

Network Evolution

We  are  transforming  the  architecture  of  our  networks  into  our  Intelligent  Edge  Network,  providing  improved  efficiency  and
virtualization,  increased  automation  and  opportunities  for  edge  computing  services  that  will  support  our  fiber-based  and  radio
access  network  technologies.  We  expect  that  this  new  architecture  will  simplify  operations  by  eliminating  legacy  network
elements,  speed  the  deployment  of  fifth-generation  (5G)  wireless  technology  and  create  new  opportunities  in  the  business
market in a cost-efficient manner. As a part of our evolution, we retired our third-generation (3G) network in 2022. As a result,
approximately 909 thousand wireless retail postpaid connections, including 392 thousand wireless postpaid phone connections,
and 237 thousand retail prepaid connections, were removed from the customer base.

5G

Over  the  past  several  years,  we  have  been  leading  the  development  of  5G  wireless  technology  industry  standards  and  the
ecosystems  for  fixed  and  mobile  5G  wireless  services.  5G  technology  enables  higher  throughput  and  lower  latency  than  the
fourth-generation  (4G)  LTE  technology  and  allows  our  networks  to  handle  more  traffic  as  the  number  of  internet-connected
devices grows.

We  provide  5G  wireless  service  utilizing  millimeter  wave  spectrum  and  other  spectrum  bands,  some  of  which  use  dynamic
spectrum sharing (DSS) technology. In January 2022, we began deploying C-Band spectrum, which has been built out to cover
approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We expect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across
the  continental  U.S.  as  more  and  more  of  the  spectrum  becomes  available  for  our  use.  Our  FWA  broadband  service  also
leverages the 5G network and our expanding C-Band footprint, in addition to our 4G FWA offering.

4G LTE

The wireless network technology platform that carries the majority of our wireless traffic is 4G LTE. As of December 31, 2022, our
4G LTE network covers approximately 328 million POPs, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners.
Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each
carrier’s network assets with our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 Megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services
(AWS) spectrum. LTE Home Internet, our home broadband internet service leverages the Verizon 4G LTE network.

Wireless Network Reliability and Build-Out

We consider the reliability, speed, capacity and coverage of our wireless network to be key factors for our continued success. We
believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services.
As we design and deploy our network, we focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables, delivering on
our advertised throughput speeds, and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being
dropped.  We  utilize  three  strategies  to  maintain  the  quality  of  our  network:  increasing  the  density  of  our  network  elements,
deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting additional wireless spectrum into service.

We  have  been  densifying  our  network  by  utilizing  small  cell  technology,  in-building  solutions  and  distributed  antenna  systems.
Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for
IoT  products  and  services  on  our  4G  LTE  and  5G  networks.  We  are  also  utilizing  existing  network  capabilities  to  handle
increased  traffic  without  interrupting  the  quality  of  the  customer  experience.  We  continue  to  deploy  advanced  technologies  to
increase both network capacity and data rates.

In order to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must secure rights to a large number
of sites and obtain zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for our macro and small cells, in-building systems
and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety
of  vendors  that  supply  various  products  and  services  that  support  our  wireless  network  operations.  We  utilize  tower  site
management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites.

Our networks in the U.S. include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to
our customers. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every
macro cell. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a

   7

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

fleet  of  portable  backup  generators  that  can  be  deployed  if  needed.  We  further  enhance  reliability  by  using  a  fully  redundant
Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations.

In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our
customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a
variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service
providers outside the U.S.

Fios

Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that
demand will continue to grow. We expect that the continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the
proliferation  of  IP  devices  in  the  home  will  continue  to  drive  new  network  requirements  for  increased  data  speeds  and
throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these
demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner.

While  deployed  initially  as  a  consumer  broadband  network,  our  PON  infrastructure  is  also  experiencing  more  widespread
application in the Business segment, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services.

Global IP

Verizon  owns  and  operates  one  of  the  largest  global  fiber-optic  networks  in  the  world,  providing  connectivity  to  Business
customers in more than 180 countries. Our global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that enable and
support international operations.

Global  business  is  rapidly  evolving  to  an  "everything-as-a-service"  model  in  which  Business  customers  seek  cloud-based,
converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. We are continuing to deploy packet
optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand.

Spectrum

The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice, video and data communications services. We
are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz
band,  also  known  as  cellular  spectrum,  the  1800-1900  MHz  band,  also  known  as  Personal  Communication  Services  (PCS)
spectrum,  portions  of  the  700  MHz  upper  C  block,  AWS  1  and  3  spectrum  in  the  1700  and  2100  MHz  bands  in  areas  that
collectively cover nearly all of the population of the U.S., and 3700-3900 MHz, also known as C-Band. We have also deployed
4G  technologies  in  3.5  Gigahertz  (GHz)  shared  spectrum,  using  LTE/Citizens  Broadband  Radio  Service,  and  in  5  GHz
unlicensed spectrum, using LTE/Licensed Assisted Access. All of this spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum.
We are using our low and mid-band spectrum to provide 4G LTE and 5G wireless services. As of December 31, 2022, we retired
our  3G  service.  We  are  increasingly  reallocating  spectrum  previously  used  for  3G  service  to  provide  4G  LTE  service,  and  we
completed that transition where needed at the end of 2022. We are also utilizing additional low and mid-band spectrum for 5G
through  DSS  to  complement  both  our  C-Band  and  our  spectrum  licenses  in  the  28  and  39  GHz  band,  collectively  called
millimeter wave spectrum.

Millimeter wave spectrum is being used in conjunction with low and mid-band spectrum for our 5G technology deployment. We
own millimeter wave spectrum predominantly in the 28 GHz and 37/39 GHz bands. Millimeter wave spectrum is currently being
used  to  increase  capacity  for  mobile  and  fixed  wireless  services  in  areas  of  high  demand.  We  anticipate  that  demand  will
continue  to  increase  over  time,  driven  by  growth  in  customer  connections  and  the  increased  usage  of  wireless  broadband
services  that  use  more  bandwidth  and  require  faster  rates  of  speed,  as  well  as  the  wider  deployment  of  5G  mobile  and  fixed
services. We expect to meet the demand for 4G and 5G spectrum needs with our existing spectrum assets. If demand continues
to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet that demand by acquiring licenses
or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum
auctions occur.

We  use  low  and  mid-band  spectrum  and  DSS  technology,  to  allow  5G  service  to  run  simultaneously  with  4G  LTE  on  multiple
spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s millimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-
enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum bands where this network is available. This allows us to
more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4G and 5G customers.

From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap
transactions.  We  expect  to  continue  to  pursue  similar  opportunities  to  trade  spectrum  licenses  in  order  to  meet  capacity  and
expansion  needs  in  the  future.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  entered  into  intra-market  spectrum  swaps  designed  to  increase  the
amount  of  contiguous  spectrum  within  frequency  bands  in  a  specific  market.  Contiguous  spectrum  improves  network
performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.

Competition and Related Trends

The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has
eliminated  many  of  the  traditional  distinctions  among  wireless,  cable,  internet  and  local  and  long  distance  communication
services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional
participants seek increased market share.

With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers,
including AT&T  Inc.  and  T-Mobile  US,  Inc.,  as  well  as  various  regional  wireless  service  providers.  We  also  compete  for  retail
activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their
customers.  Resellers  include  cable  companies,  such  as  Comcast  Corporation  and  Charter  Communications,  Inc.,  and  others.
Competition remains intense as a result of various factors, including high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market,
increased  network  investment  by  our  competitors,  the  development  and  deployment  of  new  technologies,  including  5G,  the
introduction  of  new  products  and  services,  offerings  that  include  additional  bundled  premium  content,  increased  levels  of
promotions and service plan discounts, new market entrants, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and
regulatory  changes.  In  addition,  increasing  government  incentives  related  to  network  deployment  may  enhance  the  ability  of
certain of our competitors to compete with us. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers
merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication
services. In addition, DISH Network Corporation has committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network in each of its
license areas capable of serving at least 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023, which could result in additional competitive
pressures in the U.S. wireless industry.

We also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and
capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings
in  mobile  data.  For  example,  Microsoft  Corporation,  Alphabet  Inc.,  Apple  Inc.,  Meta  Platforms,  Inc.  and  others  are  offering
alternative  means  for  messaging  and  making  wireless  voice  calls  that,  in  certain  cases,  can  be  used  in  lieu  of  the  wireless
providers'  voice  service,  as  well  as  alternative  means  of  accessing  video  content.  In  addition,  we  expect  to  see  increasing
competition  in  the  provisioning  of  internet  access  by  low  Earth  orbit  satellite  companies  as  well  in  the  area  of  fixed  wireless
offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers.

With  respect  to  our  wireline  connectivity  services,  we  compete  against cable  companies,  wireless  service  providers,  domestic
and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top (OTT) providers
and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. We also face increasing competition from
other  providers  of  VoIP  services  as  well  as  internet  portal  providers.  Cable  operators  have  increased  the  size  and  capacity  of
their networks in order to deliver digital products and services. Several major cable operators offer bundles with wireless services
through strategic relationships. Traditional wireless carriers are also bundling broadband internet offerings with wireless services
while increasing their broadband internet footprint. Customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content
from various online services. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT offerings. We also
expect  customer  migration  from  traditional  voice  services  to  wireless  services  to  continue  as  a  growing  number  of  customers
place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative.

We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry:

•  Network reliability, speed, capacity and coverage. We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality, fast and
reliable service to be a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction. With the development of 5G
technologies, wireless service providers are increasingly focusing their marketing efforts on network quality, speed and
coverage,  sometimes  directly  targeting  customers  of  Verizon.  In  addition,  lower  prices,  improved  service  quality  and
new service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of connectivity
services.  We  and  other  network-based  providers  must  ensure  that  our  networks  can  meet  these  increasing  capacity
usage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage.

•

Pricing.  With  respect  to  wireless  services  and  equipment,  pricing  plays  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the  wireless
competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a
range of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with
other content and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of
Verizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options,
which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device
leasing  arrangements.    In  addition,  aggressive  device  promotions  have  become  more  common  in  an  effort  to  gain  a
greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers. Pricing also plays
an  important  role  in  the  wireline  competitive  landscape,  as  traditional  service  providers  compete  aggressively  in
offerings  such  as  IP  Networking,  Core  Voice  and  other  legacy  products.  In  addition,  as  non-traditional  modes  of
providing  wireline  communication  services  emerge,  new  entrants  attempt  to  capture  market  share  from  incumbents

   9

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

using  competitive  pricing.  For  example,  VoIP  and  portal-based  voice  and  video  calling  is  often  free  or  nearly  free  for
customers and supported by advertising revenues.

•  Customer  service.  We  believe  that  high-quality  customer  service  is  a  key  factor  in  retaining  customers  and  attracting
new customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based
on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to
promote long-term relationships and minimize churn.

Customer  service  is  highly  valued  by  our  Business  customers.  We  provide  Global  Enterprise  and  Public  Sector  and
Other customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of
our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers. We service our Small and Medium Business customers
through service representatives and online support, as well as through store-based representatives for small business
customers. For Wholesale customers, we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives.

•

•

Product  differentiation.  Customer  and  revenue  growth  are  increasingly  dependent  on  the  development  of  new  and
enhanced products and services, as the delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating.
Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband, video
and  wireless  connections.  To  compete  effectively,  providers  need  to  continuously  review,  improve  and  refine  their
product  portfolio  and  develop  and  rapidly  deploy  new  products  and  services  tailored  to  the  needs  of  customers.  We
continue  to  pursue  the  development  and  rapid  deployment  of  new  and  innovative  products  and  services,  both
independently  and  in  collaboration  with  application  providers,  content  providers  and  device  manufacturers.  Features
such  as  wireless  and  wireline  inter-operability  are  becoming  increasingly  important,  driven  by  both  customer  demand
and technological advancement.

Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the
wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary distribution
channels among our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services, web-based sales and fulfillment
capabilities, outside sales teams and telemarketing, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our
sale of wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end users.

In addition to these competitive factors and trends, our competitive position also depends on our ability to market our products
and services effectively, anticipate and respond to various factors and trends affecting our industries, as well as the availability of
capital resources.

Companies  with  a  global  presence  are  increasingly  competing  with  us  in  our  Business  segment. A  relatively  small  number  of
telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and,
to  a  lesser  extent,  the  global  wholesale  market.  We  compete  with  these  providers  for  large  contracts  to  provide  integrated
solutions  to  global  enterprises  and  government  customers.  Many  of  these  companies  have  strong  market  presence,  brand
recognition  and  existing  customer  relationships,  all  of  which  contribute  to  intensifying  competition  that  may  affect  our  future
revenue growth.

In the Small and Medium Business market, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed
and simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumer-like "look and feel" are becoming key differentiators for customers who
are seeking full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses. Several major cable
operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.

In the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition levels remain high, primarily as a result of increased
industry  focus  on  technology  convergence.  We  compete  in  this  area  with  system  integrators,  carriers,  and  hardware  and
software providers. In addition, some of the largest information technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions,
divesting  non-strategic  assets  and  forging  new  alliances  to  improve  their  cost  structure.  Many  new  alliances  and  acquisitions
have focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software defined networking, communication applications and other
computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of in-house machines.

Our  Wholesale  business  competes  with  traditional  carriers  for  long-haul,  voice  and  IP  services.  In  addition,  mobile  video  and
data  needs  are  driving  a  greater  need  for  wireless  backhaul.  Network  providers,  cable  companies  and  niche  players  are
competitors for this business opportunity.

Regulatory Trends

Regulatory Landscape

Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market, as described above. Some of our competitors are subject to fewer
regulatory  constraints  than  Verizon.  For  many  services  offered  by  Verizon,  the  FCC  is  our  primary  regulator.  The  FCC  has
jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended
(Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                10

Federal, State and Local Regulation

Wireless Services

The  FCC  regulates  several  aspects  of  our  wireless  operations.  Generally,  the  FCC  has  jurisdiction  over  the  construction,
operation,  acquisition  and  transfer  of  wireless  communications  systems.  All  wireless  services  require  use  of  radio  frequency
spectrum,  the  assignment  and  distribution  of  which  is  subject  to  FCC  oversight.  If  demand  continues  to  increase  or  if  new
spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses
or  leasing  spectrum  from  others,  or  by  participating  in  a  competitive  bidding  process  to  acquire  new  spectrum  from  the  FCC.
Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions.

Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services,
including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject
to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a
wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by
that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require
licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical
limitations.  The  FCC  has  also  imposed  certain  specific  mandates  on  wireless  carriers,  including  construction  and  geographic
coverage  requirements,  technical  operating  standards,  provision  of  enhanced  911  services,  roaming  obligations  and
requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities.

The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers.
The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other "terms and conditions" of wireless service. For example, some states
impose reporting and consumer protection requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues
(for  example,  use  of  wireless  handsets  while  driving),  universal  service  funding,  and  taxation  matters.  Some  states  are  also
considering  new  network  reliability  or  service  quality  requirements  that  may  affect  how  and  where  we  provide  services  if  not
preempted by federal law. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land
use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.

Broadband

Verizon  offers  many  different  broadband  services.  The  FCC  currently  recognizes  broadband  internet  access  services  as
"information  services"  subject  to  a  "light  touch"  regulatory  approach  rather  than  to  the  traditional,  utilities-style  regulations.
However, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, several states have adopted or are
considering adopting laws or executive orders that would regulate broadband.  Although some of these have been challenged in
court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed
to the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content.
Our  broadband  commitment  can  be  found  on  our  website  at  https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-
commitment.

Wireline Voice

Verizon  offers  many  different  wireline  voice  services,  including  traditional  telephone  service  and  other  services  that  rely  on
technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be "common carrier"
services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and
other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers
must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.

State  public  utility  commissions  regulate  Verizon’s  telephone  operations  with  respect  to  certain  telecommunications  intrastate
matters. Verizon operates as an "incumbent local exchange carrier" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent
operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other
wireline  operations  that  are  more  lightly  regulated.  Some  states,  including  California,  impose  reporting  requirements  and  are
considering new network reliability or service quality requirements for wireline voice services, including for VoIP.

Video

Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply
to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel
video services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-
wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.

Privacy and Data Security

We are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all
parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in
the  artificial  intelligence  and  IoT  space.  At  the  federal  level,  our  business  is  governed  by  the  FCC  or  the  Federal  Trade
Commission  (FTC),  depending  on  the  product  or  service.  The  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act,  Europe's  General  Data
Protection  Regulation  and  a  number  of  other  privacy  laws  recently  adopted  by  other  states  and  countries  include  significant

   11

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

penalties  for  non-compliance.  Generally,  attention  to  privacy  and  data  security  requirements  is  increasing  at  all  levels  of
government  globally,  and  privacy-related  legislation  has  been  introduced  or  is  under  consideration  in  many  locations.  These
regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.

Public Safety and Cybersecurity

The  FCC  plays  a  role  in  addressing  public  safety  concerns  by  regulating  emergency  communications  services  and  mandating
widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks
that have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the
cybersecurity  practices  of  providers.  The  FCC  is  also  addressing  the  use  by American  companies  of  equipment  produced  by
certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks
from  vendors  under  such  restrictions.  In  addition,  due  to  recent  natural  disasters,  federal  and  state  agencies  may  attempt  to
impose  regulations  to  ensure  continuity  of  service  during  disasters.  For  example,  the  FCC  adopted  rules  requiring  wireless
providers  to  support  roaming  on  each  other’s  networks  during  disasters,  and  the  California  Public  Utilities  Commission  has
imposed regulations relating to back-up power for communications facilities.

Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access

The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline
traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the
rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is
both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments.

Human Capital Resources

At Verizon, we know that our people are one of our most valuable assets. In order to realize our core business strategy, we have
developed human capital programs and practices that support, develop and care for our employees from the time they join our
team through the entirety of their careers with Verizon. These programs are centered on the following principles:

•

Attract the right talent for our future and maintain a diverse workforce with high-value skills and expertise.

•  Develop our employees to their full potential through best-in-class educational programs and exceptional development

experiences and create a culture of continuous learning and engagement.

•

Inspire  individuals  to  build  a  career  at  Verizon  by  providing  meaningful  work  and  upskilling  opportunities  and
establishing an inclusive work environment for all.

Verizon is committed to being an employer of choice. With approximately 117,100 employees on a full-time equivalent basis as of
December  31,  2022,  89%  of  whom  are  based  in  the  U.S.,  we  know  that  we  need  employees  with  diverse  backgrounds,
experiences and perspectives to best meet the needs of the diverse customers and communities we serve. Our human capital
programs  and  practices  are  designed  to  create  a  workplace  where  employees  are  empowered  to  share  their  authentic  selves
and  feel  seen  and  heard  as  vital  contributors  to  Verizon’s  corporate  purpose.  In  addition,  Verizon  has  extensive  on-the-job
training  opportunities,  tuition  reimbursement  programs  and  career  development  support  to  enable  our  employees  to  maximize
their  potential  and  thrive  professionally.  Our  long-standing  commitment  to  diversity  and  inclusion  has  resulted  in  a  strong
representation of women and people of color. As of December 31, 2022, Verizon's global workforce was approximately 66.5%
male,  33.3%  female  and  0.2%  unknown  or  undeclared,  and  the  race/ethnicity  of  our  U.S.  workforce  was  52.5%  White,  20.0%
Black, 12.9% Hispanic, 8.2% Asian, 0.5% American Indian/Alaskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 2.7% two or
more races, and 2.9% unknown or undeclared. Women represented 36.4% of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and
above). People of color represented 32.5% of U.S. senior leadership.

Verizon  respects  our  employees’  rights  to  freedom  of  association  and  collective  bargaining  in  compliance  with  applicable  law,
including  the  right  to  join  or  not  join  labor  unions.  We  have  a  long  history  of  working  with  the  Communications  Workers  of
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers—the two unions that in total represent approximately 22.5% of
our  employees  as  of  December  31,  2022.  The  current  collective  bargaining  agreements  covering  our  union-represented
employees  who  serve  customers  in  our  Mid-Atlantic  and  Northeast  service  areas  extend  through August  1,  2026.  In  addition,
where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative bodies such as works council. Verizon meets with
U.S.  national  and  local  union  leaders,  as  well  as  works  council  leaders  outside  the  U.S.,  to  talk  about  key  business  topics,
including  safety,  customer  service,  plans  to  improve  operational  processes,  our  business  performance  and  the  impacts  that
changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

We  own  or  have  licenses  to  various  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks,  domain  names  and  other  intellectual  property  rights
necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain
names  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights  within  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  also  actively  grant  licenses,  in
exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies
that  enable  them  to  utilize  certain  of  our  intellectual  property  rights  and  proprietary  technology  as  part  of  their  products  and
services.  Such  licenses  enable  the  licensees  to  take  advantage  of  Verizon's  brands  and  the  results  of  Verizon’s  research  and
development  efforts.  While  these  licenses  result  in  valuable  consideration  for  Verizon,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  loss  of  such
consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations.

We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in
exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on
third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers
of  products  or  services  that  we  sell  to  our  customers,  if  successful,  could  require  us  to  pay  damages  or  royalties,  rebrand,  or
cease offering the relevant products or services.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The  following  discussion  of  "Risk  Factors"  identifies  factors  that  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations,  financial
condition or future performance. This information should be read in conjunction with "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial  Condition  and  Result  of  Operations"  and  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes.  The  following
discussion  of  risks  is  not  all-inclusive  but  is  designed  to  highlight  what  we  believe  are  the  material  factors  to  consider  when
evaluating  our  business  and  expectations.  These  factors  could  cause  our  future  results  to  differ  materially  from  our  historical
results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements.

Economic and Strategic Risks

We face significant competition that may reduce our profits.

We  face  significant  competition  in  our  industries.  The  rapid  development  of  new  technologies,  services  and  products  has
eliminated  many  of  the  traditional  distinctions  among  wireless,  cable,  internet  and  local  and  long  distance  communication
services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telecommunications companies, cable companies, wireless
service  providers,  satellite  providers,  technology  companies  and  application  and  device  providers.  While  these  changes  have
enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own
competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings.

Wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that
vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our
customers and putting pressure on pricing and margins. In addition, the wireless industry’s customer growth rate could moderate
in  comparison  to  historical  growth  rates,  leading  to  increased  competition  for  customers.  Our  ability  to  compete  effectively  will
depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality
of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and
distribution channels, our ability to market our products and services effectively and our capital resources. It will also depend on
how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business
models,  changes  in  consumer  preferences  and  demand  for  existing  services,  demographic  trends  and  evolving  economic
conditions,  including  inflation.  If  we  are  not  able  to  respond  successfully  to  these  competitive  challenges,  our  results  of
operations  and  financial  condition  could  be  adversely  impacted.  In  addition,  a  projected  sustained  decline  in  a  reporting  unit's
revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and result in an impairment charge, which could
have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

If we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer
demand on a timely basis, or if the deployment of our 5G network is delayed or hindered for any reason, we

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                14

may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and
experience reduced profits.

Our  industries  are  rapidly  changing  as  new  technologies  are  developed  that  offer  consumers  an  array  of  choices  for  their
communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need
to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’
changing  demands.  If  we  are  unable  to  meet  future  challenges  from  competing  technologies  on  a  timely  basis  or  at  an
acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or
the success of new services in the market. If our new services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated
with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be
adversely affected.

In addition, the deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to equipment and spectrum
availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory matters that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. These
issues  could  result  in  significant  costs,  put  us  at  a  competitive  disadvantage,  or  reduce  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the
enhancements to our networks.

As  we  introduce  new  offerings  and  technologies,  such  as  5G  technology,  we  must  phase  out  outdated  and  unprofitable
technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition,
there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.

Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations and
financial condition.

Unfavorable  economic  conditions,  such  as  a  recession  or  economic  slowdown  in  the  U.S.  or  elsewhere,  or  inflation  in  the
markets in which we operate, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and
our cost of doing business. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing
purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost
products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may
delay  purchasing  decisions,  delay  full  implementation  of  service  offerings  or  reduce  their  use  of  services.  In  addition,  adverse
economic  conditions  may  lead  to  an  increased  number  of  our  consumer  and  business  customers  that  are  unable  to  pay  for
services.  Unfavorable  economic  conditions  could  also  amplify  other  risk  factors  discussed  in  this  section,  including,  but  not
limited to, our competitive position and margins. In 2022, as a result of the inflationary environment in the U.S., we experienced
increases in our direct costs, including electricity and other energy-related costs for our network operations, and transportation
and  labor  costs,  as  well  as  increased  interest  expenses  related  to  rising  interest  rates.  We  believe  that  this  inflationary
environment  and  the  resulting  decline  in  real  wages  in  the  U.S.  are  altering  consumer  preferences  and  causing  consumers  to
become  more  price  conscious.  These  factors,  along  with  impacts  of  the  intense  competition  in  our  industries,  resulted  in
increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2022, and caused us to lower our growth expectations and related financial
guidance.    We  expect  the  inflationary  environment  and  these  other  pressures  to  continue  into  2023. Although  we  are  taking
various  measures  to  improve  efficiency  and  reduce  costs,  those  measures  may  ultimately  be  ineffective  or  insufficient.  If  the
economic  slowdown  in  the  U.S.,  inflation  and  other  unfavorable  economic  conditions  continue  or  worsen,  they  could  have  a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Operational Risks

Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.

Cyber  attacks,  including  through  the  use  of  malware,  computer  viruses,  distributed  denial  of  services  attacks,  ransomware
attacks,  credential  harvesting,  social  engineering  and  other  means  for  obtaining  unauthorized  access  to  or  disrupting  the
operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse
effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information
of  customers  or  employees  or  valuable  technical  and  marketing  information,  as  well  as  disruptions  to  our  or  our  customers’
operations. Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent
years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the
attacker. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and
updating  to  address  their  increasing  prevalence  and  sophistication.  While,  to  date,  we  have  not  been  subject  to  cyber  attacks
that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we
take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to
repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future.

The  inability  to  operate  or  use  our  networks  and  systems  or  those  of  our  suppliers,  vendors  and  other  service  providers  as  a
result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market
share to our competitors. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered
to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the
use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such
as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if

   15

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Our presence in the IoT
industry, which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and
expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of
security  or  a  theft  or  other  compromise  of  valuable  information,  such  as  financial  data  and  sensitive  or  private  personal
information,  could  result  in  lawsuits  and  government  claims,  investigations  or  proceedings.  Any  of  these  occurrences  could
damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’s
results of operation or financial condition.

Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, acts of war, terrorist or other hostile acts could cause
damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.

Our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, acts of war, terrorist or other hostile acts, natural disasters
or the potential impacts of climate change, including the increasing prevalence and intensity of hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, hail
and storms. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting
in  degradation  or  disruption  of  service  to  our  customers,  as  well  as  significant  recovery  time  and  expenditures  to  resume
operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. We are
implementing, and will continue to implement, measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these
events  in  the  future,  but  these  measures  and  our  overall  disaster  recovery  planning  may  not  be  sufficient  for  all  eventualities.
These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need
to operate our business and provide products to our customers. These occurrences could result in lost revenues from business
interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits.

Public health crises could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We  are  subject  to  risks  related  to  public  health  crises,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  an  adverse  effect  on  our
operating  results  in  2020.  Our  business  is  based  on  our  ability  to  provide  products  and  services  to  customers  throughout  the
United States and around the world and the ability of those customers to use and pay for those products and services for their
businesses  and  in  their  daily  lives. As  a  result,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  materially
adversely affected by a public health crisis that significantly impacts the way customers use and are able to pay for our products
and services, the way our employees are able to provide services to our customers, and the ways that our partners and suppliers
are  able  to  provide  products  and  services  to  us.  For  example,  public  and  private  sector  policies  and  initiatives  to  reduce  the
transmission  of  COVID-19  and  initiatives  Verizon  took  in  response  to  the  health  crisis  to  promote  the  health  and  safety  of  our
employees  and  provide  critical  infrastructure  and  connectivity  to  our  customers,  along  with  the  related  global  slowdown  in
economic activity, resulted in decreased revenues, increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2020. In addition, such a
crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances, such
as risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationships, risks of an economic slowdown, regulatory risks, and the costs
and availability of financing.

We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.

We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services,
such  as  fiber,  switch  and  network  equipment,  smartphones  and  other  wireless  devices  that  we  need  in  order  to  operate  our
business  and  provide  products  and  services  to  our  customers.  For  example,  our  smartphone  and  other  device  suppliers  often
rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are
a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers
or  vendors  could  fail  to  provide  equipment  or  service  on  a  timely  basis,  or  fail  to  meet  our  performance  expectations,  for  a
number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of geopolitical factors, public health
crises, natural disasters or the potential impacts of global climate change. If such failures occur, we may be unable to provide
products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our
networks. Due to the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could
be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers
with  products  or  services  from  another  source,  especially  if  the  replacement  became  necessary  on  short  notice.  Any  such
disruption  could  increase  our  costs,  decrease  our  operating  efficiencies  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,
results of operations and financial condition.

The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend,
including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We
are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to
continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.

A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs
or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts.

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 22.5% of our workforce is represented by the Communications Workers of America or
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent
negotiations  we  could  incur  additional  costs  and/or  experience  work  stoppages,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                16

operations. In addition, while a small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional wireline operations is represented by
unions for bargaining, we cannot predict what impact increased union density in this workforce could have on our operations.

Regulatory and Legal Risks

Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business
prospects or results of operations.

Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, and our international
operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or
impose  conditions  on  our  ability  to  operate  in  designated  areas  and  provide  specified  products  or  services.  We  are  frequently
required  to  maintain  licenses  for  our  operations  and  conduct  our  operations  in  accordance  with  prescribed  standards.  We  are
often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is
impossible  to  predict  with  any  certainty  the  outcome  of  pending  federal  and  state  regulatory  proceedings  relating  to  our
operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit
our  ability  to  expand  our  business  and  introduce  new  products  and  services.  Similarly,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  we  will  be
successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example,
the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on,
certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

New laws or regulations or changes to the existing  regulatory framework at the federal, state, and local, or international level,
such  as  those  described  below,  those  that  incentivize  business  models  or  technologies  different  from  ours  or  requirements
limiting our ability to continue or discontinue service to customers could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and
wireless networks and operate our businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our
ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers.

•

Privacy  and  data  protection  –  We  are  subject  to  federal,  state  and  international  laws  related  to  privacy  and  data
protection.  In  particular,  the  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act,  Europe's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  and  a
number  of  other  privacy  laws  recently  adopted  by  other  states  and  countries  include  significant  penalties  for  non-
compliance.  Generally,  attention  to  privacy  and  data  security  requirements  is  increasing  at  all  levels  of  government
globally,  and  privacy-related  legislation  has  been  introduced  or  is  under  consideration  in  many  locations.  These
regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.

to

regulating  broadband

•  Regulation  of  broadband  internet  access  services  –  In  its  2015 Title  II  Order,  the  FCC  nullified  its  longstanding  "light
touch"  approach
these  services  as
telecommunications  services  subject  to  utilities-style  common  carriage  regulation. The  FCC  repealed  the  2015 Title  II
Order  in  December  2017,  and  returned  to  its  traditional  light-touch  approach  for  these  services.  The  2017  order  has
been  affirmed  in  part  by  the  D.C.  Circuit  but  may  be  revisited  by  the  FCC  or  by  Congress.  Several  states  have  also
adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements
on  some  of  our  services  (in  some  cases  different  from  the  FCC’s  2015  rules).  Although  some  of  these  have  been
challenged in court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain.

internet  access  services  and  "reclassified"

•

"Open  Access"  –  We  hold  certain  wireless  licenses  that  require  us  to  comply  with  so-called  "open  access"  FCC
regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications
of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and
local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.

•  Climate-Related Regulation and Policy – Due to the nature of our operations, we have been, and expect to continue to
be  impacted  by  regulatory  developments  related  to  climate  change,  including,  for  example,  the  direct  regulation  of
greenhouse  gas  emissions  or  carbon  policies  that  could  result  in  a  tax  on  such  emissions.  In  addition,  policy-driven
changes  in  the  prices  of  fuel  or  energy  in  geographies  in  which  we  operate  could  make  it  more  expensive  for  us  to
purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs
associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels.

These developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions
could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can
expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.

We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or
settlements.

We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation and claims in arbitration, including, but not limited to, shareholder derivative
suits,  patent  infringement  lawsuits,  wage  and  hour  class  actions,  contract  and  commercial  claims,  personal  injury  claims,
property claims, environmental claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition,
our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones

   17

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required
to pay significant awards or settlements.

Financial Risks

Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and
does not retire existing debt.

As  of  December  31,  2022,  Verizon  had  approximately  $130.6  billion  of  outstanding  unsecured  indebtedness,  $9.4  billion  of
unused  borrowing  capacity  under  our  existing  revolving  credit  facility  and  $20.0  billion  of  outstanding  secured  indebtedness.
Verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:

•

requiring  Verizon  to  dedicate  significant  cash  flow  from  operations  to  the  payment  of  principal,  interest  and  other
amounts  payable  on  our  debt,  which  would  reduce  the  funds  we  have  available  for  other  purposes,  such  as  working
capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;

•  making  it  more  difficult  or  expensive  for  Verizon  to  obtain  any  necessary  future  financing  for  working  capital,  capital
expenditures,  debt  service  requirements,  debt  refinancing,  acquisitions  or  other  purposes  and  limiting  its  ability  to
repurchase common stock;

•

reducing Verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions;

•  making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and

•

exposing  Verizon  to  increased  interest  rate  risk  to  the  extent  that  our  debt  obligations  are  subject  to  variable  interest
rates.

Adverse changes in the financial markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the
availability of financing.

We  require  a  significant  amount  of  capital  to  operate  and  grow  our  business.  We  fund  our  capital  needs  in  part  through
borrowings  in  the  public  and  private  credit  markets. Adverse  changes  in  the  financial  markets,  including  increases  in  interest
rates or changes in exchange rates, could increase our cost of borrowing, require us to post a significant amount of collateral,
and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability
to  obtain  funding  under  asset-backed  debt  transactions  is  subject  to  our  ability  to  continue  to  originate  a  sufficient  amount  of
assets  eligible  to  be  securitized.  Our  borrowing  costs  also  can  be  affected  by  short-  and  long-term  debt  ratings  assigned  by
independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics.
A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A
severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and
such instability could also affect our access to financing.

Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our
profitability and increase our funding commitments.

With  approximately  117,100  employees  and  approximately 186,700  retirees  as  of  December  31,  2022  eligible  to  participate  in
Verizon’s benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our
profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several
factors, including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit
plan  trusts  and  changes  in  the  discount  rate  and  mortality  assumptions  used  to  calculate  pension  and  other  postretirement
expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and
increase our funding commitments.

Item 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities

The principal market for trading in the common stock of the Company is the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VZ".

As  of  December  31,  2022,  there  were  462,587  shareholders  of  record.  In  addition,  a  significant  number  of  holders  of  the
Company's common stock are "street name" or beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers, and other
financial institutions.

Stock Repurchases

In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million
shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million,
or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. Under the program, shares may
be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions, on the open market, or otherwise, including through plans complying with
Rule  10b5-1  under  the  Exchange Act. The  timing  and  number  of  shares  purchased  under  the  program,  if  any,  will  depend  on
market conditions and our capital allocation priorities.

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of the Company's common stock
under our authorized share buyback program. At December 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased
by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Verizon  Communications  Inc.  (the  Company)  is  a  holding  company  that,  acting  through  its  subsidiaries  (together  with  the
Company,  collectively,  Verizon),  is  one  of  the  world’s  leading  providers  of  communications,  technology,  information  and
entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we
offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand
for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.

To  compete  effectively  in  today’s  dynamic  marketplace,  we  are  focused  on  the  capabilities  of  our  high-performing  networks  to
drive  growth  based  on  delivering  what  customers  want  and  need  in  the  digital  world.  In  2022,  we  focused  on  maintaining  our
network leadership, including by rapidly deploying C-Band spectrum; retaining and growing our high-quality customer base while
balancing profitability in challenging market conditions; and driving monetization of our networks, platforms and solutions. We are
creating business value by earning the trust of our stakeholders, limiting our environmental impact and supporting our customer
base growth while creating social benefit through our products and services. Our strategy requires significant capital investments
primarily  to  acquire  wireless  spectrum,  put  the  spectrum  into  service,  provide  additional  capacity  for  growth  in  our  networks,
invest  in  the  fiber  that  supports  our  businesses,  evolve  and  maintain  our  networks  and  develop  and  maintain  significant
advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. 2022 was a peak year of capital investment for us as we
rapidly deployed C-Band spectrum. We believe that this spectrum, together with our industry leading millimeter wave spectrum
holding, 4G LTE network and fiber infrastructure, will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth.

We are consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to secure our leadership in both fourth-generation (4G)
and fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. We expect that our next-generation multi-use platform, which we call the Intelligent
Edge Network, will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology
and  create  new  opportunities  in  the  business  market  in  a  cost  efficient  manner.  Our  network  leadership  is  the  hallmark  of  our
brand and the foundation for the connectivity, platforms and solutions upon which we build our competitive advantage.

Verizon Consumer Group

Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless
services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand,
TracFone  Wireless,  Inc.  (TracFone)  brands  and  through  wholesale  and  other  arrangements.  We  also  provide  fixed  wireless
access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and
over  a  traditional  copper-based  network  to  customers  who  are  not  served  by  Fios.  Our  Consumer  segment's  wireless  and
wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access
from us on a wholesale basis.

Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in
advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only
to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in
advance.  The  Consumer  segment  also  offers  several  categories  of  wireless  equipment  to  customers,  including  a  variety  of
smartphones  and  other  handsets,  wireless-enabled  internet  devices,  such  as  tablets,  and  other  wireless-enabled  connected
devices, such as smart watches.

In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity
solutions,  including  internet,  video  and  voice  services,  and  wireless  network  access  to  resellers  on  a  wholesale  basis.  The
Consumer  segment's  operating  revenues  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  totaled  $103.5  billion,  an  increase  of
$8.2  billion,  or  8.6%,  compared  to  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021.  See  "Segment  Results  of  Operations"  for  additional
information regarding our Consumer segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics.

Verizon Business Group

Our  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  data,  video  and
conferencing  services,  corporate  networking  solutions,  security  and  managed  network  services,  local  and  long  distance  voice
services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products, including solutions that support
fleet  tracking  management,  compliance  management,  field  service  management,  asset  tracking  and  other  types  of  mobile
resource  management.  We  also  provide  FWA  broadband  through  our  wireless  networks.  We  provide  these  products  and
services  to  businesses,  government  customers  and  wireless  and  wireline  carriers  across  the  U.S.  and  select  products  and
services  to  customers  around  the  world. The  Business  segment's  operating  revenues  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022
totaled  $31.1  billion  and  remained  relatively  flat  compared  to  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021.  See  "Segment  Results  of
Operations" for additional information regarding our Business segment’s operating performance and selected operating statistics.

Corporate and Other

Corporate  and  other  primarily  includes  insurance  captives,  investments  in  unconsolidated  businesses  and  development  stage
businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

benefit  related  costs  and  interest  and  financing  expenses.  Corporate  and  other  also  includes  the  historical  results  of  divested
businesses, including Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media) divested in September 2021, and other adjustments and gains and
losses  that  are  not  allocated  in  assessing  segment  performance  due  to  their  nature. Although  such  transactions  are  excluded
from  the  business  segment  results,  they  are  included  in  reported  consolidated  earnings.  Gains  and  losses  from  these
transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating
decision  maker’s  assessment  of  segment  performance.  See  "Consolidated  Results  of  Operations"  for  additional  information
regarding Corporate and other results.

Capital Expenditures and Investments

We continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the
center of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for
capital  expenditures,  inclusive  of  approximately  $6.2  billion  in  C-Band  related  capital  expenditures.  See  "Cash  Flows  Used  in
Investing Activities" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at
expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing
in the information economy.

Global Network and Technology

We are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also
building our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions
and  distributed  antenna  systems.  Network  densification  enables  us  to  add  capacity  to  address  increasing  mobile  video
consumption  and  the  growing  demand  for  IoT  products  and  services  on  our  4G  LTE  and  5G  networks. Over  the  past  several
years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and
mobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows
our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-
Band  spectrum,  which  has  been  built  out  to  cover  approximately  189  million  POPs  in  the  U.S.  as  of  December  31,  2022.  We
expect  to  continue  deploying  C-Band  spectrum  across  the  continental  U.S.  as  more  and  more  of  the  spectrum  becomes
available for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service
to  run  simultaneously  with  4G  LTE  on  multiple  spectrum  bands.  With  DSS,  whenever  customers  move  outside  Verizon’s
millimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum
bands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve
both 4G and 5G customers.

To  compensate  for  the  shrinking  market  for  traditional  copper-based  products,  we  continue  to  build  fiber-based  networks
supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing.
We  are  transforming  the  architecture  of  our  networks  into  our  Intelligent  Edge  Network,  providing  improved  efficiency  and
virtualization,  increased  automation  and  opportunities  for  edge  computing  services  that  will  support  our  fiber-based  and  radio
access  network  technologies.  We  expect  that  this  new  architecture  will  simplify  operations  by  eliminating  legacy  network
elements,  speed  the  deployment  of  5G  wireless  technology  and  create  new  opportunities  in  the  business  market  in  a  cost-
efficient manner.

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Corporate and other revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media, which was
completed  in  September  2021.  Verizon  Media's  total  operating  revenues  were  approximately  $5.3  billion  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media.

Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."

Cost of Services

Cost  of  services  includes  the  following  costs  directly  attributable  to  a  service:  salaries  and  wages,  benefits,  materials  and
supplies,  content  costs,  contracted  services,  network  access  and  transport  costs,  customer  provisioning  costs,  computer
systems  support,  costs  to  support  our  outsourcing  contracts  and  technical  facilities  and  traffic  acquisition  costs.  Aggregate
customer  service  costs,  which  include  billing  and  service  provisioning,  are  allocated  between  Cost  of  services  and  Selling,
general and administrative expense.

Cost of services decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•
•
•
•
•
•

•

a decrease in traffic acquisition costs of $2.2 billion primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media;
a decrease in personnel costs of $745 million primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media;
a decrease in digital content of $335 million primarily driven by the sale of Verizon Media;
a decrease in other direct costs of $322 million primarily related to the sale of Verizon Media;
a decrease in regulatory fees of $201 million due to a lower Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF) volume and rate;
an  increase  in  access  costs  of  $614  million  primarily  due  to  the  inclusion  of  TracFone  results,  partially  offset  by  a
decline in voice services; and
an  increase  in  rent  expense  of  $212  million related  to  adding  capacity  to  the  networks  to  support  demand  and  lease
modifications for certain existing cell towers in April 2021 to support the build out of our 5G wireless network.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media and the acquisition of
TracFone.

Cost of Wireless Equipment

Cost of wireless equipment increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:
an increase of $2.2 billion due to the inclusion of TracFone results;
an increase of $2.1 billion driven by a higher volume of wireless devices sold primarily related to upgrades; and
an increase of $1.3 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold.

•
•
•

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  includes  salaries  and  wages  and  benefits  not  directly  attributable  to  a  service  or
product, the provision for credit losses, taxes other than income taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, call center and
information  technology  costs,  regulatory  fees,  professional  service  fees  and  rent  and  utilities  for  administrative  space.  Also
included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed above in "Cost of Services."

Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•

•
•

•

•

an increase in the provision for credit losses of $822 million driven by increased device payment loan volume and an
increase in the expected loss rate primarily as a result of the change in device payment plan terms to 36 months, as
well as actions taken in prior years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;
the $706 million net gain on the sale of Verizon Media in 2021;
an  increase  in  personnel  costs  of  $603  million  primarily  related  to the  inclusion  of TracFone  results  and  increases  in
third-party employee costs due to contracted services, partially offset by a decrease due to the sale of Verizon Media;
a decrease of $367 million in other general expenses driven by lease terminations primarily due to the sale of Verizon
Media; and
the $223 million loss resulting from agreements entered into to sell certain wireless licenses in 2021.

losses from non-operating asset dispositions, debt extinguishment costs, components of net periodic pension and postretirement
benefit cost and income and certain foreign exchange gains and losses.

Other income (expense), net changed during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•

•

a net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement gain of $1.7 billion recorded during 2022, compared with a
net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement gain of $2.4 billion recorded during 2021; and
net debt extinguishment losses of $1.1 billion primarily related to tender offers in 2022, compared with losses of
$3.5 billion in connection with tender offers, the redemptions of securities issued by Verizon and open market
repurchases of various Company and subsidiary notes in 2021.

•

an increase in interest costs due to a combination of higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances;
partially offset by
an  increase  in  capitalized  interest  costs  as  a  result  of  a  full  year  of  capitalized  interest  on  C-Band  licenses  in  2022
compared to a partial year in 2021.

See  Note  4  and  Note  7  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional  information  on  spectrum  licenses  and  debt

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income
taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was comparable to the similar period in 2021. The
decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes in 2022.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to
the consolidated financial statements.

Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA

Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated
Adjusted  EBITDA,  which  are  presented  below,  are  non-generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  measures  that  we
believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a
more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and
acquisitions  that  occurred  in  prior  years,  as  well  as  in  evaluating  operating  performance  in  relation  to  Verizon’s  competitors.
Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense to net income.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational
items:  equity  in  earnings  of  unconsolidated  businesses  and  other  income  and  expense,  net,  as  well  as  the  effect  of  certain
special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in
evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s
evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a
company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and
depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to
prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional information.

It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’s GAAP financial
information,  and  it  should  be  considered  by  the  reader  in  addition  to,  but  not  instead  of,  the  financial  statements  prepared  in
accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not
to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures
in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and
accurately  assess  both  consolidated  and  segment  performance.  The  non-GAAP  financial  information  presented  may  be
determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies.

The changes in Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the table above during
2022  compared  to  2021,  were  primarily  a  result  of  the  factors  described  in  connection  with  operating  revenues  and  operating
expenses.

Segment Results of Operations

We  have  two  reportable  segments  that  we  operate  and  manage  as  strategic  business  units  -  Consumer  and  Business.  We
measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent
with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance.

To aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income, management uses the following
operating  statistics  to  evaluate  the  overall  effectiveness  of  our  segments.  We  believe  these  operating  statistics  are  useful  to
investors  and  other  users  of  our  financial  information  because  they  provide  additional  insight  into  drivers  of  our  segments’
operating results, key trends and performance relative to our peers. These operating statistics may be determined or calculated
differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to those statistics of other companies.

Wireless  retail  connections  are  retail  customer  device  postpaid  and  prepaid  connections  as  of  the  end  of  the  period.  Retail
connections under an account may include those from smartphones and basic phones (collectively, phones), as well as tablets
and other internet devices, including FWA, wearables and retail IoT devices. Wireless retail connections are calculated by adding
total  retail  postpaid  and  prepaid  new  connections  in  the  period  to  prior  period  retail  connections,  and  subtracting  total  retail
postpaid and prepaid disconnects in the period.

Wireless retail postpaid connections are retail postpaid customer device connections as of the end of the period. Retail postpaid
connections under an account may include those from phones, as well as tablets and other internet devices, including postpaid
FWA,  wearables  and  retail  IoT  devices.  Wireless  retail  postpaid  connections  are  calculated  by  adding  retail  postpaid  new
connections in the period to prior period retail postpaid connections, and subtracting retail postpaid disconnects in the period.

Wireless  retail  prepaid  connections  are  retail  prepaid  customer  device  connections  as  of  the  end  of  the  period.  Retail  prepaid
connections  may  include  those  from  phones,  as  well  as  tablets  and  other  internet  devices,  including  prepaid  FWA,  and
wearables.  Wireless  retail  prepaid  connections  are  calculated  by  adding  retail  prepaid  new  connections  in  the  period  to  prior
period retail prepaid connections, and subtracting retail prepaid disconnects in the period.

Fios  internet  connections  are  the  total  number  of  connections  to  the  internet  using  Fios  internet  services  as  of  the  end  of  the
period.  Fios  internet  connections  are  calculated  by  adding  Fios  internet  new  connections  in  the  period  to  prior  period  Fios
internet connections, and subtracting Fios internet disconnects in the period.

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Fios video connections are the total number of connections to traditional linear video programming using Fios video services as
of the end of the period. Fios video connections are calculated by adding Fios video net additions in the period to prior period
Fios  video  connections.  Fios  video  net  additions  are  calculated  by  subtracting  the  Fios  video  disconnects  from  the  Fios  video
new connections.

Total broadband connections are the total number of connections to the internet using Fios internet services, Digital Subscriber
Line  (DSL),  and  postpaid,  prepaid  and  IoT  FWA  as  of  the  end  of  the  period.  Total  broadband  connections  are  calculated  by
adding total broadband connections, net additions in the period to prior period total broadband connections.

Wireless  retail  connections,  net  additions  are  the  total  number  of  additional  retail  customer  device  postpaid  and  prepaid
connections,  less  the  number  of  device  disconnects  in  the  period.  Wireless  retail  connections,  net  additions  in  each  period
presented  are  calculated  by  subtracting  the  total  retail  postpaid  and  prepaid  disconnects,  net  of  certain  adjustments,  from  the
total retail postpaid and prepaid new connections in the period.

Wireless retail postpaid connections, net additions are the total number of additional retail customer device postpaid connections,
less the number of device disconnects in the period. Wireless retail postpaid connections, net additions in each period presented
are calculated by subtracting the retail postpaid disconnects, net of certain adjustments, from the retail postpaid new connections
in the period.

Wireless retail prepaid connections, net additions are the total number of additional retail customer device prepaid connections,
less the number of device disconnects in the period. Wireless retail prepaid connections, net additions in each period presented
are calculated by subtracting the retail prepaid disconnects, net of certain adjustments, from the retail prepaid new connections
in the period.

Wireless  retail  postpaid  phone  connections,  net  additions  are  the  total  number  of  additional  retail  customer  postpaid  phone
connections, less the number of phone disconnects in the period. Wireless retail postpaid phone connections, net additions in
each period presented are calculated by subtracting the retail postpaid phone disconnects, net of certain adjustments, from the
retail postpaid phone new connections in the period.

Total broadband connections, net additions are the total number of additional total broadband connections, less the number of
total broadband disconnects in the period. Total broadband connections, net additions in each period presented are calculated by
subtracting the total broadband disconnects, net of certain adjustments, from the total broadband new connections in the period.

Wireless  Churn  is  the  rate  at  which  service  to  retail,  retail  postpaid,  or  retail  postpaid  phone  connections  is  terminated  on
average  in  the  period.  The  churn  rate  in  each  period  presented  is  calculated  by  dividing  retail  disconnects,  retail  postpaid
disconnects,  or  retail  postpaid  phone  disconnects  by  the  average  retail  connections,  average  retail  postpaid  connections,  or
average retail postpaid phone connections, respectively, in the period.

Wireless retail postpaid ARPA is the calculated average retail postpaid service revenue per account (ARPA) from retail postpaid
accounts in the period. Wireless retail postpaid service revenue does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to
the  Verizon  device  payment  program,  plan  billings  related  to  device  warranty  and  insurance  or  regulatory  fees.  Wireless  retail
postpaid ARPA in each period presented is calculated by dividing retail postpaid service revenue by the average retail postpaid
accounts in the period.

Wireless  retail  postpaid  accounts  are  wireless  retail  customers  that  are  directly  served  and  managed  under  the  Verizon  brand
and use its services as of the end of the period. Accounts include unlimited plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as
well as legacy single connection plans and multi-connection family plans. A single account may include monthly wireless services
for a variety of connected devices. Wireless retail postpaid accounts are calculated by adding retail postpaid new accounts to the
prior period retail postpaid accounts.

Wireless  retail  postpaid  connections  per  account  is  the  calculated  average  number  of  retail  postpaid  connections  per  retail
postpaid account as of the end of the period. Wireless retail postpaid connections per account is calculated by dividing the total
number of retail postpaid connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the end of the period.

Segment  operating  income  margin  reflects  the  profitability  of  the  segment  as  a  percentage  of  revenue.  Segment  operating
income margin is calculated by dividing total segment operating income by total segment operating revenues.

Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below, is a non-
GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. We
believe  this  measure  is  useful  to  management,  investors  and  other  users  of  our  financial  information  in  evaluating  operating
profitability  on  a  more  variable  cost  basis  as  it  excludes  the  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  related  primarily  to  capital
expenditures  and  acquisitions  that  occurred  in  prior  years,  as  well  as  in  evaluating  operating  performance  in  relation  to  our
competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income
(loss). Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. See Note 13 to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Consumer's total operating revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021, as a result of increases in Service and Wireless
equipment revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Other revenue.

Service Revenue

Service revenue increased during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by increases in wireless and Fios service revenues.

Wireless service revenue increased $5.4 billion during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•
•

•
•

an increase of $4.0 billion, representing the net impact of the acquisition of TracFone in the fourth quarter of 2021;
an increase of $769 million in access revenues related to our postpaid plans driven by mobile security products included
in certain device protection packages such that a larger amount of the overall device protection revenue is recognized in
Service  revenue,  pricing  actions  implemented  in  the  second  half  of  2022,  cloud  services,  and  additional  connections
and migrations to higher priced plans, partially offset by related promotions as well as declines in our postpaid phone
customer base;
an increase of $352 million in TravelPass revenues due to an increase in customer international travel; and
an increase of $253 million related to growth in non-retail service revenue.

For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  Fios  service  revenue  totaled  $10.9  billion,  representing  an  increase  of  $127  million
compared  to  2021,  primarily  resulting  from  an  increase  in  Fios  internet  connections,  reflecting  increased  demand  for  higher
broadband speeds, partially offset by a decrease in Fios video and voice revenues.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition of TracFone.

Wireless Equipment Revenue

Wireless equipment revenue increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•
•

•

an increase of $1.4 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold;
an increase of $1.2 billion driven by a higher volume of wireless devices primarily related to a higher rate of upgrades,
partially offset by related promotions; and
an increase of $780 million due to the inclusion of TracFone results.

Other Revenue

Other  revenue  includes  fees  that  partially  recover  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  complying  with  regulatory  and  industry
obligations  and  programs,  revenues  associated  with  certain  products  included  in  our  device  protection  offerings,  leasing  and
interest when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement.

Other revenue decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•

•

•

a decrease of $481 million that resulted from a change in the product mix within the device protection offering such that
a smaller amount of the overall device protection revenue is recognized in Other revenue;
a  decrease  of  $77  million  related  to  interest  recognition  on  equipment  sold  to  the  customer  by  an  authorized  agent
under a device payment plan agreement, mainly due to an increase in contract terms to 36 months; and
a decrease of $51 million in other regulatory surcharges.

an  increase  in  rent  expense  of  $198  million  related  to  adding  capacity  to  the  networks  to  support  demand  and  lease
modifications for certain existing cell towers in April 2021 in connection with the build out of our 5G wireless network.

Cost of Wireless Equipment

Cost of wireless equipment increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:
an increase of $2.2 billion due to the inclusion of TracFone results;

•

•

•

an  increase  of  $1.5  billion  driven  by  a  higher  volume  of  wireless  devices  sold,  primarily  related  to  a  higher  rate  of
upgrades; and
an increase of $1.0 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•

•

•

an increase in personnel costs of $1.3 billion primarily due to the inclusion of TracFone results and increased third-party
employee costs due to contracted services;
an  increase  in  provision  for  credit  losses  of  $745  million  driven  by  increased  device  payment  loan  volume  and  an
increase in the expected loss rate primarily as a result of the change in device payment plan terms to 36 months, as
well as actions taken in prior years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and
an  increase  in  advertising  expense  of  $454  million  primarily  due  to  the  inclusion  of  TracFone  results  and  brand
marketing, including the launch of the 5G Ultra campaign in early 2022.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation  and  amortization  expense  increased  during  2022  compared  to  2021,  driven  by  the  change  in  the  mix  of  total
Verizon depreciable and amortizable assets and Consumer's usage of those assets.

Business's total operating revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021, as a result of an increase in Small and Medium
Business revenue, partially offset by decreases in Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other and Wholesale revenues.

Small and Medium Business

Small  and  Medium  Business  offers  wireless  services  and  equipment,  conferencing  services,  tailored  voice  and  networking
products,  Fios  services,  Internet  Protocol  (IP)  networking,  advanced  voice  solutions  and  security  and  managed  information
technology  services  to  our  U.S.-based  small  and  medium  businesses  that  do  not  meet  the  requirements  to  be  categorized  as
Global Enterprise, as described below.

Small and Medium Business revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•

•

•

an  increase  in  wireless  equipment  revenue  of  $507  million  driven  by  a  higher  volume  of  devices  sold  and  a  shift  to
higher priced equipment in the mix of devices sold, partially offset by an increase in promotions;
an increase in wireless service revenue of $395 million primarily driven by an increase in the amount of wireless retail
postpaid connections as well as the economic adjustment charge that took effect in the second quarter of 2022; and
a decrease of $85 million related to the loss of voice and DSL service connections.

Fios revenues totaled $1.0 billion, which represents an increase of $41 million during 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was
primarily related to increases in total connections, as well as increased demand for higher broadband speeds.

Global Enterprise

Global  Enterprise  offers  services  to  large  businesses,  which  are  identified  based  on  their  size  and  volume  of  business  with
Verizon, as well as non-U.S. public sector customers.

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                32

Global Enterprise revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•

•
•

•

•

a  decrease  of  $544  million  in  networking  revenue  and  traditional  data  and  voice  communication  services  related  to
secular pressures in the marketplace;
a decrease of $118 million due to lower FUSF volume and rate along with resulting surcharges;
an  increase  of  $117  million  in  wireless  equipment  revenue  driven  by  a  shift  to  higher  priced  equipment  in  the  mix  of
devices sold and higher volume of devices sold;
an increase of $89 million in wireless service revenue primarily driven by an increase in the amount of wireless retail
postpaid connections as well as the economic adjustment charge that took effect in the second quarter of 2022; and
an increase of $34 million in customer premise equipment primarily due to higher volumes.

Public Sector and Other

Public  Sector  and  Other  offers  wireless  products  and  services  as  well  as  wireline  connectivity  and  managed  solutions  to  U.S.
federal,  state  and  local  governments  and  educational  institutions.  These  services  include  business  services  and  connectivity
similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case, with features and pricing designed to address the
needs of governments and educational institutions.

Public Sector and Other revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•

•

a  decrease  of  $169  million  in  networking  revenue  and  traditional  data  and  voice  communication  services  related  to
secular pressures in the marketplace; and
a decrease of $44 million related to lower FUSF volume and rate along with resulting surcharges.

Wholesale

Wholesale  offers  wireline  communications  services  including  data,  voice,  local  dial  tone  and  broadband  services  primarily  to
local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers.

Wholesale revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to:

•

a decrease of $113 million related to declines in traditional voice communication and network connectivity as a result of
technology substitution and rationalization of international traffic, as well as a decrease in core data.

Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets

During  2022  and  2021,  we  recorded  pre-tax  amortization  expense  of  $826  million  and  $594  million,  respectively,  related  to
acquired intangible assets.

Severance, Pension and Benefits Charges (Credits)

During 2022, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur,
we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $1.7 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits
were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of
$7.0 billion due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans
($4.1  billion)  and  postretirement  benefit  plans  ($2.9  billion)  from  a  weighted-average  of  2.9%  at  December  31,  2021  to  a
weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022, a charge of $5.5 billion due to the difference between our estimated and our
actual  return  on  assets  and  a  credit  of  $206  million  due  to  other  actuarial  assumption  adjustments.  During  2022,  we  also
recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $304 million, related to involuntary separations under our existing plans, in Selling,
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income.

During 2021, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur,
we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.4 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits
were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of
$1.1 billion due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans
and  postretirement  benefit  plans  from  a  weighted-average  of  2.6%  at  December  31,  2020  to  a  weighted-average  of  2.9%  at
December 31, 2021, a credit of $847 million due to the difference between our estimated and our actual return on assets and a
credit  of  $453  million  due  to  other  actuarial  assumption  adjustments.  During  2021,  we  also  recorded  net  pre-tax  severance
charges of $209 million related to voluntary separations under our existing plans in Selling, general and administrative expense
in our consolidated statement of income.

Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion of the pension and benefits
charges (credits) in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.

See  Note  11  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional  information  related  to  severance,  pension  and  benefits
charges (credits).

Early Debt Redemption Costs

During 2022, we recorded pre-tax early debt redemption costs of $1.2 billion primarily in connection with tender offers.

During 2021, we recorded pre-tax early debt redemption costs of $3.5 billion in connection with tender offers, the redemptions of
securities issued by Verizon and open market repurchases of various Company and subsidiary notes.

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our early debt redemptions.

Net Gain from Disposition of Asset and Business

During 2021, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $837 million, in connection with the sale of an investment and the sale of Verizon
Media.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Loss on Spectrum Licenses

During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $223 million as a result of signing two agreements to sell certain wireless licenses.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Operating Environment and Trends

The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has
eliminated  many  of  the  traditional  distinctions  among  wireless,  cable,  internet  and  local  and  long  distance  communication
services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional
participants  seek  increased  market  share.  Our  high-quality  customer  base  and  networks  differentiate  us  from  our  competitors
and  give  us  the  ability  to  plan  and  manage  through  changing  economic  and  competitive  conditions.  We  remain  focused  on
executing  on  the  fundamentals  of  the  business:  maintaining  a  high-quality  customer  base,  delivering  strong  financial  and
operating results and strengthening our balance sheet. We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance while aggressively building
out our 5G network.

The  U.S.  wireless  market  has  achieved  a  high  penetration  of  smartphones,  which  reduces  the  opportunity  for  new  phone
connection growth for the industry. We expect future revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer

   35

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

relationships,  increasing  the  number  of  ways  customers  can  connect  with  wireless  networks  and  services  and  increasing  the
penetration  of  FWA  and  connected  devices  including  wearables,  tablets  and  IoT  devices. Although  certain  use  cases  for  5G
technologies  and  related  ecosystems  are  in  early  development  stages,  we  expect  this  technology  will  provide  a  significant
opportunity for growth in the coming years. With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against
other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service
providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers,
including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies, such as Comcast Corporation and Charter
Communications,  Inc.,  and  others.  We  face  competition  from  other  communications  and  technology  companies  seeking  to
increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in
addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms,
Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used
in lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to
see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed
wireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers.

With  respect  to  wireless  services  and  equipment,  pricing  plays  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the  wireless  competitive
landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best
available  value  for  the  price. As  the  demand  for  wireless  services  continues  to  grow,  wireless  service  providers  are  offering  a
range  of  service  plans  at  competitive  prices.  These  service  offerings  will  vary  from  time  to  time  based  on  customer  needs,
technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers.
In  addition,  aggressive  device  promotions  have  become  more  common  in  an  effort  to  gain  a  greater  share  of  subscribers
interested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers.

We  expect  future  service  revenue  growth  opportunities  to  arise  from  increased  access  revenue  as  customer  demand  for  5G
connectivity  continues  to  expand  and  customers  shift  to  higher  access  plans,  driven  in  part  by  attractive  bundled  content  with
premium  brands,  as  well  as  from  increased  connections  per  account.  Future  service  revenue  growth  opportunities  will  be
dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our
networks and services and the development of new ecosystems. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment
manufacturers,  offer  device  payment  options,  which  provide  customers  with  the  ability  to  pay  for  their  device  over  a  period  of
time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements.

Current and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic
and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top providers and
other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. We also face increasing competition from other
providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal providers.

In  addition,  companies  with  a  global  presence  are  increasingly  competing  with  us  in  our  wireline  services. A  relatively  small
number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise
market  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  global  wholesale  market.  We  compete  with  these  providers  for  large  contracts  to  provide
integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers. Many of these companies have strong market presence,
brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future
revenue growth.

Despite this challenging environment, we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services. We continue to
provide  network  reliability  and  offer  products,  which  include  fiber-optic  internet  access,  several  video  services,  and  voice
services.  Further,  we  will  continue  to  offer  our  business  and  government  customers  a  converged-enterprise  environment  for
voice and data services as well as more robust IP products and services, and advance our IoT strategies by leveraging business
models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity, platform and solution layers.

We  will  also  continue  to  focus  on  cost  efficiencies  to  allow  us  to  have  flexibility  to  adjust  to  changes  in  the  competitive  and
economic environments and increase shareholder value.

Macroeconomic Environment

In 2022, as a result of the inflationary environment in the U.S., we experienced increases in our direct costs, including electricity
and  other  energy-related  costs  for  our  network  operations,  and  transportation  and  labor  costs,  as  well  as  increased  interest
expenses related to rising interest rates. We believe that this inflationary environment and the resulting decline in real wages in
the  U.S.  are  altering  consumer  preferences,  and  causing  certain  consumers  to  become  more  price  conscious.  We  expect  the
inflationary  environment  and  the  resulting  pressures  to  continue  in  2023.  For  a  discussion  of  the  risks  relating  to  unfavorable
economic conditions and inflation to our business, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors.

2023 Connection Trends

In our Consumer segment, we expect to continue to attract new customers and maintain high-quality retail postpaid customers,
capitalizing on demand for data services and providing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives. We
expect that future connection growth will be driven by FWA, as well as smartphones, tablets and other connected devices such
as  wearables.  We  believe  the  combination  of  our  wireless  network  performance  and  service  offerings  provides  a  superior

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                36

customer  experience,  supporting  increased  penetration  of  data  services  and  the  continued  attraction  and  retention  of  higher
valued  retail  postpaid  connections.  For  our  prepaid  business,  we  expect  to  continue  to  operate  in  a  competitive  environment
while making investments to achieve long-term success in this space.

We expect to continue to grow our Fios internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service
areas, further supported by the demand for higher speed internet connections. At the same time, we expect accelerating fixed
wireless  access  connections  to  complement  strong  Fios  results  as  demand  for  broadband  services  continues  to  grow.  In  Fios
video, the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market.  Given these trends,
we provide standalone Fios internet plans in addition to the choice of Fios video or a streaming service provided by a partner. We
have experienced continuing access line and DSL losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secondary lines and
switched to alternative technologies such as wireless, Voice over Internet Protocol, and cable for voice and data services.

In our Business segment, we offer wireless products and services to business and government customers across the U.S. We
continue  to  grow  our  retail  connections  while  operating  in  a  highly  competitive  environment.  We  expect  that  this  connection
growth, combined with our industry-leading network assets, will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions, such as those
around security, advanced communications and professional services. We also expect to expand our existing services offered to
business customers through our Intelligent Edge Network, our multi-use platform.

In  addition,  in  both  our  Consumer  and  our  Business  segments,  we  expect  to  support  connection  growth  in  part  by  adding
capacity and further expanding our wireless coverage, and by continuing the build-out of our 5G network.

2023 Operating Revenue Trends

In  our  Consumer  segment,  we  expect  to  see  a  continuation  of  service  revenue  growth  in  2023  as  customers  shift  to  higher
access  plans  with  additional  services  and  increase  the  number  of  devices  they  connect  with  our  networks  and  services.  We
expect  continued  growth  in  wireless  service  revenue,  driven  by  migrations  to  higher  priced  plans,  increases  in  fixed  wireless
access connections, and the pricing actions implemented in the second quarter of 2022. We expect Fios revenue to benefit in
2023  as  growth  in  our  broadband  customer  base  and  increases  in  demand  for  higher  speed  internet  connections  offset  the
impact of the shift from the bundling of wireline services to standalone Internet service.

In our Business segment, we expect wireless revenue to expand, driven by growth from increases in wireless volumes and fixed
wireless  access  contributions.  We  expect  that  Fios,  through  increased  penetration,  will  also  contribute  to  revenue  growth  and
legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures.

2023 Operating Expense and Cash Flow from Operations Trends

We  expect  our  consolidated  operating  income  margin  and  adjusted  consolidated  EBITDA  margin  to  remain  strong  as  we
continue  to  drive  revenue  growth  and  undertake  initiatives  to  reduce  our  overall  cost  structure.  We  expect  that  our  ability  to
generate cash flows will benefit from our anticipated reduction in capital expenditures as we reach the end of our dedicated C-
Band spending program, as well as our actions to better monetize our assets which increase our return on invested capital. We
created the Verizon Global Services group, an organization that is expected to drive efficiencies by centralizing key functions and
strategically delivering key services across Verizon.

We create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions
that  support  continued  profitable  growth,  thereby  increasing  customer  satisfaction  and  usage  of  our  products  and  services.  In
addition,  we  have  used  our  cash  flows  to  maintain  and  grow  our  dividend  payout  to  shareholders.  Our  Board  of  Directors
increased the quarterly dividend by 2.0% during 2022, making this the sixteenth consecutive year in which we have raised our
dividend.

Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities
that will help us to grow the business, strengthen our balance sheet, acquire spectrum licenses (see "Cash Flows from Investing
Activities"), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock (see
"Cash Flows from Financing Activities").

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We  use  the  net  cash  generated  from  our  operations  to  fund  expansion  and  modernization  of  our  networks,  service  and  repay
external  financing,  pay  dividends,  invest  in  new  businesses  and  spectrum  and,  when  appropriate,  buy  back  shares  of  our
outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from external financing
arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance is $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both
domestically  and  internationally,  and  are  invested  to  maintain  principal  and  provide  liquidity.  See  "Market  Risk"  for  additional
information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.

   37

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

We expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt
or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, or to maintain an appropriate capital
structure  to  ensure  our  financial  flexibility.  Our  external  financing  arrangements  include  credit  facilities  and  other  bank  lines  of
credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity  securities,
U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain
receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.

Capital Expenditures

Our  2023  capital  program  includes  capital  to  fund  advanced  networks  and  services,  including  expanding  our  core  networks,
adding capacity and density to our 5G network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying
C-Band,  transforming  our  structure  to  deploy  the  Intelligent  Edge  Network  while  reducing  the  cost  to  deliver  services  to  our
customers, and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies. We expect that our network architecture will simplify
operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology, and
create new enterprise opportunities in the business market. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2023 capital program to be
between  $18.25  billion  and  $19.25  billion,  inclusive  of  the  final  $1.75  billion  of  the  incremental  $10  billion  related  to  our
accelerated C-Band deployment program.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

We have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements
from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022:

•

Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $149.4 billion, of which $9.3 billion are expected to be due
within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $73.6 billion, of which $5.6 billion, are expected to be due
within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt
issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

•  Operating  lease  obligations  of  $29.8  billion  and  Finance  lease  obligations  of  $1.8  billion,  of  which  $4.6  billion  and
$586 million, respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. In addition, Verizon has an obligation
of  $675  million  representing  future  minimum  payments  under  the  sublease  arrangement  for  our  cell  towers,  of  which
$297 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.

•  Unconditional  purchase  obligations,  with  terms  in  excess  of  one  year,  amount  to  $24.5  billion,  of  which  $9.4  billion  is
expected  to  be  due  within  the  next  twelve  months.  Items  included  in  unconditional  purchase  obligations  are  primarily
commitments  to  purchase  network  equipment,  software  and  services,  content,  marketing  services  and  other  items
which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated
purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase
products  and  services  as  needed  with  no  firm  commitment.  See  Note  16  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for
additional information.
Estimated  commitments  for  our  allocable  share  of  clearing  costs  incurred  by,  and  incentive  payments  due  to,  the
incumbent  license  holders  associated  with  C-Band  wireless  spectrum  acquired  under  Auction  107.  The  remaining
commitment is estimated to be $4.8 billion, all of which is expected to be due within the next twelve months.

•

•  Other long-term liabilities, including current maturities, of $4.1 billion, of which $827 million is expected to be due within
the next twelve months. Other long-term liabilities represent estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan
contributions.  Qualified  pension  plan  contributions  include  estimated  minimum  funding  contributions.  We  expect  that
there will be no required pension funding through 2026, subject to changes in market conditions. Postretirement benefit
payments include future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based
on  changes  to  assumptions  and  future  plan  performance,  which  could  impact  the  timing  and/or  amounts  of  these
payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts.

•  We  are  not  able  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  when  the  unrecognized  tax  benefits  balance  of  $2.8  billion  and
related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective taxing authorities until the related tax audits are further
developed or resolved. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

decreased by $2.4 billion during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher device payment receivables as our device
payment portfolio increased over the comparative period, which was partially due to the change in device payment plan terms to
36  months.  This  decrease  was  further  driven  by  a  decrease  in  earnings.  We  expect  to  make  approximately  $200  million  of
discretionary pension contributions in 2023. Additionally, we expect that there will be no required pension funding through 2026,
subject to changes in market conditions.

Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities

Capital Expenditures

Capital  expenditures  continue  to  relate  primarily  to  the  use  of  capital  resources  to  increase  the  operating  efficiency  and
productivity  of  our  networks,  maintain  our  existing  infrastructure,  facilitate  the  introduction  of  new  products  and  services  and
enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges.

Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were $23.1 billion and $20.3 billion for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capital
expenditures  increased  approximately  $2.8  billion  during  2022,  compared  to  2021,  primarily  due  to  accelerating  our  5G
technology deployment. See "Global Network and Technology" for more details.

Acquisitions of Wireless Licenses

In February 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction, Auction 107, for mid-band spectrum
known as C-Band. During 2021, we paid approximately $45.9 billion for spectrum licenses in connection with this auction and
related costs, of which $1.3 billion was primarily paid for certain obligations related to projected clearing costs. During 2022, we
made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing costs associated
with the auction.

In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain
markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022, Verizon made payments of
approximately $310 million associated with these agreements.

During 2022 and 2021, we recorded capitalized interest related to wireless licenses of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.

During 2022 and 2021, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of an
insignificant amount and $95 million, respectively.

Cash Received (Paid) Related to Acquisitions of Businesses, Net of Cash Acquired

In September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire TracFone, a provider of prepaid and value mobile services
in  the  U.S.  The  transaction  closed  on  November  23,  2021  (the Acquisition  Date).  The  aggregate  cash  consideration  paid  by
Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $3.6 billion, net of cash acquired, approximately 57.6 million shares
of  our  common  stock  valued  at  approximately  $3.0  billion,  and  up  to  an  additional  $650  million  in  future  cash  contingent
consideration. During 2022, Verizon received net cash proceeds of $248 million for the final settlement of working capital, which
was included in our consideration as of the Acquisition Date. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

In  October  2020,  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  to  acquire  certain  assets  of  Bluegrass  Cellular  (Bluegrass),  a  rural
wireless  operator  serving  central  Kentucky.  The  transaction  closed  in  March  2021.  The  aggregate  cash  consideration  paid  by
Verizon at the closing of the transaction was approximately $412 million, net of cash acquired.

During  2022  and  2021,  we  completed  various  other  acquisitions  for  cash  consideration  of  an  insignificant  amount  and
approximately $51 million, respectively.

See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for information on our acquisitions.

Collateral Payments Related to Derivative Contracts, Net of Repayments

During 2022 and 2021, we made payments of $2.3 billion and an insignificant amount, respectively, of derivative collateral, net of
repayments. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Proceeds from Disposition of Business

During 2021, we received cash proceeds of $4.1 billion, net of cash transferred, in connection with the sale of Verizon Media.
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Other, Net

During 2021, we received cash of $321 million in connection with the settlement of a note receivable related to TracFone and net
cash proceeds of $98 million in connection with the sale of an investment.

Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities

We  seek  to  maintain  a  mix  of  fixed  and  variable  rate  debt  to  lower  borrowing  costs  within  reasonable  risk  parameters  and  to
protect  against  earnings  and  cash  flow  volatility  resulting  from  changes  in  market  conditions.  During  2022,  net  cash  used  in
financing activities was $8.5 billion. During 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $8.3 billion.

2022

During 2022, our net cash used in financing activities of $8.5 billion was primarily driven by $13.6 billion used for repayments,
redemptions  and  repurchases  of  long-term  borrowings  (secured  and  unsecured)  as  well  as  finance  lease  obligations,
$10.8 billion used for dividend payments and $2.1 billion used for other financing activities. These cash flows used in financing
activities  were  partially  offset  by  $17.8  billion  provided  by  proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings,  which  included  $10.7  billion  of
proceeds from our asset-backed debt transactions.

Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2022, our total debt decreased to $150.6 billion compared to $150.9 billion at December 31, 2021. Our effective
interest  rate  was  3.7%  and  3.6%  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  We  have  entered  into
interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt, managing our exposure to changes in interest rates.
See also "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

At  December  31,  2022,  approximately  $34.0  billion,  or  22.5%,  of  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  our  total  debt  portfolio
consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on
our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of
foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

Verizon may acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates through open market purchases, redemptions, privately
negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Verizon may from
time to time determine, for cash or other consideration.

Other, Net

Other,  net  financing  activities  during  2022  includes  the  cash  consideration  payments  to  acquire  additional  interests  in  certain
controlled  wireless  partnerships  and  early  debt  redemption  costs.  See  Note  14  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for
additional information on noncontrolling interests. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information
on the early debt redemption costs.

Dividends

The Board of Directors of the Company assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such
factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third
quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.0% to $0.6525 from $0.6400 per share in
the  preceding  quarter.  This  is  the  sixteenth  consecutive  year  that  Company’s  Board  of  Directors  has  approved  a  quarterly
dividend increase.

As  in  prior  periods,  dividend  payments  were  a  significant  use  of  capital  resources.  During  2022,  we  paid  $10.8  billion  in
dividends.

2021

During  2021,  our  net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  of  $8.3  billion  was  primarily  driven  by  $41.4  billion  provided  by
proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings,  which  included  $8.4  billion  of  proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions.  These
cash  flows  provided  by  financing  activities  were  partially  offset  by  $18.9  billion  used  for  repayments,  redemptions  and
repurchases  of  long-term  borrowings  (secured  and  unsecured)  as  well  as  finance  lease  obligations,  $10.4  billion  used  for
dividend payments and $3.8 billion used for other financing activities.

Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2021, our total debt was $150.9 billion, and during the year ended December 31, 2021, our effective interest
rate  was  3.6%.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  total  debt  portfolio  consisted  of  fixed  rate  indebtedness,  therefore,  changes  in
interest rates did not have a material effect on our interest payments. See "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                40

At  December  31,  2021,  approximately  $33.5  billion,  or  22.2%,  of  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  our  total  debt  portfolio
consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on
our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of
foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

Other, Net

Other,  net  financing  activities  during  2021  includes  $320  million  in  payments  related  to  vendor  financing  arrangements,
$161  million  in  postings  of  derivative  collateral  and  early  debt  redemption  costs.  See  Note  15  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements for additional information on the early debt redemption costs.

Dividends

During the third quarter of 2021, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.0% to $0.6400 per share.

As  in  prior  periods,  dividend  payments  were  a  significant  use  of  capital  resources.  During  2021,  we  paid  $10.4  billion  in
dividends.

Asset-Backed Debt

As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $20.0 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-
Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks
and their conduit facilities (collectively, the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each,
an  ABS  Entity  or  collectively,  the  ABS  Entities)  issue  the  debt  or  are  otherwise  party  to  the  transaction  documentation  in
connection  with  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions.  Under  the  terms  of  our  asset-backed  debt,  Cellco  Partnership  (Cellco),  a
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  and  certain  other  Company  affiliates  (collectively,  the  Originators)  transfer  device
payment plan agreement receivables and certain other receivables (collectively referred to as certain receivables) to one of the
ABS  Entities,  which  in  turn  transfers  such  receivables  to  another ABS  Entity  that  issues  the  debt.  Verizon  entities  retain  the
equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to
make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related payments and expenses.

Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred receivables and future collections on such receivables. These receivables
transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of
asset-backed  debt  and  expenses  related  thereto,  payments  to  the  Originators  in  respect  of  additional  transfers  of  certain
receivables,  and  other  obligations  arising  from  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions,  and  will  not  be  available  to  pay  other
obligations  or  claims  of  Verizon’s  creditors  until  the  associated  asset-backed  debt  and  other  obligations  are  satisfied.  The
Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do
not  have  any  recourse  to  Verizon  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  debt.  Under  a  parent  support
agreement, the Company has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS
Entities.

Cash collections on the receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be
placed  into  segregated  accounts.  Deposits  to  the  segregated  accounts  are  considered  restricted  cash  and  are  included  in
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

Proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions  are  reflected  in  Cash  flows  from  financing  activities  in  our  consolidated
statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued is included in Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our
consolidated balance sheets.

(1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it
permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the
issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no drawings against the $9.5 billion revolving credit
facility since its inception.

(2) During 2022 and 2021, we drew down $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, from these facilities. Borrowings under certain
of  these  facilities  are  amortized  semi-annually  in  equal  installments  up  to  the  applicable  maturity  dates.  Maturities  reflect

   41

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot
be reborrowed.

Common Stock

Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans.
During both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we issued 2.1 million shares of common stock from treasury stock,
which had aggregate values of $91 million.

In connection with our acquisition of TracFone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of common stock
from  treasury  stock  valued  at  approximately  $3.0  billion.  See  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional
information.

In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million
shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million,
or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. The program permits Verizon to
repurchase shares over time, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs.
There were no repurchases of common stock during 2022 and 2021 under our authorized share buyback program.

Credit Ratings

Verizon’s credit ratings did not change in 2022 or 2021.

Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold
securities. A  securities  rating  is  subject  to  revision  or  withdrawal  at  any  time  by  the  assigning  rating  organization.  Each  rating
should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Covenants

Our  credit  agreements  contain  covenants  that  are  typical  for  large,  investment  grade  companies.  These  covenants  include
requirements  to  pay  interest  and  principal  in  a  timely  fashion,  pay  taxes,  maintain  insurance  with  responsible  and  reputable
insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain
our  properties,  provide  financial  and  other  reports  to  our  lenders,  limit  pledging  and  disposition  of  assets  and  mergers  and
consolidations, and other similar covenants.

We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.

Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 totaled $2.6 billion, a $316 million decrease compared to December 31,
2021, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.

Restricted cash at December 31, 2022 totaled $1.5 billion, a $266 million increase compared to restricted cash at December 31,
2021,  primarily  related  to  cash  collections  on  certain  receivables  that  are  required  at  certain  specified  times  to  be  placed  into
segregated  accounts.  The  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  the  completion  of  asset-backed  debt  transactions  during  the  year
ended December 31, 2022.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when
viewed  with  our  GAAP  results,  provides  management,  investors  and  other  users  of  our  financial  information  with  a  more
complete  understanding  of  factors  and  trends  affecting  our  cash  flows.  Free  cash  flow  is  calculated  by  subtracting  capital
expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative
measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the
fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does
not  incorporate  payments  made  on  finance  lease  obligations  or  cash  payments  for  business  acquisitions  or  wireless  licenses.
Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

The  decrease  in  free  cash  flow  during  2022  is  a  reflection  of  the  decrease  in  operating  cash  flows,  as  well  as  the  increase  in
capital expenditures, both of which are discussed above.

Employee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions

Employer Contributions

We  operate  numerous  qualified  and  nonqualified  pension  plans  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans.  These  plans  primarily
relate to our domestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2022 or 2021.
During 2022 and 2021, we made contributions of $53 million and $58 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively.

Our overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into
consideration  risk  and  return.  In  an  effort  to  reduce  the  risk  of  our  portfolio  strategy  and  better  align  assets  with  liabilities,  we
have  adopted  a  liability  driven  pension  strategy  that  seeks  to  better  match  the  interest  rate  sensitivity  of  the  liability  hedging
assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline
at a time when liabilities increase (referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and
its  participants  and  beneficiaries.  Over  time,  as  the  asset  allocation  shifts  to  more  liability  hedging  assets,  this  strategy  will
generally  result  in  lower  expected  asset  returns.  In  2023,  we  expect  discretionary  qualified  pension  plan  contributions  to  be
approximately $200 million and nonqualified pension plan contributions to be insignificant.

Contributions  to  our  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  generally  relate  to  payments  for  benefits  on  an  as-incurred  basis  since
these  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  do  not  have  funding  requirements  similar  to  the  pension  plans.  We  contributed  $692
million  and  $885  million  to  our  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  in  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  Contributions  to  our  other
postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $820 million in 2023.

Leasing Arrangements

See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to leasing arrangements.

Guarantees

We  guarantee  the  debentures  of  our  operating  telephone  company  subsidiaries.  See  Note  7  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements for additional information.

In  connection  with  the  execution  of  agreements  for  the  sale  of  businesses  and  investments,  Verizon  ordinarily  provides
representations  and  warranties  to  the  purchasers  pertaining  to  a  variety  of  nonfinancial  matters,  such  as  ownership  of  the
securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As  of  December  31,  2022,  letters  of  credit  totaling  approximately  $834  million,  which  were  executed  in  the  normal  course  of
business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16 to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Other Future Obligations

During  2022,  Verizon  entered  into  four  renewable  energy  purchase  agreements  (REPAs)  with  third  parties,  in  addition  to  20
signed in previous years. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Under the REPAs, we
plan to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 3.0 gigawatts of capacity across multiple states, including Arizona, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Critical Accounting Estimates

A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as follows:

Wireless Licenses and Goodwill

Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill
are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in
the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim
period suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent
appropriate  marketplace  considerations  as  of  the  valuation  date. Although  we  use  consistent  methodologies  in  developing  the
assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions
are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be
changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market
participant  assumptions,  comparable  benchmark  companies  and  related  multiples  and  discount  rates,  which  could  result  in
different  fair  value  estimates.  Significant  and  adverse  changes  to  any  one  or  more  of  the  above-noted  estimates  and
assumptions  could  result  in  an  impairment  to  our  wireless  licenses  and  goodwill  impairment  for  one  or  more  of  our  reporting
units.

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Wireless Licenses

The  carrying  value  of  our  wireless  licenses  was  approximately  $149.8  billion  as  of  December  31,  2022.  We  aggregate  our
wireless  licenses  into  one  single  unit  of  accounting,  as  we  utilize  our  wireless  licenses  on  an  integrated  basis  as  part  of  our
nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum
to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other
factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.

We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have
the  option  to  first  perform  a  qualitative  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment
test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment  in  any  period  and  proceed  directly  to  performing  the
quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our
qualitative assessment we considered several factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business,
macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including
industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected
financial  performance  of  our  combined  wireless  business  as  a  whole,  as  well  as  other  factors  including  the  result  of  our  last
quantitative  assessment.  Our  annual  impairment  test  in  2022  indicated  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  our
wireless licenses remained above their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment, which indicated that the fair value of our
wireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. Our quantitative
impairment  assessment  consisted  of  comparing  the  estimated  fair  value  of  our  aggregate  wireless  licenses  to  the  aggregated
carrying  amount  as  of  the  test  date.  Under  our  quantitative  assessment,  we  estimated  the  fair  value  of  our  wireless  licenses
using  the  Greenfield  approach.  The  Greenfield  approach  is  an  income  based  valuation  approach  that  values  the  wireless
licenses  by  calculating  the  cash  flow  generating  potential  of  a  hypothetical  start-up  company  that  goes  into  business  with  no
assets  except  the  wireless  licenses  to  be  valued.  A  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  is  used  to  estimate  what  a  marketplace
participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were
required to make significant estimates about future cash flows and profitability specifically associated with our wireless licenses,
an  appropriate  discount  rate  based  on  the  risk  associated  with  those  estimated  cash  flows  and  assumed  terminal  value  and
growth  rates.  We  considered  current  and  expected  future  economic  conditions,  current  and  expected  availability  of  wireless
network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating
future cash flows and profitability. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or
expected  return,  that  a  marketplace  participant  would  have  required  as  of  the  valuation  date.  We  developed  the  discount  rate
based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. Accordingly,
our  discount  rate  incorporated  our  estimate  of  the  expected  return  a  marketplace  participant  would  have  required  as  of  the
valuation  date,  including  the  risk  premium  associated  with  the  current  and  expected  economic  conditions  as  of  the  valuation
date. The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate.

Goodwill

At December 31, 2022, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.7 billion, of which $21.1 billion was in our Consumer
reporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit.

To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect not to conduct the qualitative
assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires
the fair value of each reporting unit to be assessed. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessments at least every
three years.

Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from
the  last  quantitative  test  and  the  excess  of  fair  value  over  carrying  value  from  this  test,  macroeconomic  conditions  (including
changes  in  interest  rates  and  discount  rates),  industry  and  market  considerations  (including  industry  revenue  and  EBITDA
margin  results,  projections  and  recent  merger  and  acquisition  activity),  the  recent  and  projected  financial  performance  of  the
reporting unit, as well as other factors.

Under the quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted
cash  flow  method,  as  a  form  of  the  income  approach.  The  market  approach  includes  the  use  of  comparative  multiples  to
complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-
projected  cash  flows  and  a  terminal  value.  The  terminal  value  represents  the  expected  normalized  future  cash  flows  of  the
reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based
on  the  sum  of  the  present  value  of  the  cash  flows  from  the  discrete  period  and  the  present  value  of  the  terminal  value.  The
discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as
of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model.

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                44

The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of
key  strategic  revenue  and  cost  initiatives,  as  well  as  revenue  and  EBITDA  growth  relative  to  history  and  market  trends  and
expectations.  The  market  multiples  approach  incorporated  significant  judgment  involved  in  the  selection  of  comparable  public
company  multiples  and  benchmarks.  The  selection  of  companies  and  multiples  was  influenced  by  differences  in  growth  and
profitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse
change in one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022,  we  performed  a  qualitative  impairment  assessment  for  our  Consumer  reporting  unit.  Our
qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given it
has  continued  to  experience  increased  market  pressures  resulting  in  lower  than  expected  revenues  and  earnings  that  may
continue  to  persist  over  the  near  term.  At  the  goodwill  impairment  measurement  date  of  October  31,  2022,  our  Business
reporting  unit  had  a  fair  value  that  exceeded  its  carrying  amount  by  approximately  8%  and,  therefore,  did  not  result  in  an
impairment.  We  do  not  anticipate  reasonable  changes  in  significant  estimates  to  change  the  outcome  of  the  quantitative
impairment assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis points, or if the discount rate
increased by 50 basis points, the fair value of our Business reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value. However, as a
result of our 2022 goodwill assessment, management believes there is an increasing risk that our Business reporting unit may be
required  to  recognize  an  impairment  charge  in  the  future.  See  Note  4  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional
information.

A  projected  sustained  decline  in  a  reporting  unit's  revenues  and  earnings  could  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  its  fair
value  and  may  result  in  impairment  charges.  Such  a  decline  could  be  driven  by,  among  other  things:  (1)  decreases  in  sales
volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in
achieving  the  goals  in  strategic  initiatives.  Also,  adverse  changes  to  macroeconomic  factors,  such  as  increases  in  long-term
interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit.

At December 31, 2021, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $28.6 billion, of which $21.0 billion was in our Consumer
reporting unit and $7.5 billion was in our Business reporting unit. We performed quantitative impairment assessments for both
our Consumer and Business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2021. At the goodwill impairment measurement date of
October  31,  2021,  our  quantitative  assessments  indicated  that  the  fair  values  for  our  Consumer  and  Business  reporting  units
were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, did not result in impairment.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

We maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit
plans. Benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination
of  the  substantive  plan  and  health  care  trend  rates  are  periodically  updated  and  impact  the  amount  of  benefit  plan  income,
expense,  assets  and  obligations.  Changes  to  one  or  more  of  these  assumptions  could  significantly  impact  our  accounting  for
pension and other postretirement benefits.

In  determining  pension  and  other  postretirement  obligations,  the  weighted-average  discount  rate  was  selected  to  approximate
the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2022. The
bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefit payments are expected to occur, were
non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $300 million par outstanding). Bond yields are
subject  to  uncertainty  for  a  number  of  reasons  including  corporate  performance,  credit  rating  downgrades  and  upgrades,
government fiscal policy decisions, and general market volatility. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets used in
determining Verizon’s pension and other postretirement obligations are based on expectations for future investment returns for
the plans’ asset allocation. The rates are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance, credit
ratings, monetary policy, inflation, exchange rates, investor behavior and general market volatility.

A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets on the benefit
obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan
assets as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is
provided  in  the  table  below.  The  amounts  in  the  table  below  related  to  discount  rate  changes  are  gross  impacts  on  benefit
obligations and expense, and do not reflect changes in asset values as a result of interest rate changes, for which our pension
plan is highly hedged.

In  addition  to  our  liability  hedging  assets,  we  also  employ  an  interest  rate  hedging  strategy  to  further  minimize  the  impact  of
discount  rate  changes  on  the  funded  ratio  of  the  pension  plan.  While  the  target  hedge  ratio  varies  depending  on  the  funded
status of the plan and the level of interest rates, the target hedge ratio was greater than 80% at December 31, 2022, significantly
limiting volatility.

The  annual  measurement  date  for  both  our  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefits  is  December  31.  We  use  the  full  yield
curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits.
The  full  yield  curve  approach  refines  our  estimate  of  interest  cost  by  applying  the  individual  spot  rates  from  a  yield  curve
composed  of  the  rates  of  return  on  several  hundred  high-quality  fixed  income  corporate  bonds  available  at  the  measurement
date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a
more precise estimate of interest cost.

See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Income Taxes

Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in
the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and
rates,  acquisitions  and  dispositions  of  businesses  and  non-recurring  items. As  a  global  commercial  enterprise,  our  income  tax
rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of
deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to
be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires
the  use  of  a  two-step  approach  for  recognizing  and  measuring  tax  benefits  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  We
review  and  adjust  our  liability  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  based  on  our  best  judgment  given  the  facts,  circumstances  and
information  available  at  each  reporting  date.  To  the  extent  that  the  final  outcome  of  these  tax  positions  is  different  than  the
amounts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and
penalties  accrued  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  income  tax  expense. Actual  tax  payments  may  materially  differ  from
estimated  liabilities  as  a  result  of  changes  in  tax  laws  as  well  as  unanticipated  transactions  impacting  related  income  tax
balances. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Our Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record property,
plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life
of  the  assets.  The  estimated  useful  life  is  subject  to  change  due  to  a  variety  of  factors  such  as  change  in  asset  capacity  or
performance,  technical  obsolescence,  market  expectations  and  competition  impacts.  In  connection  with  our  ongoing  review  of
the  estimated  useful  lives  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  during  2022,  we  determined  that  the  estimated  useful  life  of  our
property,  plant  and  equipment  would  remain  unchanged.  We  expect  that  a  one  year  increase  in  estimated  useful  lives  of  our
property, plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2022 depreciation expense of $2.2 billion and that a one year
decrease would result in an increase of approximately $3.5 billion in our 2022 depreciation expense.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered.
The  gross  amount  of  accounts  receivable  and  corresponding  allowance  for  credit  losses  are  presented  separately  in  the
consolidated  balance  sheets.  We  maintain  allowances  for  credit  losses  resulting  from  the  expected  failure  or  inability  of  our
customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based
on  management’s  expectation  of  the  asset’s  collectability.  The  allowance  is  based  on  multiple  factors  including  historical
experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic
conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’s expectations of conditions in the future, as applicable.
The impact of these factors on the allowance involves significant level of estimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance
for  credit  losses  is  based  on  management’s  assessment  of  the  collectability  of  assets  pooled  together  with  similar  risk
characteristics.

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                46

We  record  an  allowance  to  reduce  the  receivables  to  the  amount  that  is  expected  to  be  collectible.  For  device  payment  plan
agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model.
The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The  loss
rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and
used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. The
weighted-average expected loss rate increased 0.44% at December 31, 2022 as compared to at December 31, 2021. We expect
that  an  increase  or  decrease  of  0.25%  in  the  weighted-average  loss  rate  would  result  in  a  change  of  $111  million  in  the
allowance.

We  monitor  the  collectability  of  our  wireless  service  receivables  as  one  overall  pool.  Wireline  service  receivables  are
disaggregated  and  pooled  by  the  following  customer  groups:  consumer,  small  and  medium  business,  global  enterprise,  public
sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the
allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account
from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss
amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector
and  wholesale  wireline  receivables,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  based  on  historical  write-off  experience  and  individual
customer credit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above.

If there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from
those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the
adjustments are made. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Spectrum License Transactions

From  time  to  time,  we  enter  into  agreements  to  buy,  sell  or  exchange  spectrum  licenses.  We  believe  these  spectrum  license
transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient
use of spectrum.

In March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands
concluded. Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of
37 GHz and, to a lesser extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz licenses provided us with incentive
payments  that  were  applied  towards  the  purchase  price  of  spectrum  in  the  auction. The  value  of  the  licenses  won  by  Verizon
amounted to $3.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion was settled with the relinquished 39 GHz licenses.

In  February  2021,  the  FCC  concluded Auction  107  for  C-Band  wireless  spectrum.  Verizon  paid $45.5  billion  for  the  licenses  it
won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is
required  to  make  additional  payments  to  acquire  the  licenses.  The  payments  are  for  our  allocable  share  of  clearing  costs
incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be
$7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs.
During 2022, we made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing
costs. We expect to continue to make payments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024, which
we  expect  to  be  $4.8  billion.  These  payments  are  dependent  on  the  incumbent  license  holders  accelerated  clearing  of  the
spectrum for Verizon’s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders’ execution of
their clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. The carrying value
of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction,
including Verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders
associated  with  the  auction  that  we  are  obligated  to  pay  in  order  to  acquire  the  licenses,  as  well  as  capitalized  interest  to  the
extent qualifying activities have occurred.

In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain
markets  and  frequencies  ahead  of  the  previously  expected  December  2023  timeframe.  During  2022,  Verizon  incurred  costs
associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which $310 million was paid as of the year ended December
31,  2022.  This  early  clearance  accelerated  Verizon's  access  to  more  spectrum  in  a  number  of  key  markets  to  support  its  5G
technology deployment.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our spectrum license transactions.

TracFone Wireless, Inc.

In  September  2020,  we  entered  into  a  purchase  agreement  (TracFone  Purchase  Agreement)  with  América  Móvil  to  acquire
TracFone, a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021. In
accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  TracFone  Purchase  Agreement,  Verizon  acquired  all  of  TracFone's  outstanding  stock  in
exchange  for  approximately  $3.5  billion  in  cash,  net  of  cash  acquired  and  working  capital  and  other  adjustments,  57,596,544
shares of our common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash contingent

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of
the common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of
the contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $560 million calculated using a probability-weighted
discounted  cash  flow  model  and  significant  unobservable  inputs,  thus  representing  a  Level  3  measurement.  The  contingent
consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn
out period, as defined in the TracFone Purchase Agreement. During 2022, Verizon made payments of $188 million related to the
contingent consideration, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for
the  twelve  months  ended  December  31,  2022.  Payments  related  to  the  contingent  consideration  are  expected  to  continue
through  2024.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  the  fair  value  of  the  contingent  consideration  was  $317  million.  During  2022,  we
recorded  gains  of  $57  million  related  to  fair  value  adjustments  for  the  contingent  consideration  within  Selling,  general  and
administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. See Note 3 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.

Bluegrass Cellular

In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass, a rural wireless operator serving
central Kentucky. The transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of the
transaction  was  approximately  $412  million,  net  of  cash  acquired.  See  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for
additional information.

Verizon Media Divestiture

On  May  2,  2021,  Verizon  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  with  an  affiliate  of  Apollo  Global  Management  Inc.  (the  Apollo
Affiliate)  pursuant  to  which  we  agreed  to  sell  Verizon  Media  in  return  for  consideration  of  $4.3  billion  in  cash,  subject  to
customary adjustments, $750 million in non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate, and 10% of the
fully-diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate.

On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. As of the close of the transaction, cash proceeds, the fair value
of  the  non-convertible  preferred  limited  partnership  units  of  the  Apollo  Affiliate,  and  the  fair  value  of  10%  of  the  fully-diluted
common  limited  partnership  units  of  the  Apollo  Affiliate  were  $4.3  billion,  $496  million,  and  $124  million,  respectively.  We
recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $1.0 billion (after-tax $1.0 billion) in Selling general and administrative expense
in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $346 million of various
costs  associated  with  this  disposition  which  are  primarily  recorded  in  Selling  general  and  administrative  expense  in  our
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.

Other

From time to time, we enter into strategic agreements to acquire various other businesses and investments. See Note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

In connection with a non-strategic divestiture and other activity, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of an insignificant amount in our
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In December 2021, we completed the sale of an investment. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of
$131  million  in  Equity  in  earnings  (losses)  of  unconsolidated  businesses  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  for  the  year
ended December 31, 2021.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes,
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax
rates.  We  employ  risk  management  strategies,  which  may  include  the  use  of  a  variety  of  derivatives  including  cross  currency
swaps,  forward  starting  interest  rate  swaps,  interest  rate  swaps,  interest  rate  caps,  treasury  rate  locks  and  foreign  exchange
forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.

It is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary
to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed
and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow
volatility  resulting  from  changes  in  market  conditions.  We  do  not  hedge  our  market  risk  exposure  in  a  manner  that  would
completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings.

Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements
(ISDA  master  agreements)  and  credit  support  annex  (CSA)  agreements  which  provide  rules  for  collateral  exchange. The  CSA
agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based
upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair
value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                48

the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2022, we did
not hold any collateral. At December 31, 2022, we posted $2.3 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral
exchange agreements, which was recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31,
2021, we held and posted $0.1 billion and an insignificant amount, respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under
collateral  exchange  arrangements,  which  were  recorded  as  Other  current  liabilities  and  Prepaid  expenses  and  other,
respectively,  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet. While  we  may  be  exposed  to  credit  losses  due  to  the  nonperformance  of  our
counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect
on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 9 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio.

Interest Rate Risk

We  are  exposed  to  changes  in  interest  rates,  primarily  on  our  short-term  debt  and  the  portion  of  long-term  debt  that  carries
floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 74% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio
consisted of fixed-rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of
a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest  expense,
including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $420 million. The interest rates on
our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings.

Certain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. The U.S. dollar LIBOR rates utilized in these transactions will
cease  publication  after  June  30,  2023,  in  accordance  with  recent  U.S.  and  international  regulatory  guidance  for  reform.  The
consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our floating rate
debt or exposure under our interest rate derivative transactions. We do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position
given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt and taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging. In 2021, we
began utilizing interest rates that are linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the benchmark rate for various floating
rate transactions.

The  table  that  follows  summarizes  the  fair  values  of  our  long-term  debt,  including  current  maturities,  and  interest  rate  swap
derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these
financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivity analysis does not
include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in
market interest rates.

We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and
pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges
and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. At December 31, 2022, there was no amount related
to the fair value of the asset and the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $4.6 billion. At December 31, 2021, the fair
value of the asset and liability of these contracts was $473 million and $666 million, respectively. The increase in the fair value of
the liability of these contracts is primarily due to interest rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2022. At December
31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $26.1 billion and $19.8 billion, respectively.

Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps

We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to
interest rate changes on future forecasted transactions. At December 31, 2022, there was no amount related to the fair value of
the asset or liability of these contracts. At December 31, 2021, there was no amount related to the fair value of the asset and the
fair value of the liability of these contracts was $302 million. At December 31, 2022, there was no outstanding notional amount for
forward starting interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2021, the total notional amount of the forward starting interest rate swaps
was $1.0 billion.

Treasury Rate Locks

From time to time we enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk. There was no outstanding notional amount
for treasury rate locks at December 31, 2022 or 2021.

The  functional  currency  for  our  foreign  operations  is  primarily  the  local  currency.  The  translation  of  income  statement  and
balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are
included  in Accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Gains  and  losses  on  foreign  currency
transactions  are  recorded  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income. At  December  31,  2022,  our  primary  translation  exposure
was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar.

Cross Currency Swaps

We  have  entered  into  cross  currency  swaps  to  exchange  our  British  Pound  Sterling,  Euro,  Swiss  Franc,  Canadian  Dollar  and
Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the
impact  of  foreign  currency  transaction  gains  or  losses.  On  March  31,  2022,  we  voluntarily  elected  to  de-designate  our  cross
currency  swaps  previously  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  and  re-designated  the  swaps  as  fair  value  hedges.  Subsequently
executed  cross  currency  swaps  are  also  designated  as  fair  value  hedges.  The  fair  value  of  the  asset  of  these  contracts  was
$305 million and $589 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of
the liability of these contracts was $3.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional
amount of the cross currency swaps was $35.0 billion and $32.5 billion, respectively.

Foreign Exchange Forwards

We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply hedge
accounting. We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk
related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant. At December 31, 2021, the fair
value  of  the  asset  of  these  contracts  was  insignificant  and  there  was  no  amount  related  to  the  liability  of  these  contracts. At
December  31,  2022  and  2021,  the  total  notional  amount  of  the  foreign  exchange  forwards  was  $920  million  and  $932  million,
respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We  have  audited  Verizon  Communications  Inc.  and  subsidiaries’  (Verizon)  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of
December  31,  2022,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)  (the  COSO  criteria).  In  our  opinion,  Verizon
maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2022,  based  on  the
COSO criteria.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Verizon as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December
31,  2022,  and  the  related  notes  and  the  financial  statement  schedule  listed  in  the  Index  at  Item  15(a)  and  our  report  dated
February 10, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

Verizon’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  in  the  accompanying  Management's  Annual  Report  on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent
with  respect  to  Verizon  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all
material respects.

Our  audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A   company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted accounting principles. A  company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit
preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and
expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the
company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,
projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.:

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries (Verizon or
the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash
flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements").
In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  Verizon  at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)
(PCAOB), Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013
framework) and our report dated February 10, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  Verizon’s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on
Verizon’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to  be  independent  with  respect  to  Verizon  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error  or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial
statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that
are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective  or  complex  judgments.  The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a
whole,  and  we  are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separate  opinions  on  the  critical  audit
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Description of the
Matter

Valuation of Employee Benefit Obligations

The  Company  sponsors  several  pension  plans  and  other  post-employment  benefit  plans.  At
December  31,  2022,  the  Company’s  aggregate  defined  benefit  pension  obligation  was  $15.3  billion
and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $13.7 billion, resulting in an unfunded defined
benefit  pension  obligation  of  $1.6  billion.  Also,  at  December  31,  2022,  the  other  postretirement
benefits  obligation  was  approximately  $11.1  billion.  As  explained  in  Note  11  of  the  consolidated
financial  statements,  the  Company  updates  the  estimates  used  to  measure  employee  benefit
obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to reflect the actual
return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions.

Auditing  the  employee  benefit  obligations  was  complex  due  to  the  highly  judgmental  nature  of  the
actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rate, health care cost trends and per capita claims cost trends)
used  in  the  measurement  process.  These  assumptions  had  a  significant  effect  on  the  projected
benefit obligation.

How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit

We  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of
controls  over  the  employee  benefits  obligation  valuation  process.  For  example,  we  tested  controls
over  management’s  review  of  the  employee  benefit  obligation  calculations,  the  significant  actuarial
assumptions and the data inputs provided to the actuary.

To test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the
methodologies  used,  the  significant  actuarial  assumptions  discussed  above  and  the  underlying  data
used  by  the  Company.  We  compared  the  actuarial  assumptions  used  by  management  to  historical
trends, current economic factors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from
prior  year  due  to  the  change  in  service  cost,  interest  cost,  actuarial  gains  and  losses,  benefit
payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in
evaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and
duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit obligations. As part of
this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and compared the
current  year  benefits  paid  to  the  prior  year  projected  cash  flows.  To  evaluate  the  health  care  cost
trends and per capita claims cost trends, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating the
assumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available information,
and  whether  any  market  data  adjusted  for  entity-specific  adjustments  were  applied.  We  also  tested
the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  the  underlying  data,  including  the  participant  data  provided  to
management’s actuarial specialists.
Impairment Evaluation for Verizon Business Group Goodwill

At  December  31,  2022,  the  Company’s  goodwill  related  to  its  Verizon  Business  Group  (Business)
reporting unit was $7.5 billion and represented 2.0% of total assets. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of
the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at
the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The
impairment  test  compares  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  (calculated  using  a  combination  of  a
market approach and an income approach) to its carrying amount.

Auditing  management’s  goodwill  impairment  test  was  complex  and  highly  judgmental  due  to  the
inherent subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on
assumptions  about  future  conditions,  transactions,  or  events  whose  outcome  is  uncertain  and  will
therefore  be  subject  to  change  over  time.  In  particular,  the  fair  value  estimate  was  sensitive  to
significant assumptions such as the discount rate, revenue growth rate and earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins, which are affected by expected future market
or economic conditions.
We  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of
controls  over  the  Company’s  goodwill  impairment  review  process.  For  example,  we  tested  controls
over management’s review of the valuation models and the significant assumptions described above.

To  test  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  Company’s  Business  reporting  unit,  our  audit  procedures
included,  among  others,  assessing  the  suitability  and  application  of  the  valuation  methodologies
selected and evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above and underlying data used by the
Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current
industry  and  economic  trends,  market  information,  and  other  relevant  factors.  We  performed
sensitivity  analyses  of  significant  assumptions  to  determine  what  changes  in  assumptions  are
particularly sensitive when assessing the likelihood of impairment, or when calculating the amount of
an  impairment.  In  addition,  we  involved  a  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  the  evaluation  of  the
assumptions  and  other  relevant  information  that  are  most  significant  to  the  fair  value  estimate.  We
also  assessed  the  historical  accuracy  of  management’s  forecasts  of  financial  results  used  in
developing prior fair value estimates to assist in evaluating the reliability of the current forecasts.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries

Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Verizon  Communications  Inc.  (the  Company)  is  a  holding  company  that,  acting  through  its  subsidiaries  (together  with  the
Company,  collectively,  Verizon),  is  one  of  the  world’s  leading  providers  of  communications,  technology,  information  and
entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we
offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers’ demand
for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.

We  have  two  reportable  segments  that  we  operate  and  manage  as  strategic  business  units  - Verizon  Consumer  Group
(Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business).

Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless
services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand,
TracFone  Wireless,  Inc.  (TracFone)  brands  and  through  wholesale  and  other  arrangements.  We  also  provide  fixed  wireless
access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and
over  a  traditional  copper-based  network  to  customers  who  are  not  served  by  Fios.  Our  Consumer  segment's  wireless  and
wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access
from us on a wholesale basis.

Our  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  data,  video  and
conferencing  services,  corporate  networking  solutions,  security  and  managed  network  services,  local  and  long  distance  voice
services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband
through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and
wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world.

Consolidation

The method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated or equity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms
of  the  investments  that  explicitly  grant  or  suggest  evidence  of  control  or  influence  over  the  operations  of  the  investee.  The
consolidated  financial  statements  include  our  controlled  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  variable  interest  entities  (VIE)  where  we  are
deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  For  controlled  subsidiaries  that  are  not  wholly-owned,  the  noncontrolling  interests  are
included  in  Net  income  and  Total  equity.  Investments  in  businesses  that  we  do  not  control,  but  have  the  ability  to  exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments
are  included  in  Investments  in  unconsolidated  businesses  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets.  All  significant  intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Basis of Presentation

We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into
account  historical  and  forward-looking  factors  that  the  Company  believes  are  reasonable,  including  but  not  limited  to  public
health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related economic implications. Actual results could differ significantly from
those estimates.

Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant
and  equipment,  and  other  long-lived  assets,  the  incremental  borrowing  rate  for  the  lease  liability,  fair  value  measurements,
including  those  related  to  financial  instruments,  goodwill,  spectrum  licenses  and  intangible  assets,  unrecognized  tax  benefits,
valuation  allowances  on  tax  assets,  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  obligations,  contingencies  and  the  identification  and
valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations.

Revenue Recognition

We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and
through  the  sale  of  wireless  equipment.  These  services  include  a  variety  of  communication  and  connectivity  services  for  our
Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well
as  professional  and  integrated  managed  services  for  our  large  enterprises  and  government  customers.  We  account  for  these
revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606).

59

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

We  also  earn  revenues  that  are  not  accounted  for  under Topic  606  from  leasing  arrangements  (such  as  those  for  towers  and
equipment),  captive  reinsurance  arrangements  primarily  related  to  wireless  device  insurance  and  the  interest  on  equipment
financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.

Nature of Products and Services

Telecommunications

Service

We offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue
using  an  output  method,  either  as  the  service  allowance  units  are  used  or  as  time  elapses,  because  it  reflects  the  pattern  by
which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in
advance,  which  results  in  a  contract  liability.  See  Note  2  for  additional  information.  For  postpaid  plans,  where  monthly  usage
exceeds  the  allowance,  the  overage  usage  represents  options  held  by  the  customer  for  incremental  services  and  the  usage-
based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).

For our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed
one month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term
as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network
access  and  usage.  While  substantially  all  of  our  wireline  service  revenue  contracts  are  the  result  of  providing  access  to  our
networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and
recognized as the usage occurs.

Equipment

We sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized
when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to
offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless
device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans.

Under a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange
for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less).

Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note,
which  is  repaid  by  the  customer,  typically  over  a  36-month  term,  and  concurrently  enters  into  a  month-to-month  contract  for
wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the
customer  maintaining  service.  The  credits  are  included  in  the  transaction  price,  which  are  allocated  to  the  performance
obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.

A financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the
device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract
inception  upon  transfer  of  the  device  to  the  customer.  We  periodically  assess,  at  the  contract  level,  the  significance  of  the
financing  component  inherent  in  our  fixed-term  and  device  payment  plan  receivable  based  on  qualitative  and  quantitative
considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans,
the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes,
all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the
financing  component  in  our  existing  wireless  device  payments  and  fixed-term  contracts  sold  through  the  direct  channel  is  not
significant  and  therefore  is  not  accounted  for  separately.  See  Note  8  for  additional  information  on  the  interest  on  equipment
financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.

Wireless Contracts

For  our  wireless  contracts,  total  contract  revenue,  which  represents  the  transaction  price  for  wireless  service  and  wireless
equipment,  is  allocated  between  service  and  equipment  revenue  based  on  their  estimated  standalone  selling  prices.  We
estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase
discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-
month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is
procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted
by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have
to  pay  to  early  terminate  a  fixed-term  contract  or  billing  credits  that  would  cease  if  the  month-to-month  wireless  service  is
canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination
of the transaction price and related disclosures.

From time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade
to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in
good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

60

is  recognized  as  a  guarantee  liability  and  results  in  a  reduction  to  the  revenue  recognized  upon  the  sale  of  the  device.  The
guarantee liability was $54 million  and $77 million  at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total transaction price is
reduced  by  the  guarantee,  which  is  accounted  for  outside  the  scope  of  Topic  606,  and  the  remaining  transaction  price  is
allocated between the performance obligations within the contract.

Our fixed-term plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract
asset at the time of sale, which represents the recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed.

For our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the
determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability.

We may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for
as variable consideration when determining the transaction price, and accordingly we recognize revenue based on the estimated
amount  to  which  we  expect  to  be  entitled  after  considering  expected  returns.  Returns  and  credits  are  estimated  at  contract
inception  and  updated  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  as  additional  information  becomes  available.  We  also  may  provide
credits or incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration
when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.

Wireline Contracts

Total consideration for wireline services that are bundled in a single contract is allocated to each performance obligation based
on our standalone selling price for each service. While many contracts include one or more service performance obligations, the
revenue recognition pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the services are generally satisfied over the same
period of time. We estimate the standalone selling price to be the price of the services when sold on a standalone basis without
any promotional discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights
and obligations in our contract with customers such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-
term  contract.  The  assessment  of  these  legally  enforceable  rights  and  obligations  involves  judgment  and  impacts  our
determination of transaction price and related disclosures.

We  may  provide  performance-based  credits  or  incentives  on  our  products  and  services  for  contracts  with  our  Business
customers,  which  are  accounted  for  as  variable  consideration  when  estimating  the  transaction  price.  Credits  are  estimated  at
contract inception and are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.

Wireless and Wireline Contracts

For offers that include third-party providers, we evaluate whether we are acting as the principal or as the agent with respect to
the  goods  or  services  provided  to  the  customer.  This  principal-versus-agent  assessment  involves  judgment  and  focuses  on
whether  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  arrangement  indicate  that  the  goods  or  services  were  controlled  by  us  prior  to
transferring them to the customer. To evaluate if we have control, we consider various factors including whether we are primarily
responsible for fulfillment, bear risk of loss and have discretion over pricing.

Other

Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue is generated
by the display of graphical advertisements and other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated
when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on the search results page. The divested Verizon Media Group (Verizon
Media),  primarily  earned  revenue  through  display  advertising  on  Verizon  Media  properties,  as  well  as  on  third-party  properties
through  our  advertising  platforms,  search  advertising,  and  subscription  arrangements.  Revenue  for  display  and  search
advertising contracts is recognized as ads are delivered, while subscription contracts are recognized over time. We are generally
the  principal  in  transactions  carried  out  through  our  advertising  platforms,  and  therefore  report  gross  revenue  based  on  the
amount billed to our customers. The control and transfer of digital advertising inventory occurs in a rapid, real-time environment,
where our proprietary technology enables us to identify, enhance, verify and solely control digital advertising inventory that we
then sell to our customers. Our control is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers for fulfillment and
the fact that we can exercise a level of discretion over pricing. We completed the sale of Verizon Media on September 1, 2021.
See Note 3 for additional information on the sale of Verizon Media.

We  offer  telematics  services  including  smart  fleet  management  and  optimization  software.  Telematics  service  revenue  is
generated primarily through subscription contracts. We recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts.

We  report  taxes  collected  from  customers  on  behalf  of  governmental  authorities  on  revenue-producing  transactions  on  a  net
basis.

Maintenance and Repairs

We  charge  the  cost  of  maintenance  and  repairs,  including  the  cost  of  replacing  minor  items  not  constituting  substantial
betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs are incurred.

61

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Advertising Costs

Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general
and administrative expense in the periods in which they are incurred. See Note 15 for additional information.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where
appropriate,  diluted  earnings  per  common  share  include  the  dilutive  effect  of  shares  issuable  under  our  stock-based
compensation plans.

There were a total of approximately 1.9 million, 1.7 million and 2.0 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of
restricted  stock  units,  included  in  the  computation  of  diluted  earnings  per  common  share  for  the  years  ended  December  31,
2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

We  consider  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  an  original  maturity  of 90  days  or  less  when  purchased  to  be  cash  equivalents.
Cash  equivalents  are  stated  at  cost,  which  approximates  quoted  market  value  and  includes  amounts  held  in  money  market
funds.

Cash collections on the receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be
placed  into  segregated  accounts.  Deposits  to  the  segregated  accounts  are  considered  restricted  cash  and  are  included  in
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items in the consolidated balance sheets:

Investments in equity securities that are not accounted for under equity method accounting or result in consolidation are to be
measured  at  fair  value.  For  investments  in  equity  securities  without  readily  determinable  fair  values,  Verizon  elects  the
measurement  alternative  permitted  under  GAAP  to  measure  these  investments  at  cost,  less  any  impairment,  plus  or  minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
For investments in debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity
securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt
securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered.
The  gross  amount  of  accounts  receivable  and  corresponding  allowance  for  credit  losses  are  presented  separately  in  the
consolidated  balance  sheets.  We  maintain  allowances  for  credit  losses  resulting  from  the  expected  failure  or  inability  of  our
customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based
on  management’s  expectation  of  the  asset’s  collectability.  The  allowance  is  based  on  multiple  factors  including  historical
experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic
conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management’s expectations of conditions in the future, as applicable.
Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar
risk characteristics.

We pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and shared risk characteristics of
"new customers" and "existing customers." New customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for less than
210  days.  Existing  customers  are  defined  as  customers  who  have  been  with  Verizon  for  210  days  or  more.  We  record  an
allowance  to  reduce  the  receivables  to  the  amount  that  is  expected  to  be  collectible.  For  device  payment  plan  agreement
receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected
loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned
individually  on  a  customer  by  customer  basis  and  the  custom  credit  scores  are  then  aggregated  by  vintage  and  used  in  our
proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance.

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

62

We  monitor  the  collectability  of  our  wireless  service  receivables  as  one  overall  pool.  Wireline  service  receivables  are
disaggregated  and  pooled  by  the  following  customer  groups:  consumer,  small  and  medium  business,  global  enterprise,  public
sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the
allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account
from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss
amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector
and  wholesale  wireline  receivables,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  based  on  historical  write-off  experience  and  individual
customer credit risk, as applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above.

Inventories

Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally
on either an average cost or first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value.

Plant and Depreciation

We  record  property,  plant  and  equipment  at  cost.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  generally  depreciated  on  a  straight-line
basis.

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the
related lease, calculated from the time the asset was placed in service.

When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from
the  property,  plant  and  equipment  accounts  and  any  gains  or  losses  on  disposition  are  recognized  in  Selling,  general  and
administrative expense.

We  capitalize  and  depreciate  network  software  purchased  or  developed  within  property,  plant  and  equipment  assets.  We  also
capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a
reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related assets.

Computer Software and Cloud Computing Costs

We capitalize the cost of internal-use network and non-network software and defer the costs associated with cloud computing
arrangements that have a useful life and term in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-
use  network  and  non-network  software  are  capitalized  only  to  the  extent  that  they  add  significant  new  functionality.  Planning,
software maintenance and training costs for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements are expensed in the period
in  which  they  are  incurred.  We  capitalize  interest  associated  with  the  development  of  internal-use  network  and  non-network
software.  Capitalized  non-network  internal-use  software  costs  are  amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  a  period  of
7 years and are included in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred in implementing a
cloud  computing  arrangement  are  deferred  during  the  application-development  stage  and  recorded  as  Prepaid  expense  and
other  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Once  a  project  is  substantially  complete  and  ready  for  its  intended  use,  we  stop
deferring the related cloud computing arrangement costs.

For a discussion of our impairment policy for capitalized non-network software costs, see "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
below. See Note 4 for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
Similar  to  capitalized  software  costs,  deferred  costs  associated  with  cloud  computing  arrangements  are  subject  to  impairment
testing.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment
testing for goodwill is performed annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.

To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment. However, we may elect
to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment
exist. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.

Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from
the  last  quantitative  test  and  the  excess  of  fair  value  over  carrying  value  from  this  test,  macroeconomic  conditions  (including
changes  in  interest  rates  and  discount  rates),  industry  and  market  considerations  (including  industry  revenue  and  Earnings
before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization  (EBITDA)  margin  results,  projections  and  recent  merger  and  acquisition
activity), the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.

The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and compares the fair value of the reporting
unit  (calculated  using  a  combination  of  a  market  approach  and  a  discounted  cash  flow  method,  as  a  form  of  the  income

approach) to its carrying value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see "Fair
Value  Measurements"  discussion  below  for  additional  information.  The  market  approach  includes  the  use  of  comparative
multiples of guideline companies to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the
present  value  of  two  components,  projected  cash  flows  and  a  terminal  value.  The  terminal  value  represents  the  expected
normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the
reporting  unit  is  calculated  based  on  the  sum  of  the  present  value  of  the  cash  flows  from  the  discrete  period  and  the  present
value  of  the  terminal  value.  The  discount  rate  represents  our  estimate  of  the  weighted-average  cost  of  capital,  or  expected
return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value,
an  impairment  charge  is  booked  for  the  excess  carrying  value  over  fair  value,  limited  to  the  total  amount  of  goodwill  of  that
reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic planning review for each of our reporting
units. Those plans consider current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates
and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.

See Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.

Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization

A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to
utilize  designated  radio  frequency  spectrum  to  provide  wireless  communication  services.  While  licenses  are  issued  for  only  a
fixed  time,  generally  ten  to  fifteen  years,  such  licenses  are  subject  to  renewal  by  the  Federal  Communications  Commission
(FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no
legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result,
we  treat  the  wireless  licenses  as  an  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset.  We  re-evaluate  the  useful  life  determination  for  wireless
licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate
our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our
nationwide wireless network.

We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have
the  option  to  first  perform  a  qualitative  assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment
test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment  in  any  period  and  proceed  directly  to  performing  the
quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.

As  part  of  our  qualitative  assessment  we  consider  several  factors  including  the  business  enterprise  value  of  our  combined
wireless  business,  macroeconomic  conditions  (including  changes  in  interest  rates  and  discount  rates),  industry  and  market
considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity),
the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors including
the result of our last quantitative assessment. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.

Our quantitative impairment assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the
aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our wireless
licenses  using  the  Greenfield  approach.  The  Greenfield  approach  is  an  income  based  valuation  approach  that  values  the
wireless  licenses  by  calculating  the  cash  flow  generating  potential  of  a  hypothetical  start-up  company  that  goes  into  business
with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace
participant  would  be  willing  to  pay  to  purchase  the  aggregated  wireless  licenses  as  of  the  valuation  date.  If  the  estimated  fair
value  of  the  aggregated  wireless  licenses  is  less  than  the  aggregated  carrying  amount  of  the  wireless  licenses,  then  an
impairment charge is recognized.

Interest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized
as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and
the license is ready for its intended use.

Wireless  licenses  can  be  purchased  through  public  auctions  conducted  by  the  FCC.  Deposits  required  to  participate  in  these
auctions  and  purchase  licenses  are  recorded  within  Other  assets  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  until  the  corresponding
licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets

Our  intangible  assets  that  do  not  have  indefinite  lives  (primarily  customer  lists  and  non-network  internal-use  software)  are
amortized  over  their  estimated  useful  lives. All  of  our  intangible  assets  subject  to  amortization  and  other  long-lived  assets  are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of
the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted
cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset
and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine
whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.

the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.

Leases

We lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which
include  dark  fiber,  equipment,  and  other  various  types  of  assets  for  use  in  our  operations  under  both  operating  and  finance
leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For arrangements considered leases or
that contain a lease that is accounted for separately, we determine the classification and initial measurement of the right-of-use
asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the underlying asset becomes available for use.

For both operating and finance leases, we recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use the underlying asset
for the lease term, and a lease liability, which represents the present value of our obligation to make payments arising over the
lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance
leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company
would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Management
uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate, which is updated on a quarterly
basis.

In  those  circumstances  where  Verizon  is  the  lessee,  we  account  for  non-lease  components  associated  with  our  leases  (e.g.,
common area maintenance costs) and lease components as a single lease component for substantially all of our asset classes.
Additionally, in arrangements where we are the lessor, we have customer premise equipment for which we account for non-lease
components (e.g., service revenue) and lease components as combined components under the revenue recognition guidance in
Topic 606 as the service revenues are the predominant components in the arrangements.

Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included in either Cost
of  services  or  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  income,  based  on  the  use  of  the
facility  or  equipment  on  which  rent  is  being  paid.  Variable  rent  payments  related  to  both  operating  and  finance  leases  are
expensed  in  the  period  incurred.  Our  variable  lease  payments  consist  of  payments  dependent  on  various  external  indicators,
including real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges and utility usage.

Operating  leases  with  a  term  of  12  months  or  less  are  not  recorded  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets;  we  recognize  rent
expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We  recognize  the  amortization  of  the  right-of-use  asset  for  our  finance  leases  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  shorter  of  the
lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset in Depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of
income. The interest expense related to finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method based on the discount
rate determined at lease commencement and is included within Interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.

See Note 6 for additional information related to leases, including disclosure required under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be
received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market  participants.  The  three-tier
hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value
for assets and liabilities, is as follows:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3 — Unobservable pricing inputs in the market

Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair  value  measurements.  Our  assessment  of  the  significance  of  a  particular  input  to  the  fair  value  measurements  requires
judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value
hierarchy.

Income Taxes

Our  effective  tax  rate  is  based  on  pre-tax  income,  statutory  tax  rates,  tax  laws  and  regulations  and  tax  planning  strategies
available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.

Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets
and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and
liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount
that is more likely than not to be realized.

65

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first
step  is  recognition:  we  determine  whether  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  a  tax  position  will  be  sustained  upon  examination,
including  resolution  of  any  related  appeals  or  litigation  processes,  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.  In  evaluating
whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by
the  appropriate  taxing  authority  that  has  full  knowledge  of  all  relevant  information.  The  second  step  is  measurement:  a  tax
position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in
the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized  upon  ultimate  settlement.  Differences  between  tax  positions  taken  in  a  tax  return  and  amounts  recognized  in  the
financial  statements  will  generally  result  in  one  or  more  of  the  following:  an  increase  in  a  liability  for  income  taxes  payable,  a
reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability.

Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors
based on estimated fair values. See Note 10 for additional information.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The  functional  currency  of  our  foreign  operations  is  generally  the  local  currency.  For  these  foreign  entities,  we  translate  their
financial statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-
of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive
loss, a separate component of Equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from
the conversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of Other income (expense), net.

Employee Benefit Plans

Pension  and  postretirement  health  care  and  life  insurance  benefits  earned  during  the  year,  as  well  as  interest  on  projected
benefit obligations, are accrued. Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized
over  the  average  remaining  service  period  of  the  employees  expected  to  receive  benefits.  Expected  return  on  plan  assets  is
determined by applying the return on assets assumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognized in Other income (expense), net in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of
December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service
towards the Company retiree medical subsidy. See Note 11 for additional information.

We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’s funded status as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets.
Also, we measure any unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income tax.

Derivative Instruments

We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest  rates.  We  employ  risk  management  strategies,  which  may  include  the  use  of  a  variety  of  derivatives  including  cross
currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and
foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.

We measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our
derivative instruments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms
of  our  derivative  contracts  and  thus  are  classified  as  Level  2.  Changes  in  the  fair  values  of  derivative  instruments  applied  as
economic  hedges  are  recognized  in  earnings  in  the  current  period.  For  fair  value  hedges,  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the
derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Unrealized gains or
losses on excluded components of fair value hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized into
earnings on a systematic and rational basis through the swap accrual over the life of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the
change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative  instruments  is  reported  in  Other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  and  recognized  in
earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net investment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the
change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative
translation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment.

Cash  flows  from  derivatives,  which  are  designated  as  accounting  hedges  or  applied  as  economic  hedges,  are  presented
consistently with the cash flow classification of the related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional information.

Variable Interest Entities

VIEs  are  entities  that  lack  sufficient  equity  to  permit  the  entity  to  finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial
support from other parties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

66

operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the
residual returns of the entity. We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
The  primary  beneficiary  is  the  party  that  has  the  power  to  make  the  decisions  that  most  significantly  affect  the  economic
performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant
to the VIE.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

On  January  1,  2020,  we  adopted  ASU  2016-13,  Financial  Instruments  - Credit  Losses  (Topic  326)  using  the  modified
retrospective  approach.  The  cumulative  after-tax  effect  of  the  changes  made  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the
adoption of Topic 326 was as follows:

See Note 8 for additional information related to credit losses, including disclosures required under Topic 326.

Note 2. Revenue and Contract Costs
We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and
through the sale of wireless equipment.

Revenue by Category

We have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units, Consumer and Business. Revenue
is  disaggregated  by  products  and  services  within  Consumer,  and  customer  groups  (Small  and  Medium  Business,  Global
Enterprise,  Public  Sector  and  Other,  and  Wholesale)  within  Business.  See  Note  13  for  additional  information  on  revenue  by
segment.  Corporate  and  other  primarily  includes  insurance  captive  revenues  as  well  as  the  historical  results  of  divested
businesses, including Verizon Media.

We  also  earn  revenues  that  are  not  accounted  for  under Topic  606  from  leasing  arrangements  (such  as  those  for  towers  and
equipment),  captive  reinsurance  arrangements  primarily  related  to  wireless  device  insurance  and  the  interest  on  equipment
financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. As allowed by the practical
expedient  within  Topic  842,  we  have  elected  to  combine  the  lease  and  non-lease  components  for  those  arrangements  of
customer  premise  equipment  where  we  are  the  lessor  as  components  accounted  for  under  Topic  606.  Revenues  from
arrangements that were not accounted for under Topic 606 were approximately $3.2 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for the
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Remaining Performance Obligations

When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price
may  relate  to  service  performance  obligations  which  were  not  satisfied  or  are  partially  satisfied  as  of  the  end  of  the  reporting
period.  Below  we  disclose  information  relating  to  these  unsatisfied  performance  obligations.  We  apply  the  practical  expedient
available  under  Topic  606  that  provides  the  option  to  exclude  the  expected  revenues  arising  from  unsatisfied  performance
obligations  related  to  contracts  that  have  an  original  expected  duration  of  one  year  or  less. This  situation  primarily  arises  with
respect  to  certain  month-to-month  service  contracts.  At  December  31,  2022,  month-to-month  service  contracts  represented
approximately  94%  of  our  wireless  postpaid  contracts  and  92%  of  our  wireline  Consumer  and  Small  and  Medium  Business
contracts, compared to December 31, 2021, for which month-to-month service contracts represented approximately 93% of our
wireless postpaid contracts and 86% of our wireline Consumer and Small and Medium Business contracts.

Additionally, certain contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fees related to these additional
services are recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).

Contracts  for  wireless  services,  with  or  without  promotional  credits  that  require  maintenance  of  service,  are  generally  either
month-to-month and cancellable at any time, or considered to contain terms ranging from greater than one month to up to thirty-
six months (typically under a device payment plan), or contain terms ranging from greater than one month to up to twenty-four
months  (typically  under  a  fixed-term  plan).  Additionally,  customers  may  incur  charges  based  on  usage  or  additional  optional
services purchased in conjunction with entering into a contract that can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included
in the transaction price. The transaction price allocated to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially
satisfied as of the end of the reporting period, are generally related to contracts that are not accounted for as month-to-month
contracts.

Our Consumer group customers also include traditional wholesale resellers that purchase and resell wireless service under their
own  brands  to  their  respective  customers.  Reseller  arrangements  generally  include  a  stated  contract  term,  which  typically

67

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

extends longer than two years and, in some cases, include a periodic minimum revenue commitment over the contract term for
which revenues will be recognized in future periods.

Consumer customer contracts for wireline services are generally month-to-month; however, they may have a service term of two
years or shorter than twelve months. Certain contracts with Business customers for wireline services extend into future periods,
contain  fixed  monthly  fees  and  usage-based  fees,  and  can  include  annual  commitments  in  each  year  of  the  contract  or
commitments  over  the  entire  specified  contract  term;  however,  a  significant  number  of  contracts  for  wireline  services  with  our
Business customers have a contract term that is twelve months or less.

Additionally,  there  are  certain  contracts  with  Business  customers  for  wireline  and  telematics  services  that  have  a  contractual
minimum fee over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be recognized related to those
contracts; thus, they are excluded from the time bands below. These contracts have varying terms spanning over approximately
nine years ending in April 2032 and have aggregate contract minimum payments totaling $1.6 billion.

At December 31, 2022, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations that are expected to be recognized
for  2023,  2024  and  thereafter  was  $22.1  billion,  $14.3  billion  and  $8.1  billion,  respectively.  Remaining  performance  obligation
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations and changes in the timing and scope
of contracts, arising from contract modifications.

Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presented in our consolidated
balance  sheets  represent  an  unconditional  right  to  consideration.  Contract  balances  represent  amounts  from  an  arrangement
when  either  Verizon  has  performed,  by  transferring  goods  or  services  to  the  customer  in  advance  of  receiving  all  or  partial
consideration  for  such  goods  and  services  from  the  customer,  or  the  customer  has  made  payment  to  Verizon  in  advance  of
obtaining control of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract.

The following table presents information about receivables from contracts with customers:

Contract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for goods or services provided to customers but for which we do not
have an unconditional right at the reporting date. Under a fixed-term plan, total contract revenue is allocated between wireless
service  and  equipment  revenues.  In  conjunction  with  these  arrangements,  a  contract  asset  is  created,  which  represents  the
difference between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration received from the
customer when the performance obligation related to the transfer of control of the equipment is satisfied. The contract asset is
reclassified to accounts receivable as wireless services are provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as service
is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in
our consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We recognize the allowance for credit losses
at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's collectability.

Contract assets remained relatively flat during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Contract  liabilities  arise  when  we  bill  our  customers  and  receive  consideration  in  advance  of  providing  the  goods  or  services
promised in the contract. We typically bill service one month in advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability
balance.  Contract  liabilities  are  recognized  as  revenue  when  services  are  provided  to  the  customer.  The  contract  liability
balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities.

Contract  liabilities  increased  $1.0  billion  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022.  The  change  in  contract  liabilities  was
primarily due to increases in sales promotions recognized over time and upfront fees. Contract liabilities increased $1.6 billion
during the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in sales promotions

recognized over time and upfront fees, increases in deferred revenue related to advanced billings, as well as the acquisition of
TracFone, partially offset by the satisfaction of performance obligations related to wireless and Fios services, as well as the sale
of Verizon Media.

Revenue recognized during both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to contract liabilities existing at January
1, 2022 and 2021 were $5.0 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, as performance obligations related to services were satisfied.

As discussed in Note 1, Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which
are  then  amortized  to  expense  over  the  respective  periods  of  expected  benefit.  We  recognize  an  asset  for  incremental
commission expenses paid to internal and external sales personnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts.
We only defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are incremental costs that would not have been incurred
absent the customer contract and are expected to be recoverable. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably
as commission expense over the period representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Costs to obtain
wireless contracts are amortized over both of our Consumer and Business customers' estimated device upgrade cycles, as such
costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Costs to obtain wireline contracts are amortized as expense over the
estimated  customer  relationship  period  for  our  Consumer  customers.  Incremental  costs  to  obtain  wireline  contracts  for  our
Business customers are insignificant. Costs to obtain contracts are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.

We also defer costs incurred to fulfill contracts that: (1) relate directly to the contract; (2) are expected to generate resources that
will  be  used  to  satisfy  our  performance  obligation  under  the  contract;  and  (3)  are  expected  to  be  recovered  through  revenue
generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed as we satisfy our performance obligations and recorded in
Cost  of  services.  These  costs  principally  relate  to  direct  costs  that  enhance  our  wireline  business  resources,  such  as  costs
incurred to install circuits.

We determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the
similarities within these customer contract portfolios.

Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred.

Collectively, costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as deferred contract costs, and amortized over
a two-to six-year period. Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within Prepaid expenses and other and
Other assets, respectively.

The balances of deferred contract costs included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

For both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized expense of $3.0 billion associated with the amortization
of deferred contract costs, primarily within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

We assess our deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the
carrying  amount  of  a  deferred  cost  exceeds  the  remaining  amount  of  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  in  exchange  for  the
goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those goods and services that have

not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment charges recognized for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021.

Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Spectrum License Transactions

In March 2020, the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103, for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands
concluded. Verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4,940 licenses, which primarily consisted of
37 GHz and, to a lesser extent, 39 GHz spectrum. As an incumbent licensee, our 39 GHz licenses provided us with incentive
payments  that  were  applied  towards  the  purchase  price  of  spectrum  in  the  auction. The  value  of  the  licenses  won  by  Verizon
amounted  to  $3.4  billion,  of  which  $1.8  billion  was  settled  with  the  relinquished  39  GHz  licenses. The  remaining  balance  was
settled in cash of $1.6 billion. In connection with the incentive auction, a pre-tax net loss of $1.2 billion  ($914 million  after-tax)
was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income during 2020 because the
exchange of the previously held licenses for new licenses had commercial substance.

In  February  2021,  the  FCC  concluded Auction  107  for  C-Band  wireless  spectrum.  Verizon  paid $45.5  billion  for  the  licenses  it
won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is
required  to  make  additional  payments  to  acquire  the  licenses.  The  payments  are  for  our  allocable  share  of  clearing  costs
incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be
$7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion  primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs.
During 2022, we made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing
costs, of which $1.4 billion were accrued as of December 31, 2021 in our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to continue to
make  payments  related  to  clearing  cost  and  incentive  payment  obligations  through  2024,  which  we  expect  to  be $4.8  billion.
These  payments  are  dependent  on  the  incumbent  license  holders  accelerated  clearing  of  the  spectrum  for  Verizon’s  use  and,
therefore,  the  final  timing  and  amounts  could  differ  based  on  the  incumbent  holders’  execution  of  their  clearing  process.  In
accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum
won  in Auction  107  consists  of  all  payments  required  to  participate  and  purchase  licenses  in  the  auction,  including  Verizon’s
allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the
auction  that  we  are  obligated  to  pay  in  order  to  acquire  the  licenses,  as  well  as  capitalized  interest  to  the  extent  qualifying
activities have occurred.

In March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain
markets  and  frequencies  ahead  of  the  previously  expected  December  2023  timeframe.  During  2022,  Verizon  incurred  costs
associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which $310 million was paid as of December 31, 2022. This
early clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a number of key markets to support its fifth-generation (5G)
network initiatives.

During 2022 and 2021, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of an
insignificant  amount  and  $95  million,  respectively.  During  2021,  we  recognized  a  pre-tax  loss  in  connection  with  the  sale  of
certain wireless licenses of $223 million ($167 million after tax).

Business Acquisitions and Divestitures

TracFone Wireless, Inc.
In  September  2020,  we  entered  into  a  purchase  agreement  (TracFone  Purchase  Agreement)  with  América  Móvil  to  acquire
TracFone, a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021 (the
Acquisition  Date).  The  acquisition  positions  Verizon  as  the  leading  prepaid,  value  and  premium  wireless  carrier  by  expanding
Verizon’s portfolio, bringing enhanced access of our wireless network and comprehensive suite of mobility products and services
to a new customer base.

In  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  TracFone  Purchase  Agreement,  Verizon  acquired  all  of  TracFone's  outstanding  stock  in
exchange  for  approximately  $3.5  billion  in  cash,  net  of  cash  acquired  and  working  capital  and  other  adjustments,  57,596,544
shares of our common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash contingent
consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of
the common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of
the contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $560 million and represents a Level 3 measurement
as  defined  in  ASC  820,  Fair  Value  Measurements  and  Disclosures.  See  Note  9  for  additional  information.  The  contingent
consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn
out period, as defined in the TracFone Purchase Agreement.

In May 2022, Verizon received net cash proceeds of $248 million for the final settlement of working capital, which was included in
our  consideration  as  of  the Acquisition  Date.  During  2022,  Verizon  made  payments  of  $188  million  related  to  the  contingent
consideration, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended  December  31,  2022.  In  January  2023,  we  made  an  additional  payment  of  $102  million  related  to  the  contingent
consideration. Contingent consideration payments are expected to continue through 2024.

During  2022,  we  recorded  a  measurement  period  adjustment  resulting  in  changes  to  the  fair  value  and  amortization  period  of
certain intangible assets. As such, we recorded an adjustment to the fair value of certain intangible assets with a corresponding
adjustment to goodwill. As a result of the changes in the provisional fair value and amortization period of certain intangible assets
during the one-year measurement period, amortization expense decreased $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Other intangible assets include $2.4 billion related to customer relationships, with a weighted-average amortization period of 7
years, $1.1 billion related to distribution relationships, with an amortization period of 5 years, $740 million related to trade names
with a weighted-average amortization period of 17 years and $145 million related to acquired technology, with an amortization
period of 10 years. The intangible assets were assigned fair values using an income approach. The valuations are considered
Level  3  fair  value  measurements  due  to  the  use  of  significant  inputs  not  observable  in  the  market,  which  include  the  discount
rate, royalty rate and amount and timing of future cash flows.

Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration paid and payable and the fair
value of the net assets acquired, representing future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition.
The goodwill related to this acquisition is included within the Consumer segment.

Pursuant  to the TracFone Purchase Agreement, América Móvil agreed to indemnify Verizon against certain pre-acquisition  tax
matters  and  other  contingencies.  We  have  recorded  total  contingent  liabilities  and  offsetting  indemnification  assets  of
$672  million  for  the  expected  reimbursement  of  these  matters  that  had  not  been  resolved  as  of  the  Acquisition  Date.  The
liabilities are presented in Other liabilities and the indemnification assets are presented in Other assets, within our consolidated
balance  sheets.  The  amounts  recognized  represent  reasonable  estimates  based  on  an  evaluation  of  current  facts  and
circumstances. Actual  outcome  may  differ  significantly  from  these  estimates.  We  expect  that  any  additional  liabilities  that  may
arise related to these indemnified matters would be indemnified and reimbursed by América Móvil.

Bluegrass Cellular

In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Bluegrass Cellular, a rural wireless operator
serving central Kentucky. The transaction closed in March 2021. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing
of the transaction was approximately $412 million, net of cash acquired.

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Verizon Media Divestiture

On  May  2,  2021,  Verizon  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  with  an  affiliate  of  Apollo  Global  Management  Inc.  (the  Apollo
Affiliate)  pursuant  to  which  we  agreed  to  sell  Verizon  Media  in  return  for  consideration  of  $4.3  billion  in  cash,  subject  to
customary adjustments, $750 million in non-convertible preferred limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate and 10% of the
fully-diluted common limited partnership units of the Apollo Affiliate.

On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. As of the close of the transaction, cash proceeds, the fair value
of  the  non-convertible  preferred  limited  partnership  units  of  the  Apollo  Affiliate  and  the  fair  value  of  10%  of  the  fully-diluted
common  limited  partnership  units  of  the  Apollo  Affiliate  were  $4.3  billion,  $496  million,  and  $124  million,  respectively.  We
recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $1.0 billion (after-tax $1.0 billion) in Selling general and administrative expense
in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we incurred $346 million of various
costs  associated  with  this  disposition  which  are  primarily  recorded  in  Selling  general  and  administrative  expense  in  our
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.

During  2022  and  2021,  the Apollo Affiliate  redeemed  $37  million  and  $100  million,  respectively,  of  Verizon’s  preferred  limited
partnership  interest  reducing  the  carrying  value  of  our  preferred  interest  as  of  December  31,  2022  to  $359  million.  The
redemptions are reflected within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years
ended  December  31,  2022  and  December  31,  2021,  respectively.  Verizon’s  10%  common  interest  in  the  Apollo  Affiliate  is
accounted  for  as  an  equity  method  investment.  The  post-sale  results  of  Verizon’s  common  ownership  interest  in  the  Apollo
Affiliate are recorded through the equity method of accounting, within Corporate and other.

In connection with the closing of the transaction, we entered into Transition Services Agreements with the Apollo Affiliate, under
which Verizon will continue to provide and receive specified technical services to support operations for up to 18 months.

Under  our  ownership,  Verizon  Media  generated  revenues  from  contracts  with  customers  under  Topic  606  of  approximately
$5.3 billion and $7.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflected within our Corporate and
Other segment.

Other

During  2022  and  2021,  we  completed  various  other  acquisitions  for  cash  consideration  of  an  insignificant  amount  and
approximately $51 million, respectively.

In connection with a non-strategic divestiture and other activity we recorded a pre-tax net gain of an insignificant amount in our
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In December 2021, we completed the sale of an investment. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of
$131  million  in  Equity  in  earnings  (losses)  of  unconsolidated  businesses  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  for  the  year
ended December 31, 2021.

2022
149,796  $

$

At  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  approximately  $41.7  billion  and  $54.9  billion,  respectively,  of  wireless  licenses  were  under
development for commercial service for which we were capitalizing interest costs. We recorded approximately $1.7 billion and
$1.6 billion of capitalized interest on wireless licenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

During  2022  and  2021,  we  renewed  various  wireless  licenses  in  accordance  with  FCC  regulations  with  an  average  renewal
period of 15 years and 11 years, respectively. See Note 1 for additional information.

As  discussed  in  Note  1,  we  test  our  wireless  licenses  for  potential  impairment  annually  or  more  frequently  if  impairment
indicators are present. In 2022, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment, which indicated it was more likely than not
that the fair value of our wireless licenses remained above their carrying amount and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.
In  2021,  we  performed  a  quantitative  impairment  test,  which  compared  the  estimated  fair  value  of  our  aggregate  wireless
licenses, estimated using the Greenfield approach, to the aggregated carrying amount of the licenses as of the test date. Our
annual assessment in 2021 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, did
not result in an impairment.

Our  strategy  requires  significant  capital  investments  primarily  to  acquire  wireless  spectrum,  put  the  spectrum  into  service,
provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our
networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities.

(1) Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment charges of $4.8 billion, related to our historical Media reporting unit, which included

$

Verizon Media. On September 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Verizon Media. See Note 3 for additional information.

(2) Changes in goodwill due to acquisitions is related to TracFone, Bluegrass and other insignificant transactions. See Note 3 for

additional information.

(3) Changes in goodwill due to acquisitions is related to TracFone. See Note 3 for additional information.
(4) Includes a goodwill impairment charge of $16 million related to an early stage development company presented within Other,
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December
31, 2022.

We  performed  a  qualitative  impairment  assessment  for  our  Consumer  reporting  unit  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022.  Our
qualitative impairment assessment indicated that it  was  more likely than not that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit
exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.

We  performed  a  quantitative  impairment  assessment  for  our  Business  reporting  unit  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022.  We
applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach, reflecting
current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which indicated that
the fair value of our Business reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. We do not
anticipate  reasonable  changes  in  significant  estimates  to  change  the  outcome  of  the  quantitative  impairment  assessment.
However,  as  a  result  of  our  2022  goodwill  assessment,  management  believes  there  is  an  increasing  risk  that  our  Business
reporting unit may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the future.

A projected sustained decline in the reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair
value  and  may  result  in  impairment  charges.  Such  a  decline  could  be  driven  by,  among  other  things:  (1)  decreases  in  sales
volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in
achieving  the  goals  in  strategic  initiatives.  Also,  adverse  changes  to  macroeconomic  factors,  such  as  increases  in  long-term
interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit.

We performed quantitative impairment assessments for both our Consumer and Business reporting units in 2021. We applied a
combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method, as a form of the income approach, which indicated that
the fair values for our Consumer and Business reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, did not result in an
impairment.

We enter into various lease arrangements for network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real
estate and connectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our
leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend
the leases term for up to 25 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered
into during the current period, we have concluded it is not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the
lease or not terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease commencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these
options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American
Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                74

$5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates
in  2015,  with  options  to  renew.  We  continue  to  include  the  towers  in  Property,  plant  and  equipment,  net  in  our  consolidated
balance  sheets  and  depreciate  them  accordingly.  In  addition  to  the  rights  to  lease  and  operate  the  towers,  American  Tower
assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases related to these towers. While American Tower can renegotiate the terms of
and  is  responsible  for  paying  the  ground  leases,  we  are  still  the  primary  obligor  for  these  leases  and  accordingly,  the  present
value of these ground leases are included in our operating  lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. We do not
expect to be required to make ground lease payments unless American Tower defaults, which we determined to be remote.

As of December 31, 2022, we have contractually obligated lease payments amounting to $2.0 billion primarily for office facility
operating leases and small cell colocation and fiber operating leases that have not yet commenced. We have legally obligated
lease payments for various other operating leases that have not yet commenced for which the total obligation was not significant.
We  have  certain  rights  and  obligations  for  these  leases,  but  have  not  recognized  an  operating  lease  right-of-use  asset  or  an
operating lease liability since they have not yet commenced.

(1) The debt obligations bore interest at a floating rate based on the Compounded Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for
the interest period or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable interest margin per annum, as applicable.
Compounded SOFR is calculated using the SOFR Index published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in accordance
with the formula set forth in the terms of the notes. The Compounded SOFR for the interest period ending in December 2022
was 3.450%. The one-month and three-month LIBOR at December 31, 2022 was 4.392% and 4.767%, respectively.

During  2022,  we  received  $17.8  billion  of  proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings,  which  included  $10.7  billion  of  proceeds  from
asset-backed debt transactions. The net proceeds were primarily used for general corporate purposes including the repayment
of debt and the funding of certain renewable energy projects. We used $13.6 billion of cash to repay, redeem and repurchase
long-term  borrowings  and  finance  lease  obligations,  including  $4.9  billion  to  prepay  and  repay  asset-backed,  long-term
borrowings. The net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion from the green bond issued in 2022 are expected to be used to fund
certain renewable energy projects.

During  2021,  we  received  $41.4  billion  of  proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings,  which  included  $8.4  billion  of  proceeds  from
asset-backed  debt  transactions.  The  net  proceeds  were  primarily  used  to  finance  the  purchase  of  wireless  licenses  won  in
connection with the FCC's auction for C-Band wireless spectrum, Auction 107, and fund certain renewable energy projects. We

used  $18.9  billion  of  cash  to  repay,  redeem  and  repurchase  long-term  borrowings  and  finance  lease  obligations,  including
$4.8  billion  to  prepay  and  repay  asset-backed,  long-term  borrowings. The  net  proceeds  of  approximately $1.0  billion  from  the
green bond issued in 2021 were used to fund certain renewable energy projects.

Short-term Borrowing and Commercial Paper Program

In March 2022, we entered into and fully drew from a $1.0 billion short-term uncommitted credit facility. In December 2022, we
fully  repaid  $1.0  billion  under  the  short-term  uncommitted  credit  facility.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  we  had  no  short-term
borrowing outstanding.

In 2022, we issued $27.4 billion in commercial paper and we repaid $27.3 billion of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2022,
we  had  $150  million  of  commercial  paper  outstanding.  These  transactions  are  reflected  within  Cash  flows  from  financing
activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Asset-Backed Debt

As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $20.0 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes Asset-
Backed Notes (ABS Notes) issued to third-party investors (Investors) and loans (ABS Financing Facilities) received from banks
and their conduit facilities (collectively, the Banks). Our consolidated asset-backed debt bankruptcy remote legal entities (each,
an  ABS  Entity  or  collectively,  the  ABS  Entities)  issue  the  debt  or  are  otherwise  party  to  the  transaction  documentation  in

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                78

connection  with  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions.  Under  the  terms  of  our  asset-backed  debt,  Cellco  Partnership  (Cellco),  a
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  and  certain  other  Company  affiliates  (collectively,  the  Originators)  transfer  device
payment plan agreement receivables and certain other receivables (collectively referred to as certain receivables) to one of the
ABS  Entities,  which  in  turn  transfers  such  receivables  to  another ABS  Entity  that  issues  the  debt.  Verizon  entities  retain  the
equity interests and residual interests, as applicable, in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to
make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other related payments and expenses.

Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred receivables and future collections on such receivables. These receivables
transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of
asset-backed  debt  and  expenses  related  thereto,  payments  to  the  Originators  in  respect  of  additional  transfers  of  certain
receivables,  and  other  obligations  arising  from  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions,  and  will  not  be  available  to  pay  other
obligations  or  claims  of  Verizon’s  creditors  until  the  associated  asset-backed  debt  and  other  obligations  are  satisfied.  The
Investors or Banks, as applicable, which hold our asset-backed debt have legal recourse to the assets securing the debt, but do
not  have  any  recourse  to  Verizon  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  debt.  Under  a  parent  support
agreement, the Company has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and the Originators to the ABS
Entities.

Cash collections on the receivables collateralizing our asset-backed debt securities are required at certain specified times to be
placed  into  segregated  accounts.  Deposits  to  the  segregated  accounts  are  considered  restricted  cash  and  are  included  in
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

Proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions  are  reflected  in  Cash  flows  from  financing  activities  in  our  consolidated
statements of cash flows. The asset-backed debt issued is included in Debt maturing within one year and Long-term debt in our
consolidated balance sheets.

Under  the  terms  of  each  series  of ABS  Notes,  there  is  a  revolving  period  of  18  months,  two  years  or  up  to  three  years,  as
applicable, during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we
made aggregate principal repayments of $4.3 billion on ABS Notes that have entered the amortization period, including principal
payments  made  in  connection  with  clean-up  redemptions.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  made  aggregate
principal repayments of $3.3 billion on ABS Notes that had entered the amortization period, including principal payments made in
connection with clean-up redemptions.

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                80

In January 2023, we issued $932 million aggregate principal amount of ABS Notes, with a blended interest rate of approximately
4.511%, through an ABS Entity.

ABS Financing Facilities

Under  the  two  loan  agreements  in  connection  with  the  ABS  Financing  Facility  entered  into  in  December  2021  (2021  ABS
Financing Facility), we prepaid an aggregate of $515 million in January 2022, borrowed an additional $1.9 billion in March 2022,
prepaid an aggregate of $130 million in May 2022 and borrowed an additional $545 million in June 2022. In December 2022, we
renewed the loan agreements in connection with the 2021 ABS Financing Facility which reset the revolving period of one or two
years,  as  applicable,  and  we  borrowed  an  additional  $1.9  billion.  The  aggregate  outstanding  balance  under  the  2021  ABS
Financing Facility was $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2022.

In October 2022, we entered into an ABS financing facility with a financial institution (2022 ABS Financing Facility). Under the
terms of the 2022 ABS Financing Facility, the financial institution makes advances under asset-backed loans backed by certain
wireless service accounts receivables of both Consumer customers and Business customers. The loan agreement entered into
in connection with the 2022 ABS Financing Facility is outstanding with a final maturity date in June 2024 and the loan agreement
bears  interest  at  a  floating  rate.  There  is  an  18  month  revolving  period,  as  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement,  which  may  be
extended with the approval of the financial institution. Under the loan agreement, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of
the advances at any time without penalty, but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we may also
remove receivables from the applicable ABS Entity. In October 2022, we borrowed $2.0 billion under the loan agreement entered
into  in  connection  with  the  2022  ABS  Financing  Facility.  The  aggregate  outstanding  balance  under  the  2022  ABS  Financing
Facility was $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2022.

Variable Interest Entities

The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have both
the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s performance and the obligation to absorb
losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  of  the  entity.  Therefore,  the  assets,  liabilities  and  activities  of  the  ABS  Entities  are
consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheets.

The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included in our consolidated balance sheets were as

(1) The revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it
permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the
issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no drawings against the $9.5 billion revolving credit
facility since its inception.

(2) During 2022 and 2021, we drew down $3.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, from these facilities. Borrowings under certain
of  these  facilities  are  amortized  semi-annually  in  equal  installments  up  to  the  applicable  maturity  dates.  Maturities  reflect
maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot
be reborrowed.

In  January  2023,  we  submitted  an  irrevocable  request  to  borrow  approximately  $515  million  from  funds  available  under  our
export credit facilities in March 2023.

Non-Cash Transactions

During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we financed, primarily through alternative financing arrangements,
the purchase of approximately $832 million, $461 million, and $1.7 billion, respectively, of long-lived assets consisting primarily of
network  equipment. As  of  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  $1.7  billion  and  $1.3  billion,  respectively,  relating  to  these  financing
arrangements,  including  those  entered  into  in  prior  years  and  liabilities  assumed  through  acquisitions,  remained  outstanding.
These purchases are non-cash financing activities and therefore are not reflected within Capital expenditures in our consolidated
statements of cash flows.

Net Debt Extinguishment Losses

During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022,  2021  and  2020,  we  recorded  net  debt  extinguishment  losses  of  $1.1  billion,
$3.6  billion  and  $121  million,  respectively.  The  net  losses  are  recorded  in  Other  income  (expense),  net  in  our  consolidated
statements of income. The total losses are reflected within Other, net cash flow from operating activities and the portion of the
losses  representing  cash  payments  are  reflected  within  Other,  net  cash  flow  from  financing  activities  in  our  consolidated
statements of cash flows.

Guarantees

We  guarantee  the  debentures  of  our  operating  telephone  company  subsidiaries.  As  of  December  31,  2022,  $614  million
aggregate  principal  amount  of  these  obligations  remained  outstanding.  Each  guarantee  will  remain  in  place  for  the  life  of  the
obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms, including the operating telephone company no longer being a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company.

Debt Covenants

We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.

Included  in  Other  assets  and  Accounts  receivable,  net  at  December  31,  2022  are  net  device  payment  plan  agreement
receivables and net wireless service receivables of $23.6 billion, which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                82

reported in our consolidated balance sheet. Included in Other assets and Accounts receivable, net at December 31, 2021, are
net device payment plan agreement receivables of $16.0 billion, which have been transferred to ABS Entities and continue to be
reported  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  See  Note  7  for  additional  information.  We  believe  the  carrying  value  of  these
receivables approximate their fair value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model.

Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment
plan  agreement.  Customers  that  activate  service  on  devices  purchased  under  the  device  payment  program  pay  lower  service
fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge is included on their wireless
monthly bill. We no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue
to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers.  We also continue to service existing plans for customers who have not yet
purchased and activated devices under the Verizon device payment program.

For indirect channel wireless contracts with customers, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement
receivables. We record the imputed interest as a reduction to the related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included
within  Service  revenues  and  other  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  income,  is  recognized  over  the  financed  device  payment
term.

Promotions

In connection with certain device payment plan agreements, we may offer a promotion to allow our customers to upgrade to a
new  device  after  paying  down  a  certain  specified  portion  of  the  required  device  payment  plan  agreement  amount  as  well  as
trading in their device in good working order. When a customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to
upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. We recognize a liability measured at fair
value for the customer’s right to trade in the device which is determined by considering several factors, including the weighted-
average selling prices obtained in recent resales of similar devices eligible for trade-in. At December 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, the amount of the guarantee liability was $54 million and $77 million, respectively.

We may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new
device. Under these types of promotions, the customer receives a credit for the value of the trade-in device. At December 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021, the amount of trade-in liability was $562 million and $366 million, respectively.

In addition, we may provide the customer with additional future billing credits that will be applied against the customer’s monthly
bill as long as service is maintained. These future billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and
are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting in a contract liability.

Device payment plan agreement receivables, net, does not reflect the trade-in liability, additional future credits or the guarantee
liability.

Origination of Device Payment Plan Agreements

When  originating  device  payment  plan  agreements,  we  use  internal  and  external  data  sources  to  create  a  credit  risk  score  to
measure the credit quality of a customer and to determine eligibility for the device payment program. Verizon’s experience has
been that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future
payments. Customers with longer tenures tend to exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and
receivables  due  from  customers  with  longer  tenures  tend  to  perform  better  than  receivables  from  customers  that  have  not
previously  been  Verizon  customers. As  a  result  of  this  experience,  we  make  initial  lending  decisions  based  upon  whether  the
customers are "established customers" or "short-tenured customers." If a Consumer customer has been a customer for 45 days

   83

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

or  more,  or  if  a  Business  customer  has  been  a  customer  for  12  months  or  more,  the  customer  is  considered  an  "established
customer."  For  established  customers,  the  credit  decision  and  ongoing  credit  monitoring  processes  rely  on  a  combination  of
internal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has
been a customer for less than 12 months, the customer is considered a "short-tenured customer." For short-tenured customers,
the credit decision and credit monitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources.

Available external credit data from credit reporting agencies along with internal data are used to create custom credit risk scores
for  Consumer  customers.  The  custom  credit  risk  score  is  generated  automatically  from  the  applicant’s  credit  data  using
proprietary custom credit models. The credit risk score measures the likelihood that the potential customer will become severely
delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of short-tenured customer applications, a traditional credit
report is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient
credit history. In those instances, alternative credit data is used for the risk assessment. For Business customers, we also verify
the existence of the business with external data sources.

Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit. This
includes  an  account  level  spending  limit  and  a  maximum  amount  of  credit  allowed  per  device  for  Consumer  customers  or  a
required down payment percentage for Business customers.

Credit Quality Information

Subsequent to origination, we assess indicators for the quality of our wireless device payment plan agreement portfolio using two
models, one for new customers and one for existing customers. The model for new customers pools all Consumer and Business
wireless customers based on less than 210 days as "new customers." The model for existing customers pools all Consumer and
Business wireless customers based on 210 days or more as "existing customers."

The following table presents device payment plan agreement receivables, at amortized cost, as of December 31, 2022, by credit
quality indicator and year of origination:

The data presented in the table above was last updated on December 31, 2022.

We assess indicators for the quality of our wireless service receivables portfolio as one overall pool. As of December 31, 2022,
wireless service receivables, at amortized cost, originating in 2022 and 2021 were $5.1 billion and $58 million, respectively.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The credit quality indicators are used in determining the estimated amount and the timing of expected credit losses for the device
payment plan agreement and wireless service receivables portfolios.

For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our
proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as
noted  above.  The  loss  rate  is  assigned  individually  on  a  customer  by  customer  basis  and  the  custom  credit  scores  are  then
aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining
the allowance balance.

We  monitor  the  collectability  of  our  wireless  service  receivables  as  one  overall  pool.  Wireline  service  receivables  are
disaggregated  and  pooled  by  the  following  customer  groups:  consumer,  small  and  medium  business,  global  enterprise,  public
sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the
allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account
from  billing  to  write-off.  The  risk  of  loss  is  assessed  over  the  contractual  life  of  the  receivables  and  is  adjusted  based  on  the
historical  loss  amounts  for  current  and  future  conditions  based  on  management’s  qualitative  considerations.  For  global
enterprise,  public  sector  and  wholesale  wireline  receivables,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  based  on  historical  write-off
experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable.

We  monitor  delinquency  and  write-off  experience  based  on  the  quality  of  our  device  payment  plan  agreement  and  wireless
service receivables portfolios. The extent of our collection efforts with respect to a particular customer are based on the results of
our  proprietary  custom  internal  scoring  models  that  analyze  the  customer’s  past  performance  to  predict  the  likelihood  of  the
customer  falling  further  delinquent.  These  custom  scoring  models  assess  a  number  of  variables,  including  origination
characteristics,  customer  account  history  and  payment  patterns.  Since  our  customers’  behaviors  may  be  impacted  by  general
economic  conditions, we analyzed whether changes  in  macroeconomic conditions impact our credit loss experience and  have
concluded that our credit loss estimates are generally not materially impacted by reasonable and supportable forecasts of future
economic conditions. Based on the score derived from these models, accounts are grouped by risk category to determine the
collection  strategy  to  be  applied  to  such  accounts.  For  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables  and  wireless  service
receivables, we consider an account to be delinquent and in default status if there are unpaid charges remaining on the account
on the day after the bill’s due date. The risk class determines the speed and severity of the collections effort including initiatives
taken to facilitate customer payment.

Certain  of  our  equity  investments  do  not  have  readily  determinable  fair  values  and  are  excluded  from  the  tables  above.  Such
investments  are  measured  at  cost,  less  any  impairment,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in
orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer and are included in Investments in unconsolidated
businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of our
investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  was $804  million  and  $808  million,  respectively.  During  2022,  there  were
insignificant adjustments due to observable price changes and insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to
observable price changes and impairment charges were approximately $176 million and $82 million, respectively.

Verizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of TracFone, completed in November 2021. The fair
value  is  calculated  using  a  probability-weighted  discounted  cash  flow  model  and  represents  a  Level  3  measurement.  Level  3
instruments  include  valuation  based  on  unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions,  consistent  with  reasonably
available  assumptions  made  by  other  market  participants.  Subsequent  to  the  Acquisition  Date,  at  each  reporting  date,  the
contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair value. During 2022, we recorded gains of $57 million related to fair value
adjustments for the contingent consideration within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of
income. During 2022, we made payments of $188 million related to the contingent consideration. In January 2023, we made an
additional payment of $102 million related to the contingent consideration. See Note 3 for additional information.

Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the fixed income securities is based
on the quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or identical assets in inactive markets or models that apply inputs from
observable market data. The valuation determines that these securities are classified as Level 2.

Derivative  contracts  are  valued  using  models  based  on  readily  observable  market  parameters  for  all  substantial  terms  of  our
derivative  contracts  and  thus  are  classified  within  Level  2.  We  use  mid-market  pricing  for  fair  value  measurements  of  our
derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis.

We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period.

We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including interest
rate  swaps,  cross  currency  swaps,  forward  starting  interest  rate  swaps,  treasury  rate  locks,  interest  rate  caps,  swaptions  and
foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Swaps

We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and
pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges
and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value in our
consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded to Interest
expense, which are primarily offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.

Cross Currency Swaps

We have entered into cross currency swaps previously designated as cash flow hedges through March 31, 2022 to exchange our
British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to
fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A portion
of  the  loss  recognized  in Other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  was  reclassified  to  Interest  expense  to  offset  the  related  pre-tax
foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged item.

On March 31, 2022, we elected to de-designate our cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges and re-designated these swaps
as fair value hedges. For these hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the cross currency swaps related
to both time value and cross currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (the excluded components). The
initial value of the excluded components of $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 will continue to be amortized into Interest expense
over the remaining life of the hedging instruments. We estimate that $109 million will be amortized into Interest expense within
the next 12 months.

In addition to the previously mentioned cross currency swaps, we have executed additional cross currency swaps to exchange
Euro-denominated  cash  flows  into  U.S.  dollars  to  fix  our  cash  payments  in  U.S.  dollars.  These  swaps  are  designated  as  fair
value  hedges.  We  record  the  cross  currency  swaps  at  fair  value  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  as  assets  and  liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of the cross currency swaps attributable to changes in the spot rate of the hedged item and changes in
the recorded value of the hedged debt due to changes in spot rates are recorded in the same income statement line item. We
present  exchange  gains  and  losses  from  the  conversion  of  foreign  currency  denominated  debt  as  a  part  of  Interest  expense.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, these amounts completely offset each other and no net gain or loss was recorded.

Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  cross  currency  swaps  attributable  to  time  value  and  cross  currency  basis  spread  are  initially
recorded  to  Other  comprehensive  income  (loss).  Unrealized  gains  or  losses  on  excluded  components  are  recorded  in  Other
comprehensive  income  (loss)  and  are  recognized  into  Interest  expense  on  a  systematic  and  rational  basis  through  the  swap
accrual over the life of the hedging instrument. The amount remaining in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash
flow hedges on the date of transition will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings or when it
becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the amortization of
the  initial  value  of  the  excluded  component  completely  offset  the  amortization  related  to  the  amount  remaining  in  Other
comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedges. See Note 14 for additional information.

Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps

We have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to
interest rate changes on future forecasted transactions. We hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows based on
the  expected  maturities  of  the  related  forecasted  debt  issuance.  We  recognize  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  interest  rate
movements in Other comprehensive income (loss).

   89

            Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Treasury Rate Locks

We have entered into treasury rate locks designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate our interest rate risk on future transactions.
We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in Other comprehensive income (loss).

Net Investment Hedges

We have designated certain foreign currency debt instruments as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure
related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. The notional
amount of Euro-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge was €750 million as of both December 31, 2022 and
2021.

hedge accounting.

Swaptions

We enter into swaptions to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term
and  long-term  investments,  trade  receivables,  including  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables,  certain  notes  receivable,
including lease receivables, and derivative contracts.

Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements
(ISDA  master  agreements)  and  credit  support  annex  (CSA)  agreements  which  provide  rules  for  collateral  exchange. The  CSA
agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based
upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair
value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or
the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value. At December 31, 2022, we did
not hold any collateral. At December 31, 2022, we posted $2.3 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral
exchange agreements, which was recorded as Prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheet. At December 31,
2021, we held and posted $0.1 billion and an insignificant amount, respectively, of collateral related to derivative contracts under
collateral  exchange  arrangements,  which  were  recorded  as  Other  current  liabilities  and  Prepaid  expenses  and  other,
respectively,  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet. While  we  may  be  exposed  to  credit  losses  due  to  the  nonperformance  of  our
counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect
on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.

Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation

Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan

In  May  2017,  our  shareholders  approved  the  2017  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  (the  2017  Plan)  and  terminated  the  Company's
authority  to  grant  new  awards  under  the  Verizon  2009  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  (the  2009  Plan). The  2017  Plan  provides  for
broad-based  equity  grants  to  employees,  including  executive  officers,  and  permits  the  granting  of  stock  options,  stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                90

approval  of  the  2017  Plan,  we  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  2017  Plan  the  number  of  shares  that  were  remaining  but  not
issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise
terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares are reserved for
future issuance under the 2017 Plan.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the
grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant
date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled
in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs
granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent
the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In
2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan
to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements.

We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates.  We  use  historical  data  to  estimate  forfeitures  and  recognize  that  estimated  compensation  cost  of  restricted  stock
units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Performance Stock Units

The 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after
the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of
PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-
year performance cycle. The PSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using
the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The PSUs that
are settled in cash and are classified as liability awards are measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and,
therefore,  will  fluctuate  based  on  the  price  of  Verizon  common  stock  as  well  as  performance  relative  to  the  targets. All  PSUs
granted under the 2017 Plan have DEUs, which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU award
vests, and is paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled
activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved.

As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’s RSUs and PSUs
was approximately $604 million and is expected to be recognized over approximately 2 years.

The equity awards granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $53.26, $55.39 and $57.38
per unit, respectively. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid $433 million, $986 million and $961 million, respectively, to settle
RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

After-tax  compensation  expense  for  stock-based  compensation  related  to  RSUs  and  PSUs  described  above  included  in  Net
income attributable to Verizon was $609 million, $625 million and $780 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Note 11. Employee Benefits

We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. In addition, we maintain postretirement health
care  and  life  insurance  plans  for  certain  retirees  and  their  dependents,  which  are  both  contributory  and  non-contributory,  and
include  a  limit  on  our  share  of  the  cost  for  certain  current  and  future  retirees.  In  accordance  with  our  accounting  policy  for
pension  and  other  postretirement  benefits,  operating  expenses  include  service  costs  associated  with  pension  and  other
postretirement benefits while other credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates, an
estimated  return  on  plan  assets,  and  impact  from  health  care  trend  rates  are  reported  in Other  income  (expense),  net. These
estimates are updated in the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event, to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated
actuarial assumptions. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement
event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Modifications in
benefits have been bargained from time to time, and we may also periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The
following  tables  summarize  benefit  costs,  as  well  as  the  benefit  obligations,  plan  assets,  funded  status  and  rate  assumptions
associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $15.3 billion and $20.1 billion at December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively.

Actuarial Gain, Net

The net actuarial gain in 2022 is primarily the result of a $7.0 billion gain ($4.1 billion gain in the pension plan and $2.9 billion
gain in our postretirement benefit plans) due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year
liabilities  of  our  pension  plans  and  postretirement  benefit  plans  from  a  weighted-average  of 2.9%  at  December  31,  2021  to  a
weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022.

The net actuarial gain in 2021 is primarily the result of a $1.1 billion gain due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used
to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.6% at
December 31, 2020 to a weighted-average of 2.9% at December 31, 2021.

Plan Amendments

In July 2022, union members ratified the extension of our collective bargaining agreements with the Communications Workers of
America  and  the  International  Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers  for  three  years,  from  August  5,  2023  until  August  1,  2026.
Amendments  triggered  by  the  collective  bargaining  negotiations  were  made  to  certain  pension  plans  for  certain  union-
represented  employees.  The  impact  of  the  plan  amendments  was  an  increase  in  our  defined  benefit  pension  plans  plan
obligations  of  approximately  $427  million,  which  has  been  recorded  as  a  net  decrease  to Accumulated  other  comprehensive
income  (loss)  of  $317  million  (net  of  taxes  of  $110  million).  The  annual  impact  of  the  amount  recorded  in Accumulated  other
comprehensive income (loss) that will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost is minimal.

The  reclassifications  from  the  amounts  recorded  in Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  as  a  result  of  collective
bargaining agreements and plan amendments made in 2016, 2017 and 2018 resulted in a net decrease to net periodic benefit
cost and net increase to pre-tax income of approximately $390 million during 2022 and $708 million during 2021 and 2020.

In determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 5.2% in
2022.  The  rates  were  selected  to  approximate  the  composite  interest  rates  available  on  a  selection  of  high-quality  bonds
available  in  the  market  at  December  31,  2022. The  bonds  selected  had  maturities  that  coincided  with  the  time  periods  during
which benefits payments are expected to occur, were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at
least $300 million par outstanding).

In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each
major  asset  class  over  the  subsequent  10-year  period.  Those  estimates  are  based  on  a  combination  of  factors  including  the
current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To
determine  the  aggregate  return  for  the  pension  trust,  the  projected  return  of  each  individual  asset  class  is  then  weighted
according to the allocation to that investment area in the trust’s long-term asset allocation policy.

The assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows:

At December 31,

Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines

The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while
taking into consideration risk and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for
plan  assets  is  designed  so  that 41%  to  51%  of  the  assets  have  the  objective  of  achieving  a  return  in  excess  of  the  growth  in
liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds, high yield bonds and emerging market debt)
and  55%  to  65%  of  the  assets  are  invested  as  liability  hedging  assets  (where  interest  rate  sensitivity  of  the  liability  hedging
assets  better  match  the  interest  rate  sensitivity  of  the  liability)  and  a  maximum  of  10%  is  in  cash.  This  allocation  will  shift  as
funded  status  improves  to  a  higher  allocation  of  liability  hedging  assets. Target  policies  will  be  revisited  periodically  to  ensure
they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market
efficiencies  and  various  other  factors.  Due  to  our  diversification  and  risk  control  processes,  there  are  no  significant
concentrations of risk, in terms of sector, industry, geography or company names.

Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of Verizon bonds or common stock.

The fair values for the other postretirement benefit plans by asset category at December 31, 2021 are as follows:

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine
the fair value of each major category of assets.

Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds (less than 90 days to maturity), primarily in diversified portfolios
of  investment  grade  money  market  instruments  and  are  valued  using  quoted  market  prices  or  other  valuation  methods.  The
carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments.

Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale
prices on the last business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government
obligations,  corporate  bonds,  international  bonds  and  asset-backed  debt  are  valued  using  matrix  prices  with  input  from
independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and
ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable
such as multiple broker quotes.

Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value
(NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV.
The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan.

The  investment  manager  of  the  entity  values  venture  capital,  corporate  finance  and  natural  resource  limited  partnership
investments. Real estate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real
estate  appraisers  or  the  investment  manager  using  discounted  cash  flows  or  market  comparable  data.  Loans  secured  by
mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned
to these investments are based upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that
might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, estimated fair values might differ significantly from
the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material.

Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on
the last business day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These
securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings.

Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager. These funds are
valued in accordance with the terms of their corresponding offering or private placement memoranda.

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                96

Commingled  funds,  hedge  funds,  venture  capital,  corporate  finance,  natural  resource  and  real  estate  limited  partnership
investments  for  which  fair  value  is  measured  using  the  NAV  per  share  as  a  practical  expedient  are  not  leveled  within  the  fair
value hierarchy but are included in total investments.

Employer Contributions

In  2022,  we  made  no  discretionary  contribution  to  our  qualified  pension  plans,  $53  million  of  contributions  to  our  nonqualified
pension plans and $692 million of contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans. No mandatory qualified pension plans
contributions are expected or required to be made in 2023. In 2023, we expect discretionary qualified pension plan contributions
to be approximately $200 million, nonqualified pension plan contributions are estimated to be insignificant and contributions to
our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $820 million.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:

Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans

We  maintain  four  leveraged  employee  stock  ownership  plans  (ESOP).  We  match  a  certain  percentage  of  eligible  employee
contributions to certain savings plans with shares of our common stock from this ESOP. At December 31, 2022, the number of
allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 43 million. There were no unallocated shares of common stock in this ESOP
at December 31, 2022. All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.

Total savings plan costs were $620 million in 2022, $690 million in 2021 and $730 million in 2020.

Severance, Pension and Benefits (Credits) Charges

During 2022, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur,
we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $1.7 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The credits
were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by a credit of
$7.0 billion due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans
($4.1  billion)  and  postretirement  benefit  plans  ($2.9  billion)  from  a  weighted-average  of  2.9%  at  December  31,  2021  to  a
weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022, a charge of $5.5 billion due to the difference between our estimated and our
actual  return  on  assets  and  a  credit  of  $206  million  due  to  other  actuarial  assumption  adjustments.  During  2022,  we  also
recorded  net  pre-tax  severance  charges  of  $319  million  in  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  in  our  consolidated
statements of income.

During 2021, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.4 billion in our pension and postretirement benefit plans.
The credits were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily driven by
a  credit  of  $1.1  billion  due  to  an  increase  in  our  discount  rate  assumption  used  to  determine  the  current  year  liabilities  of  our
pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020 to a weighted-average
of  2.9%  at  December  31,  2021,  a  credit  of $847  million  due  to  the  difference  between  our  estimated  and  our  actual  return  on
assets  and  a  credit  of $453  million  due  to  other  actuarial  assumption  adjustments.  During  2021,  we  also  recorded  net  pre-tax
severance charges of $233 million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

During  2020,  we  recorded  net  pre-tax  pension  and  benefits  charges  of  $1.6  billion  in  our  pension  and  postretirement  benefit
plans. The charges were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and were primarily
driven by a charge of $3.2 billion due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities
of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 3.3% at December 31, 2019 to a weighted-
average of 2.6% at December 31, 2020, partially offset by a credit of $1.6 billion due to the difference between our estimated and
our actual return on assets. During 2020, we also recorded net pre-tax severance charges of $309 million in Selling, general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

The  effective  income  tax  rate  for  2022  and  2021  was  23.1%.  The  effective  income  tax  rate  for  the  twelve  months  ended
December 31, 2022 was comparable to the similar period in 2021. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily
due to the decrease in income before income taxes in the current period.

The effective income tax rate for 2021 was 23.1% compared to 23.4% for 2020. The decrease in the effective income tax rate
was primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021, partially offset by the non-recurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a
series of legal entity restructurings. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in income
before income taxes in 2021.

At  December  31,  2022,  undistributed  earnings  of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  indefinitely  invested  outside  the  U.S.  amounted  to
approximately $2.5 billion. The majority of Verizon's cash flow is generated from domestic operations and we are not dependent
on foreign cash or earnings to meet our funding requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings
to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in
reserve  in  accordance  with  certain  foreign  jurisdictional  requirements  and  are  unavailable  for  distribution  or  repatriation. As  a
result,  we  have  not  provided  U.S.  deferred  taxes  on  these  undistributed  earnings  because  we  intend  that  they  will  remain
indefinitely  reinvested  outside  of  the  U.S.  and,  therefore  unavailable  for  use  in  funding  U.S.  operations.  Determination  of  the
amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

At  December  31,  2022,  we  had  net  after-tax  loss,  credit,  and  other  carry  forwards  for  income  tax  purposes  of  approximately
$1.9  billion  that  relate  to  federal,  state  and  foreign  taxes.  Of  these  net  after-tax  loss,  credit,  and  other  carry  forwards,
approximately $1.2 billion will expire between 2023 and 2042 and approximately $732 million may be carried forward indefinitely.

During 2022, the valuation allowance decreased approximately $227 million. The $1.3 billion valuation allowance at December
31, 2022, as well as the 2022 activity is primarily related to state and foreign taxes.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

respectively, that if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate.

We recognized the following net after-tax expenses (benefit) related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes:

The  decrease  in  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was  primarily  related  to  the  resolution  of  issues  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service
(IRS)  involving  tax  years  2015-2016  as  well  as  final  purchase  accounting  adjustments  made  in  connection  with  the  2021
acquisition of TracFone. The uncertain tax benefits related to the acquisition of TracFone are the subject of an indemnity from
América Móvil for which there is a corresponding indemnity asset.

Verizon  and/or  its  subsidiaries  file  income  tax  returns  in  the  U.S.  federal  jurisdiction,  and  various  state,  local  and  foreign
jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer, we are under audit by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax
years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2017-2018 and Cellco's U.S. income
tax return for tax years 2017-2019. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2009 in certain states and as early as
2000 outside the U.S. The amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the
expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax examinations
will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible
change cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved.

Note 13. Segment Information

Reportable Segments

We  have  two  reportable  segments  that  we  operate  and  manage  as  strategic  business  units  -  Consumer  and  Business.  We
measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision
maker’s assessment of segment performance.

Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:

Segment

Verizon
Consumer
Group

Verizon
Business
Group

Description

Our Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and
products.  Our  wireless  services  are  provided  across  one  of  the  most  extensive  wireless  networks  in  the
U.S. under the Verizon brand, TracFone brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also
provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states
in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network
through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who
are not served by Fios.

Our  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including
data,  video  and  conferencing  services,  corporate  networking  solutions,  security  and  managed  network
services,  local  and  long  distance  voice  services  and  network  access  to  deliver  various  IoT  services  and
products. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and
services  to  businesses,  government  customers  and  wireless  and  wireline  carriers  across  the  U.S.  and
select products and services to customers around the world.

Our Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers
that  purchase  wireless  network  access  from  us  on  a  wholesale  basis.  Our  Business  segment’s  wireless  and  wireline  products
and  services  are  organized  by  the  primary  customer  groups  targeted  by  these  offerings: Small  and  Medium  Business,  Global
Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale.

Corporate  and  other  primarily  includes  insurance  captives,  investments  in  unconsolidated  businesses  and  development  stage
businesses that support our strategic initiatives, as well as unallocated corporate expenses, certain pension and other employee
benefit  related  costs  and  interest  and  financing  expenses.  Corporate  and  other  also  includes  the  historical  results  of  divested
businesses including Verizon Media, and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment
performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included
in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in
segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance.

We  completed  the  sale  of  Verizon  Media  on  September  1,  2021.  See  Note  3  for  additional  information  on  the  sale  of  Verizon
Media.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021  and  2020.  International  operating  revenues  were  not  significant  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022,  2021  and
2020. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, international long-lived assets were not significant.

The chief operating decision maker does not review disaggregated assets on a segment basis; therefore, such information is not
presented.  Depreciation  and  amortization  included  in  the  measure  of  segment  profitability  is  primarily  allocated  based  on
proportional usage, and is included within Total reportable segment operating income.

Note 14. Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Equity

Common Stock

In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million
shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million
or  a  new  share  repurchase  plan  superseding  the  current  plan  is  authorized,  whichever  is  sooner.  During  the  years  ended
December  31,  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  we  did  not  repurchase  any  shares  of  our  common  stock  under  our  authorized  share
buyback program. At December 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon
under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we issued 2.1 million, 2.1 million and 2.3 million shares of common
stock from treasury stock, which had aggregate values of $91 million, $91 million and $101 million, respectively.

In connection with our acquisition of TracFone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of our common
stock from treasury stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion. See Note 3 for additional information.

Noncontrolling Interests

During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  Verizon  entered  into  and  completed  agreements  to  acquire  additional  interests  in
certain  controlled  wireless  partnerships  for  cash  consideration  of $508  million.  Verizon  continues  to  retain  controlling  financial
interest within these partnerships; therefore, the changes in ownership interest were accounted for as equity transactions. This
resulted in a reduction of additional paid-in capital of $450 million, reflected in Other, and a reduction of noncontrolling interest of
$58 million, reflected in Distributions and other, both within our consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended
December 31, 2022. These transactions were recorded within Other, net cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded
from net income. Significant changes in the components of Other comprehensive income (loss), net of provision for income taxes
are described below.

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies

In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state
and  federal  level.  Where  it  is  determined,  in  consultation  with  counsel  based  on  litigation  and  settlement  risks,  that  a  loss  is
probable and estimable in a given matter, Verizon establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount
of  accrual  material.  An  estimate  of  the  reasonably  possible  loss  or  range  of  loss  in  excess  of  the  amounts  already  accrued
cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and
demands;  (2)  a  less  than  complete  factual  record;  (3)  uncertainty  concerning  legal  theories  and  their  resolution  by  courts  or
regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings
as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending
regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect
on our results of operations for a given reporting period.

Verizon is currently involved in approximately 25 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents.
Most  of  these  cases  are  brought  by  non-practicing  entities  and  effectively  seek  only  monetary  damages;  a  small  number  are
brought by companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well. These cases have progressed to various
stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.

In  connection  with  the  execution  of  agreements  for  the  sales  of  businesses  and  investments,  Verizon  ordinarily  provides
representations  and  warranties  to  the  purchasers  pertaining  to  a  variety  of  nonfinancial  matters,  such  as  ownership  of  the
securities  being  sold,  as  well  as  indemnity  from  certain  financial  losses.  From  time  to  time,  counterparties  may  make  claims
under  these  provisions,  and  Verizon  will  seek  to  defend  against  those  claims  and  resolve  them  in  the  ordinary  course  of
business.

As  of  December  31,  2022,  letters  of  credit  totaling  approximately  $834  million,  which  were  executed  in  the  normal  course  of
business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.

During  2022,  Verizon  entered  into  four  renewable  energy  purchase  agreements  (REPAs)  with  third  parties,  in  addition  to  20
signed in previous years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and
has a fixed price term of 12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Seven of the
facilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPAs generally are expected
to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities.

We  have  various  unconditional  purchase  obligations,  which  represent  agreements  to  purchase  goods  or  services  that  are
enforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of
one  year,  total  $24.5  billion,  and  primarily  represent  commitments  to  purchase  network  equipment,  software  and  services,
content,  marketing  services  and  other  items  which  will  be  used  or  sold  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  from  a  variety  of
suppliers. Of this total amount, $9.4 billion is attributable to 2023, $6.9 billion is attributable to 2024, $5.5 billion is attributable to
2025, $1.4 billion is attributable to 2026, $772 million is attributable to 2027 and $524 million is attributable to years thereafter.
These  amounts  do  not  represent  our  entire  anticipated  purchases  in  the  future,  but  represent  only  those  items  that  are  the

Verizon 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K                                106

subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities to which
we are contractually obliged. Since the commitments to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast
stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31,
2022, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed
with no firm commitment.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls
and  procedures  (as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  of  the  Securities  Exchange Act  of  1934),  as  of  the  end  of  the
period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in
this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal
control  established  in  Internal  Control–Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the
Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes
to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020,
we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of
our existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data
analysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.

As  the  phased  implementation  of  the  new  ERP  system  continues,  we  could  have  changes  to  our  processes  and  procedures
which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate
quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

There were no changes in Verizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2022 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Verizon Communications Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting of Verizon. Management has evaluated internal control over financial reporting of Verizon using the criteria for
effective  internal  control  established  in  Internal  Control–Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.

Management  has  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  Verizon’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2022.
Based  on  this  assessment,  management  believes  that  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  of  Verizon  is  effective  as  of
December 31, 2022. In connection with this assessment, there were no material weaknesses in Verizon’s internal control over
financial reporting identified by management. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,
has provided an attestation report on Verizon’s internal control over financial reporting and is included in Item 8 of this Annual
Report.
