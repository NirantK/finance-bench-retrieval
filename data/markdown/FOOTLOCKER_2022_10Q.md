CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  includes  “forward-looking”  statements  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995.  Forward-looking  statements  can  be  identified  by  the  fact  that  they  do  not  relate  strictly  to
historical  or  current  facts.  They  often  include  words  such  as  “believes,”  “expects,”  “anticipates,”  “estimates,”  “intends,”
“plans,” “seeks,” “continues,” “feels,” “forecasts,” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,”
“should,” “could,” “may,” “aims,” “intends,” or “projects.” Statements may be forward looking even in the absence of these
particular words.

Examples  of  forward-looking  statements  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  statements  regarding  our  financial  position,
business  strategy,  and  other  plans  and  objectives  for  our  future  operations,  and  generation  of  free  cash  flow.  These
forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  our  current  expectations  and  beliefs  concerning  future  developments  and  their
potential  effect  on  us.  The  forward-looking  statements  contained  herein  are  largely  based  on  our  expectations  for  the
future,  which  reflect  certain  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by  our  management.  These  estimates  and  assumptions
reflect  our  best  judgment  based  on  currently  known  market  conditions,  operating  trends,  and  other  factors.  Although  we
believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties  that  are  beyond  our  control.  As  such,  management’s  assumptions  about  future  events  may  prove  to  be
inaccurate.

We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events,
changes in circumstances, or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to
us, or persons acting on our behalf. Management cautions you that the forward-looking statements contained herein are
not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure you that such statements will be realized or that the events
and  circumstances  they  describe  will  occur.  Factors  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those
anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, a change in the relationship
with  any  of  our  key  suppliers,  including  the  unavailability  of  premium  products  at  competitive  prices,  volume  discounts,
cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, or ability to cancel orders and return merchandise; our ability to fund our
planned capital investments; volatility in the financial markets or other global economic factors; difficulties in appropriately
allocating  capital  and  resources  among  our  strategic  opportunities;  our  ability  to  realize  the  expected  benefits  from
acquisitions; business opportunities and expansion; investments; expenses; dividends; share repurchases; liquidity; cash
flow  from  operations;  use  of  cash  and  cash  requirements;  borrowing  capacity;  repatriation  of  cash  to  the  United  States;
supply  chain  issues,  including  delays  in  merchandise  receipts  and  increasing  cost  pressure  caused  by  higher  oceanic
shipping and freight costs; labor shortages; expectations regarding increased wages; inflation; consumer spending levels;
the  effect  of  governmental  assistance  programs;  social  unrest;  continuing  risks  relating  to  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19
pandemic, including vaccines and safety protocols; expectations regarding increasing global taxes; the effect of increased
government regulation and changes in law; the effect of the adverse outcome of any material litigation against us or judicial
decisions that affect us or our industry generally; the effects of weather; climate change; ESG risks; increased competition;
geopolitical events; the financial effect of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; credit risk relating to the
risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties; and any other factors set forth in the section entitled “Risk
Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary
statement. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those
future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which
speak to our views only as of the date of this filing. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about
or that we currently consider to be insignificant may also affect our business operations and financial performance.

Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business and any investment in our securities. Given
these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of actual results. Any or all
of  the  forward-looking  statements  contained  in  this  report,  or  any  other  public  statement  made  by  us,  including  by  our
management, may turn out to be incorrect. We are including this cautionary note to make applicable and take advantage of
the  safe  harbor  provisions  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995  for  forward-looking  statements.  We
expressly  disclaim  any  obligation  to  update  or  revise  any  forward-looking  statements,  whether  as  a  result  of  new
information, future events, or otherwise.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the
opinion  of  management,  the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  include  all  normal,  recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. As used in these
Notes  to  the  Unaudited  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  the  terms  “Foot  Locker,”  “Company,”
“we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Foot Locker, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  accompanying
Unaudited  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  these  Notes  and  related  disclosures.  Actual
results  may  differ  from  those  estimates.  The  results  of  operations  for  any  interim  period  are  not  necessarily
indicative of the results expected for the year.

The results of operations for the period ended October 29, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be  expected  for  the  full  fiscal  year  due  to  the  continued  uncertainty  of  general  economic  conditions  that  may
affect us for the remainder of 2022.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2021 Form 10-K.

There  were  no  significant  changes  to  the  policies  disclosed  in  Note  1,  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting
Policies of our 2021 Form 10-K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material
effect on our present or future consolidated financial statements.

2. Acquisitions

In  2021,  we  acquired  WSS  and  atmos,  two  businesses  that  will  allow  us  to  further  differentiate  our  product
offerings, as well as our customer base, and diversify our retail store and omnichannel portfolio.

WSS

During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, we paid an additional $4 million upon the finalization of
the  value  of  net  assets  acquired,  with  a  corresponding  increase  to  goodwill  as  compared  with  the  amounts
presented in the most recent annual report. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition has increased to
$811 million ($741 million, net of cash acquired). During the third quarter of 2022, we recorded changes to the
value of net assets acquired related to income tax balances.

During  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022,  we  paid  an  additional  $6  million  and
$14  million,  respectively,  in  connection  with  the  finalization  of  certain  post-closing  conditions.  The  aggregate
purchase  price  for  the  acquisition  has  increased  to  $374  million,  subject  to  additional  adjustments  for  the
finalization of the value of net assets acquired and other post-closing matters. The preliminary purchase price
includes contingent consideration initially measured at $35 million, which can reach up to $111 million based on
achieving  certain  revenue  growth  and  EBITDA  performance  targets.  The  fair  value  of  the  contingent
consideration  has  not  changed  from  the  initial  measurement.  The  preliminary  purchase  price  does  not  yet
reflect the finalization of the net working capital provisions and other post-closing adjustments. At closing, we
placed  $30  million  in  escrow,  of  which  $10  million  related  to  net  working  capital  adjustments  and  $20  million
related to certain indemnifications. The net working capital adjustment will be finalized during the fourth quarter
and the indemnification escrow will be released in May 2023, unless there is a pending claim.

The following table represents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for atmos and includes fair value
adjustments to certain assets and liabilities since our most recent annual report. Changes to amounts reported
at  year  end  included  a  $14  million  increase  in  goodwill  due  to  the  additional  purchase  price,  a  $5  million
downward  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  and  other  changes  of  $2  million.  These  adjustments  did  not  have  a
significant effect on the consolidated results of operations. We determined that the atmos tradenames will have
an indefinite life and will not be amortized.

We are assessing the tax deductibility of the goodwill related to the acquisition.

We sell gift cards, which do not have expiration dates. Revenue from gift card sales is recorded when the gift
cards  are  redeemed  by  customers.  Breakage  income  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  proportion  to  the  pattern  of
rights exercised by the customer. The table below presents the activity of our gift card liability balance.

4. Segment Information

We have integrated all available shopping channels including stores, websites, apps, and social channels. Store
sales  are  primarily  fulfilled  from  the  store’s  inventory,  but  may  also  be  shipped  from  any  of  our  distribution
centers  or  from  a  different  store  location  if  an  item  is  not  available  at  the  original  store.  Direct-to-customer
orders are generally shipped to our customers through our distribution centers but may also be shipped from
any store or a combination of our distribution centers and stores depending on availability.

We  evaluate  performance  based  on  several  factors,  primarily  the  banner’s  financial  results,  referred  to  as
division  profit.  Division  profit  reflects  income  before  income  taxes,  impairment  and  other  charges,  corporate
expense, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

For  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022,  we  incurred  $17  million  and  $27  million  of
transformation  consulting  expense,  respectively.  We  recorded  $1  million  and  $4  million  in  acquisition  and
integration  costs  related  to  WSS  and  atmos  for  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022,
respectively. We recorded reorganization costs, primarily severance, of $2 million for both the thirteen and thirty-
nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, related to the announced closure of a North American distribution center.
Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $5 million related to long-lived assets and right-of-use assets,
as well as accelerated tenancy charges for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022.

For  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  30,  2021  we  recorded  $13  million  and  $52  million  of
impairment  charges  related  to  the  decision  to  exit  the  Footaction  banner,  respectively.  Impairment  of
investments  was  $30  million  and  $32  million  for  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  30,  2021,
respectively, due to continued losses and updated estimates of value. In connection with the acquisitions, we
recorded  costs  of  $14  million,  for  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  30,  2021.  We  recorded
charges of $4 million in lease-related termination costs, and a severance charge of $2 million in connection with
the reorganization of certain support functions, offset by $7 million of insurance recovery income related to 2020
social unrest losses for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021.

6. Other Income / (Expense), net

Effective June 27, 2022, the Company reached a definitive agreement to sell all assets related to the Eastbay
Team Sales business, consisting primarily of inventory and accounts receivable. During the second quarter, we
received proceeds of $47 million from the transaction. During the third quarter we finalized the net assets sold
to purchasers increasing the gain to $19 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022.

7. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash (continued)

Amounts  included  in  restricted  cash  primarily  relate  to  amounts  held  in  escrow  in  connection  with  various
leasing arrangements in Europe and deposits held in insurance trusts to satisfy the requirement to collateralize
part of the self-insured workers’ compensation and liability claims.

8. Goodwill

See footnote 2, Acquisitions, for additional information on our recent acquisitions.

In  conjunction  with  the  sale  of  the  Eastbay  Team  Sales  business,  we  allocated  $6  million  of  goodwill  to  the
assets sold, representing the allocable share of the fair value of the reporting unit disposed of.

We  review  goodwill  for  impairment  annually  during  the  first  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year,  or  more  frequently  if
impairment  indicators  arise.  The  review  of  impairment  consists  of  either  using  a  qualitative  approach  to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying
values  or  a  one-step  quantitative  impairment  test.  The  results  of  the  first  quarter  analysis  did  not  result  in  an
impairment since the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

relation to the U.S. dollar.

(2) During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to the Footaction tradename.

In  connection  with  the  acquisitions  of  WSS  and  atmos,  we  recognized  indefinite  life  intangible  assets  of
$296  million  for  WSS  related  tradenames  and  $130  million  for  atmos  related  tradenames.  Additionally,  we
recognized customer list intangible assets of $13 million for WSS and $9 million for atmos, both of which will be
amortized over 3 years. The intangibles related to atmos were originally recorded at the exchange rate in effect
as of the date of acquisition and are presented in the above table at current period exchange rates. Amortizing
intangible assets primarily represent the WSS and atmos customer lists, and lease acquisition costs, which are
amounts that are required to secure prime lease locations and other lease rights, primarily in Europe.

On  May  6,  2022,  we  entered  into  a  cross-currency  swap  contract  to  reduce  the  effect  of  the  fluctuating  U.S.
Dollar  (“USD”)  to  Japanese  Yen  (“JPY”)  foreign  exchange  rate  on  our  foreign  currency-denominated
intercompany loan between our Japanese and U.S. subsidiary. We expect the gains and losses on this contract
to offset losses and gains on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from
the remeasurement of the principal and interest accrued on the loan. Though the intercompany loan eliminates
in consolidation, the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan and interest by the U.S. subsidiary is reflected
in the consolidated financial statements.

The cross-currency swap contract has a notional amount of JPY 11 billion and final receipt of $85 million. The
cross-currency  swap  contract,  which  matures  on  November  2,  2031,  swaps  Yen-denominated  interest
payments  for  U.S.  dollar-denominated  interest  payments,  thereby  economically  converting  the  JPY  11  billion
fixed-rate 3.51% intercompany loan to a fixed-rate 6.77% USD-denominated receivable for our U.S. subsidiary.

We designated the cross-currency swap contract to hedge the changes in value of the intercompany loan and
its variability on earnings. We will apply fair value hedge accounting, and we will consider market factors other
than the change in the spot exchange rate on the notional amount of the swap to be excluded components. The
foreign  currency  spot  rate  fluctuations  on  the  cross-currency  swap  notional  amount  and  interest  accruals  are
reported in earnings each period, while all other changes are reported in other comprehensive income. Because
the terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument match and the likelihood of swap counterparty default
is not probable, the hedge is expected to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the foreign currency debt
resulting from to foreign currency fluctuations over the term of the swap.

As of October 29, 2022, the cross-currency swap had a fair value of $4 million and was included in other assets.
We record the changes in the fair value of the contract to AOCL. Each period, we reclassify an amount out of
AOCL  equal  to  the  remeasurement  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedged  intercompany  loan  that  is  recorded  in  selling,
general and administrative expenses. As of October 29, 2022, there was $4 million in AOCL, net of tax, related
to  the  cross-currency  swap.  In  addition,  we  recognize  swap  interest  income  based  on  the  differential  in  fixed
interest  rates  per  the  contract.  For  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022,  we  recorded
$1 million and $2 million of income in interest expense, net, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for further information
regarding amounts recorded in AOCL.

12. Fair Value Measurements

Our financial assets are recorded at fair value, using a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are categorized as follows:

Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for
similar  instruments  in  active  markets;  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  instruments  in
markets  that  are  not  active;  and  model-derived  valuations  in  which  all  significant  inputs  or
significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.

Level 3 – Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are

unobservable.

In 2021, we invested $68 million to take a common stock minority stake in a public entity, Retailors, Ltd, which is
traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. This investment is classified as a Level 1 instrument since the fair value
is readily available in an active market.

The fair value of the auction rate security, classified as available-for-sale, is determined by using quoted prices
for similar instruments in active markets and accordingly is classified as a Level 2 instrument.

The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the atmos acquisition is estimated using
an  option  pricing  model  simulation  that  determines  an  average  projected  payment  value  across  numerous
iterations.

Our derivative financial instruments are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation
models  require  a  variety  of  inputs,  including  contractual  terms,  market  prices,  yield  curves,  and  measures  of
volatility and, therefore, are classified as Level 2 instruments.

12. Fair Value Measurements (continued)

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets  and  liabilities  recognized  or  disclosed  at  fair  value  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  on  a
nonrecurring  basis  include  items  such  as  property,  plant  and  equipment,  operating  lease  right-of-use  assets,
goodwill, other intangible assets, and minority investments that are not accounted for under the equity method
of  accounting.  These  assets  are  measured  using  Level  3  inputs,  if  determined  to  be  impaired.  Minority
investments measured using the fair value measurement alternative had a carrying value of $579 million and
$618 million as of October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, respectively.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs
or  significant  value  drivers  are  observable  in  active  markets  and,  therefore,  are  classified  as  Level  2.  The
balance as of October 29, 2022 includes the $400 million 4% Notes. The carrying value and estimated fair value
of long-term debt were as follows:

The carrying value of debt as of October 29, 2022 reflects $5 million of issuer’s discount and costs related to the 4% Notes.

The  carrying  values  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  other  current  receivables  and  payables  approximate
their fair value.

13. Earnings Per Share

We account for earnings per share (“EPS”) using the treasury stock method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing
net  income  for  the  period  by  the  weighted-average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding  at  the  end  of  the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the  period  used  in  the  basic  EPS  computation  plus  dilutive  common  stock  equivalents.  The  computation  of

(1) On August 24, 2022, the Company granted options and other awards to its new President and Chief Executive Officer, Mary N. Dillon. These awards were
granted outside of the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan as employment inducement awards and do not require shareholder approval under the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange or otherwise. Shares available for future grant under this plan are reserved for the sole purpose to issue shares pursuant to her
employment inducement awards.

The total fair value of options vested October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021 was $4 million for both periods.
The  cash  received  from  option  exercises  during  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022
were $1 million and $4 million, respectively. The related tax benefits realized from option exercises during the
thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022  were  not  significant.  The  cash  received  from  option
exercises during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021 were not significant and $10 million,
respectively.  The  related  tax  benefits  realized  from  option  exercises  during  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks
ended October 30, 2021 were not significant and $2 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units

Restricted  stock  units  (“RSU”)  are  awarded  to  certain  officers,  key  employees  of  the  Company,  and
nonemployee  directors.  Additionally,  performance  stock  units  (“PSU”)  are  awarded  to  officers  and  certain  key
employees  in  connection  with  our  long-term  incentive  program.  Each  RSU  and  PSU  represents  the  right  to
receive  one  share  of  our  common  stock  provided  that  the  applicable  performance  and  vesting  conditions  are
satisfied.  PSU  awards  granted  in  2022  also  include  a  performance  objective  based  on  our  relative  total
shareholder return over the performance period to a pre-determined peer group, assuming the reinvestment of
dividends. The fair value of these awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the date of the
grant and share-based compensation expense will not be adjusted should the target awards vary from actual
awards.

Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 18

Table of Contents

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

15. Share-Based Compensation (continued)

Generally, RSU awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years for employees and one year for
nonemployee directors, provided there is continued service with the Company until the vesting date, subject to
the terms of the award. PSU awards are earned only after the attainment of performance goals in connection
with  the  relevant  performance  period  and  vest  after  an  additional  one-year  period.  No  dividends  are  paid  or
accumulated on any RSU or PSU awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period.

The total value of RSU and PSU awards that vested during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022 and
October 30, 2021 was $6 million and $23 million, respectively. As of October 29, 2022, there was $37 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards.

16. Legal Proceedings

Legal  proceedings  pending  against  the  Company  or  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  consist  of  ordinary,  routine
litigation,  including  administrative  proceedings,  incidental  to  the  business  of  the  Company  or  businesses  that
have  been  sold  or  discontinued  by  the  Company  in  past  years.  These  legal  proceedings  include  commercial,
intellectual property, customer, environmental, and employment-related claims. Additionally, the Company is a
defendant in a purported wage/hour and wage statement violation class action in California.

We  do  not  believe  that  the  outcome  of  any  such  legal  proceedings  pending  against  the  Company  or  its
consolidated  subsidiaries,  as  described  above,  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated
financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole, based upon current knowledge and taking
into  consideration  current  accruals.  Litigation  is  inherently  unpredictable.  Judgments  could  be  rendered  or
settlements  made  that  could  adversely  affect  the  Company’s  operating  results  or  cash  flows  in  a  particular
period.

17. Subsequent Events

Subsequent  to  the  end  of  the  third  quarter,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  to  sell  its  shares  in
Retailors, Ltd. at a discount to the publicly traded value. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately
$84 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Overview

Foot  Locker,  Inc.  leads  the  celebration  of  sneaker  and  youth  culture  around  the  globe  through  a  portfolio  of
brands  including  Foot  Locker,  Lady  Foot  Locker,  Kids  Foot  Locker,  Champs  Sports,  Eastbay,  atmos,  WSS,
Footaction, and Sidestep. As of October 29, 2022, we operated 2,794 primarily mall-based stores, as well as
stores  in  high-traffic  urban  retail  areas  and  high  streets,  in  28  countries  across  the  United  States,  Canada,
Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, as well as websites and mobile apps. Our purpose is to inspire and
empower youth culture around the world, by fueling a shared passion for self-expression and creating unrivaled
experiences at the heart of the global sneaker community.

We  use  our  omni-channel  capabilities  to  bridge  the  digital  world  and  physical  stores,  including  order-in-store,
buy  online  and  pickup-in-store,  and  buy  online  and  ship-from-store,  as  well  as  e-commerce.  We  operate
websites  and  mobile  apps  aligned  with  the  brand  names  of  our  store  banners  including  footlocker.com,
kidsfootlocker.com,  champssports.com,  atmosusa.com,  shopwss.com  and  related  e-commerce  sites  in  the
various international countries that we operate. These sites offer some of the largest online product selections
and  provide  a  seamless  link  between  e-commerce  and  physical  stores.  We  also  operate  the  website  for
eastbay.com.

Store Count

At October 29, 2022, we operated 2,794 stores as compared with 2,858 and 2,956 stores at January 29, 2022
and October 30, 2021, respectively.

Franchise Operations

A total of 155 franchised stores were operating at October 29, 2022, as compared with 142 and 136 stores at
January  29,  2022  and  October  30,  2021,  respectively,  operating  in  the  Middle  East  and  Asia.  Revenue  from
franchised  stores  was  not  significant  for  any  of  the  periods  presented.  These  stores  are  not  included  in  the
operating store count above.

Leadership Transition

As part of a planned succession process, Richard A. Johnson retired as President and Chief Executive Officer,
effective  September  1,  2022.  Mary  N.  Dillon,  former  Executive  Chair  and  CEO  of  Ulta  Beauty,  Inc.,  was
appointed  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  member  of  the  Foot  Locker  Board,  also  effective
September 1, 2022.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

In  addition  to  reporting  our  financial  results  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
(“GAAP”), we report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. We have presented
certain  financial  measures  identified  as  non-GAAP,  such  as  sales  changes  excluding  foreign  currency
fluctuations,  adjusted  income  before  income  taxes,  adjusted  net  income,  and  adjusted  diluted  earnings  per
share.

We present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered
non-GAAP measures. Where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations,
such  changes  are  determined  by  translating  all  amounts  in  both  years  using  the  prior-year  average  foreign
exchange  rates.  Presenting  amounts  on  a  constant  currency  basis  is  useful  to  investors  because  it  enables
them to better understand the changes in our business that are not related to currency movements.

Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 20

Table of Contents

These  non-GAAP  measures  are  presented  because  we  believe  they  assist  investors  in  comparing  our
performance  across  reporting  periods  on  a  consistent  basis  by  excluding  items  that  we  do  not  believe  are
indicative  of  our  core  business  or  affect  comparability.  In  addition,  these  non-GAAP  measures  are  useful  in
assessing  our  progress  in  achieving  our  long-term  financial  objectives.  We  estimate  the  tax  effect  of  all  non-
GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete
amount  that  affected  the  period.  The  non-GAAP  financial  information  is  provided  in  addition,  and  not  as  an
alternative, to our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Effective with the first quarter of 2022, the calculation for non-GAAP earnings excludes gains and losses from
all minority investments, including the adjustments related to the investment in Retailors, Ltd. We believe this is
a  more  representative  measure  of  our  recurring  earnings,  assists  in  the  comparability  of  results,  and  is
consistent with how management reviews performance. The non-GAAP results for 2021 have been recast, as
applicable, to conform to the current year’s presentation. As we report quarterly results through 2022, we will
provide  updated  non-GAAP  reconciliations  for  the  corresponding  prior  year’s  quarter  under  this  revised
definition.

Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP.

During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $20 million
and  $38  million,  respectively,  classified  as  Impairment  and  Other.  See  the  Impairment  and  Other  Charges
section for further information.

The  adjustments  made  to  other  income  /  (expense),  net  reflect  gains  or  losses  primarily  associated  with  our

In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded a $5 million charge related to our income tax reserves due to the
resolution of a foreign tax settlement.

Segment Reporting

We  have  determined  that  we  have  three  operating  segments,  North  America,  EMEA,  and  Asia  Pacific.  Our
North  America  operating  segment  includes  the  results  of  the  following  banners  operating  in  the  U.S.  and
Canada:  Foot  Locker,  Kids  Foot  Locker,  Lady  Foot  Locker,  Champs  Sports,  WSS,  and  Footaction,  including
each of their related e-commerce businesses, as well as our Eastbay business. Our EMEA operating segment
includes the results of the following banners operating in Europe: Foot Locker, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker,
including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results
of the Foot Locker banner and its related e-commerce business operating in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia,
as well as atmos, which operates primarily in Asia. We have further aggregated these operating segments into
one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.

Results of Operations

We  evaluate  performance  based  on  several  factors,  primarily  the  banner’s  financial  results,  referred  to  as
division  profit.  Division  profit  reflects  income  before  income  taxes,  impairment  and  other  charges,  corporate
expenses, non-operating income, and net interest expense.

Sales

All  references  to  comparable-store  sales  for  a  given  period  relate  to  sales  of  stores  that  were  open  at  the
period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable sales also
includes  our  direct-to-customers  channel.  Stores  opened  or  closed  during  the  period  are  not  included  in  the
comparable-store  base;  however,  stores  closed  temporarily  for  relocation  or  remodeling  are  included.  Stores
that  were  temporarily  closed  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  are  also  included  in  the  computation  of
comparable-store sales. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.

Sales  from  acquired  businesses  that  include  inventory  are  included  in  the  computation  of  comparable-store
sales  after  15  months  of  operations.  Accordingly,  sales  of  WSS  and  atmos  have  been  excluded  from  the
computation  of  comparable-store  sales.  As  a  result  of  the  Eastbay  Team  Sales  divestiture,  sales  from  this
business were removed for the computation of comparable sales for all periods.

For the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2022, total sales decreased by $16 million, or 0.7%, to $2,173 million,
as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, total
sales  decreased  by  $204  million,  or  3.1%,  to  $6,413  million,  as  compared  with  the  corresponding  prior-year

Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 23

Table of Contents

Despite the decline in sales as compared with our record levels in 2021, sales exceeded the results of 2019.
Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and our acquisitions, sales increased by 4.5% and by
2.2%  for  the  quarter  and  year-to-date  periods,  respectively,  as  compared  with  the  corresponding  periods  of
2019.

Comparable sales increased in our stores, however sales decreased in our direct-to-customer channel for the
quarter  and  year-to-date  periods  of  2022.  Our  sales  in  stores  increased,  driven  by  strong  demand,  brand
diversification efforts, and improved access to high-quality inventory. Our direct-to-customer channel continued
to decrease as shoppers navigated back to physical locations.

Our  North  American  operating  segment’s  sales,  excluding  WSS,  and  comparable-store  sales  for  the  current
year were negatively affected by the significant fiscal stimulus, which contributed to last year’s growth, as well
as  the  effects  of  inflation  on  customer  demand.  Additionally,  the  wind  down  of  the  Footaction  business
negatively  affected  sales,  last  year  we  operated  161  stores  as  compared  with  11  this  quarter.  Within  EMEA,
sales from the Foot Locker banner increased as tourism returned to more historical levels driving traffic back to
our stores. The overall positive comparable sales for EMEA was partly offset by continued decline in sales from
the  Sidestep  banner,  which  generated  a  negative  decline  in  comparable  sales  for  the  quarter.  Asia  Pacific,
excluding atmos, generated increases from both strong performance in Australia and New Zealand compared to
last  year’s  COVID-19  related  store  closures,  coupled  with  growth  in  Asia,  based  on  expansion  in  that  region.
Asia Pacific’s increases were affected by the increase in operating days, the current year was essentially open
for all days as compared with approximately 56% and 75% for the quarter and year-to-date periods last year,
respectively.

From a product perspective, for the combined channels for the quarter, increased sales from footwear product
was offset by a decline in apparel sales, while sales of accessories were essentially flat.  For the year-to-date
period, the decline in sales was primarily from lower footwear and apparel sales, offset, in part, by higher sales
of accessories. The decline in footwear for the third quarter was primarily due to lower sales from men’s and
kids’  running  footwear  products,  and  the  decline  in  sales  of  apparel  represented  lower  sales  of  men’s  and
performance apparel products. For the year-to-date period, men’s, kids’, and performance footwear decreased,
offset  by  a  small  increase  in  sales  of  women’s  footwear.  Apparel  sales  decreased  in  the  men’s,  kids’,  and
performance categories, while sales of women’s product increased.

Gross  margin  is  calculated  as  sales  minus  cost  of  sales.  Cost  of  sales  includes:  the  cost  of  merchandise,
freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’
compensation.  Occupancy  costs  include  rent  (including  fixed  common  area  maintenance  charges  and  other
fixed non-lease components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.

The gross margin rate decreased to 32.0% for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2022, as compared with
the corresponding prior-year period, reflecting a 280-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate, and
a  10-basis  point  leverage  in  the  occupancy  and  buyers’  compensation  rate.  For  the  thirty-nine  weeks  ended
October 29, 2022, the gross margin rate declined by 230 basis points, reflecting a 210-basis point decrease in
the merchandise margin rate and a 20-basis point deleverage in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate.

Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 24

The declines in merchandise margin rate reflected higher markdowns versus historically-low levels last year and
higher  supply  chain  costs.  Additionally,  merchandise  margin  is  negatively  affected  by  the  recent  acquisitions
that generate a lower rate, which is offset by lower occupancy costs and therefore does not significantly affect
the overall gross margin rate. The occupancy rate also reflected the effect of prior year rent abatements related
to  COVID-19  that  represented  $3  million  and  $14  million  for  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  weeks  of  last  year,
respectively, as compared with insignificant amounts this year.

thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2022, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. For the year-to-
date period SG&A increased by $56 million, or $109 million excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
Our  newly  acquired  businesses  contributed  $44  million  and  $116  million  for  the  quarter  and  year-to-date
periods, respectively, to the overall increase. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased by 60 basis points and
150 basis points for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, respectively, driven by higher
labor  costs,  information  technology  and  support  expenses,  and  COVID-19  related  matters  in  the  prior  year,
partially offset by early savings from our cost optimization program.

SG&A for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022 included nominal payroll subsidies from
local  governments,  compared  with  $1  million  and  $15  million  for  the  corresponding  prior-year  periods,

atmos.

Impairment and Other Charges

Transformation consulting charges were $17 million and $27 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2022, respectively. Impairment of long-lived assets and right-of-use assets was not significant and

For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021, impairment of investments was $30 million and
$32 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021, respectively, due to continued losses
and updated estimates of value for the Company’s minority investments. We recorded charges of $4 million in
lease-related termination costs, and a severance charge of $2 million in connection with the reorganization of
certain support functions, offset by $7 million of insurance recovery income related to 2020 social unrest losses
for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 30, 2021.

and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, respectively, with both sales channels experiencing declines in
gross margin and deleveraging expenses. WSS and atmos generated division profit of $8 million and $4 million,
respectively  for  the  third  quarter,  and  $28  million  and  $21  million  for  the  year-to-date  period.  WSS’  division
results for the prior year period was not significant as the acquisition occurred during the quarter.

Our Sidestep business has been underperforming and management is currently reviewing strategic actions to
assess  this  operation.  Management  will  monitor  the  results  of  this  business  during  the  fourth  quarter  and  will
assess,  if  necessary,  the  effect  of  various  initiatives  on  the  projected  performance  of  this  division,  which  may

The thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2022 reflected a gain of $1 million from the divestiture of Eastbay Team
Sales, and a $15 million loss on minority investments, primarily the decline in the fair value of our Retailors, Ltd.
investment. The thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022 reflected the gain from the divestiture of $19 million,
a decline in our Retailors, Ltd. investment of $52 million, partially offset by $1 million of dividend income.

Other income / (expense), net also includes $3 million and $9 million of franchise income for the thirteen and

Our current year interim provision for income taxes was measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate,
which represented a blend of federal, state, and foreign taxes and included the effect of certain nondeductible
items as well as changes in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings or losses, adjusted for discrete items that
occurred within the periods presented.

We regularly assess the adequacy of our provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with applicable
authoritative  guidance  on  accounting  for  income  taxes.  As  a  result,  we  may  adjust  the  reserves  for
unrecognized  tax  benefits  considering  new  facts  and  developments,  such  as  changes  to  interpretations  of
relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes
of limitation.

In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded a $5 million charge related to our income tax reserves due to the
resolution of a foreign tax settlement.  Partially offsetting this charge were tax benefits totaling $2 million from
reserves releases due to various statute of limitation lapses. The changes in tax reserves were not significant
for any of the prior-year periods.

We also recorded a tax expense of $6 million in connection with Eastbay Team Sales divestiture, including the
effect of a non-deductible goodwill write-off, that occurred in the second quarter.

During  the  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022,  we  recorded  $1  million  of  expense  related  to  tax
deficiencies from share-based compensation, as compared with an excess tax benefit of $2 million recorded in
the corresponding prior-year period.

Excluding the above-mentioned discrete items, the effective tax rates for the current year periods increased, as
compared  with  the  corresponding  prior-year  periods,  primarily  due  to  the  change  in  the  level  and  mix  of
domestic and foreign earnings.

Our effective tax rate will vary due to numerous factors, such as level and geographic mix of income and losses,
acquisitions,  investments,  intercompany  transactions,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  our  stock  price,
changes  in  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  valuation,  changes  in  the  laws,  regulations,
administrative  practices,  principles,  and  interpretations  related  to  tax,  including  changes  to  the  global  tax
framework and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.

On  August  16,  2022,  President  Biden  signed  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  (“IRA”)  of  2022  into  law.  The  IRA
contains a number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1%
excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not currently
expect the IRA tax provisions will have a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been
to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings,
store remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; make retirement
plan  contributions,  quarterly  dividend  payments,  and  interest  payments;  and  fund  other  cash  requirements  to
support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies, including strategic investments.

Third Quarter 2022 Form 10-Q Page 28

Table of Contents

We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow
from  operations,  and  amounts  available  under  our  credit  agreement  will  be  adequate  to  fund  these
requirements.

The Company may also repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through
open  market  purchases,  privately  negotiated  transactions,  or  otherwise.  Share  repurchases  and  retirement  of
debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, strategic
considerations,  and  other  factors.  The  amounts  involved  may  be  material.  As  of  October  29,  2022,
approximately  $1,103  million  remained  available  under  our  current  $1.2  billion  share  repurchase  program,
which was approved in February 2022. The new program does not have an expiration date.

Any  material  adverse  change  in  customer  demand,  fashion  trends,  competitive  market  forces,  or  customer
acceptance  of  our  merchandise  mix,  retail  locations  and  websites,  uncertainties  related  to  the  effect  of
competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise
purchases  and  risks  associated  with  global  product  sourcing,  economic  conditions  worldwide,  the  effects  of
currency fluctuations, continued uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors listed
under  the  headings  “Disclosure  Regarding  Forward-Looking  Statements,”  and  “Risk  Factors”  could  affect  our
ability to continue to fund our needs from business operations.

Operating activities reflects net income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments
to  net  income  for  non-cash  items  include  gains,  losses,  impairment  charges,  other  charges,  depreciation  and
amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.

The  decrease  in  cash  from  operating  activities  reflected  higher  merchandise  purchases  and  payments  of
accounts  payable  and  accrued  and  other  liabilities,  as  well  as  lower  net  income,  as  compared  with  the  same
period last year. Higher merchandise purchases were necessary as our year-end inventory levels were affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated supply chain challenges.

As of October 29, 2022, we have withheld approximately $5 million of lease and lease-related payments as we
continue to negotiate rent deferrals or abatements with our landlords for the period that our stores were closed
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The  change  in  investing  activities  primarily  reflected  the  WSS  acquisition  in  the  prior  year  and  higher  capital
expenditures in the current year, partially offset by divestiture of certain assets. During the third quarter of 2021,
we completed the acquisition of WSS for $737 million, net of cash acquired. During the thirty-nine weeks ended
October 29, 2022, we paid an additional $18 million for the WSS and atmos acquisitions upon the satisfaction of
certain post-closing conditions.

For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, capital expenditures increased by $81 million to $218 million,
as  compared  with  the  corresponding  prior-year  period.  Our  full-year  capital  spending  is  expected  to  be
$265  million.  The  forecast  includes  $182  million  related  to  the  remodeling  or  relocation  of  approximately  140
existing stores and the opening of approximately 110 new stores, as well as $83 million for the development of
information systems, websites, and infrastructure, including supply chain initiatives.

We  have  invested  $5  million  in  minority  investments  during  the  current  year,  including  various  limited  partner
venture  capital  funds  managed  by  Black  fund  managers,  who  are  committed  to  advancing  diverse-led
businesses  as  part  of  our  Leading  in  Education  and  Economic  Development  (LEED)  initiative.  During  the
second  quarter  of  2022,  we  sold  our  position  in  one  of  our  minority  investments  receiving  proceeds  of
$12 million. In the prior-year period, we invested $115 million which was comprised of an additional $33 million
investment in GOAT, a $68 million investment in a public entity (Retailors, Ltd.), and a $14 million investment in
various companies, primarily related to LEED.

Also  during  the  second  quarter  of  2022,  we  sold  our  Eastbay  Team  Sales  business  receiving  proceeds  of
$47 million.

We sold the former Runners Point headquarters in the first quarter of 2021, generating proceeds of $3 million.
Also last year, we received insurance proceeds of $3 million related to property and equipment claims from the
social unrest losses in 2020.

During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2022, we repurchased 4,050,000 shares of common stock for
$129  million  under  our  share  repurchase  programs,  whereas  in  the  prior  year  we  spent  $170  million  to
repurchase shares. We also declared and paid $113 million in dividends representing a quarterly rate of $0.40
per share in 2022, as compared with $72 million in dividends representing quarterly rates of $0.20 per share for
the first two quarters of 2021 and $0.30 per share for the third quarter.

We  paid  $1  million  to  satisfy  tax  withholding  obligations  relating  to  the  vesting  of  share-based  equity  awards
during  the  thirty-nine  weeks  ended  October  29,  2022,  as  compared  with  $11  million  in  2021.  Offsetting  this
amount were proceeds received in connection with employee stock programs of $7 million in the current year,
as compared with $17 million in the prior-year period. Additionally, we paid $5 million of principal on our finance
lease obligations, mainly related to certain WSS stores.

Cash provided by financing activities in the prior-year period consisted primarily of the issuance of the 4% Notes
due 2029, for which we received $395 million in proceeds, net of the initial purchasers’ discount.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information
provided in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
included in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Descriptions  of  the  recently  issued  and  adopted  accounting  principles  are  included  in  Item  1.  “Financial
Statements” in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  to  the  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

During the quarter, the Company’s management performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation  of  the  Company’s  Chief  Executive  Officer  (“CEO”)  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  (“CFO”),  of  the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is
defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the
“Exchange  Act”)).  Based  on  that  evaluation,  the  Company’s  CEO  and  CFO  concluded  that  the  Company’s
disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  effective  to  ensure  that  information  relating  to  the  Company  that  is
required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

During the quarter ended October 29, 2022, there were no changes, other than process changes that may be
necessary related to the newly acquired businesses, in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), that materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Exhibit 99

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Foot Locker, Inc.:

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheets of Foot Locker, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
October  29,  2022  and  October  30,  2021,  the  related  condensed  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  comprehensive
income,  and  changes  in  shareholders’  equity  for  the  thirteen  and  thirty-nine  week  periods  ended  October  29,  2022  and
October  30,  2021,  the  related  condensed  consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows  for  the  thirty-nine  week  periods  ended
October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information).
Based  on  our  reviews,  we  are  not  aware  of  any  material  modifications  that  should  be  made  to  the  consolidated  interim
financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States)  (PCAOB),  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  of  the  Company  as  of  January  29,  2022,  and  the  related  consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended
(not presented herein); and in our report dated March 24, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as
of January 29, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has
been derived.

Basis for Review Results

This  consolidated  interim  financial  information  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s  management.  We  are  a  public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We  conducted  our  reviews  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  A  review  of  consolidated  interim  financial
information  consists  principally  of  applying  analytical  procedures  and  making  inquiries  of  persons  responsible  for  financial
and  accounting  matters.  It  is  substantially  less  in  scope  than  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the
PCAOB,  the  objective  of  which  is  the  expression  of  an  opinion  regarding  the  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
