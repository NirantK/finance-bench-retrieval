Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)

1.   Basis of Presentation

Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms “Best Buy,” “we,” “us” and “our” in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
refers to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation as
prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). All adjustments were comprised of normal recurring adjustments, except as noted in
these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. Due to the
seasonal nature of our business, interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire fiscal year. The interim financial statements and the related
notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023. The first six months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 included 26 weeks.

In preparing the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we evaluated the period from July 29, 2023, through the date the financial
statements were issued for material subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure. No such events were identified.

Sale of Subsidiary

In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed the sale of a Mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in Mexico and recognized a $21 million
gain within Gain on sale of subsidiary, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023.

Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2022-04 (“ASU 2022-04”), Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure
of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. ASU 2022-04 requires entities to disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs they use in connection with the
purchase of goods and services, along with the amount of obligations outstanding at the end of each period and an annual roll-forward of such obligations. Below
are the interim disclosures as a result of ASU 2022-04.

Supply Chain Financing

We have a supply chain financing program with an independent financial institution, whereby some of our suppliers have the opportunity to receive accounts
payable settlements early, at a discount, facilitated by the financial institution. Under this program, the financial institution agrees to terms with our suppliers,
including amounts that are eligible for early payment, the timing of such payments and the discounts. The financial institution then pays the supplier based on the
payment terms agreed to. Suppliers’ participation in this program is at their own option. The financial institution can vary discounts offered at their own discretion.
Our rights and obligations to our suppliers – which are typically formalized in standardized agreements – are not affected by the existence of the program. Our
liability associated with the funded participation in the program, which is included in Accounts payable on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, was
$609 million, $386 million and $731 million as of July 29, 2023, January 28, 2023, and July 30, 2022, respectively.

Total Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are reconciled to the total shown on our Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows ($ in millions):

2.   Restructuring

Fiscal 2023 Resource Optimization Initiative

Table of Contents

In light of ongoing changes in business trends, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we commenced an enterprise-wide initiative to better align our spending
with critical strategies and operations, as well as to optimize our cost structure. We do not expect to incur material future restructuring charges related to this
initiative.

All charges incurred related to this initiative were comprised of employee termination benefits from continuing operations and were presented within Restructuring

Fair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by
observable market data).

Valued at quoted market prices in active markets at period end.

Valued at face value plus accrued interest at period end, which approximates fair value.

Valued using the performance of mutual funds that trade with sufficient frequency and volume to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of cash, restricted cash, receivables, accounts payable and other payables approximated their carrying values because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. If these instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, they would be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair
values for other investments held at cost are not readily available, but we estimate that the carrying values for these investments approximate their fair values.

Long-term debt is presented at carrying value on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. If our long-term debt were recorded at fair value, it would be
classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Long-term debt balances were as follows ($ in millions):

5.   Derivative Instruments

Table of Contents

We manage our economic and transaction exposure to certain risks by using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar
exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in our Canadian operations and by using interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate
fluctuations on our $500 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028. In addition, we use foreign currency forward contracts not designated as
hedging instruments to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized receivable and payable balances
denominated in non-functional currencies.

Our derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges and interest rate swaps are recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair
value. When material, the gross fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments and corresponding fair value classifications are included in Note 4, Fair
Value Measurements.

Short-Term Debt

U.S. Revolving Credit Facility

On April 12, 2023, we entered into a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the “Five-Year Facility Agreement”) with a
syndicate of banks. The Five-Year Facility Agreement replaced the previous $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Previous Facility”) with a
syndicate of banks, which was entered into in May 2021 and scheduled to expire in May 2026, but was terminated on April 12, 2023. The Five-Year Facility
Agreement permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in April 2028. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Five-Year Facility Agreement as
of July 29, 2023, or the Previous Facility as of January 28, 2023, or July 30, 2022.

We generate substantially all of our revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of products and services. Contract balances primarily consist of
receivables and liabilities related to unfulfilled membership benefits and services not yet completed, product merchandise not yet delivered to customers,
deferred revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and unredeemed gift cards. Contract balances were as follows ($ in millions):

8.   Earnings per Share

We compute our basic earnings per share based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and our diluted earnings per share based on
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had potentially
dilutive common shares been issued.

Reconciliations of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows ($ and shares in millions, except per share

2023, and August 30, 2023, we repurchased an incremental 0.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $25 million. We currently expect to continue
share repurchases throughout fiscal 2024, with the level of repurchases being slightly higher in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.

10.   Contingencies

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. Where appropriate, we have made accruals with respect to these matters, which are reflected on our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there are cases where liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and,
therefore, accruals have not been made. We provide disclosure of matters where we believe it is reasonably possible the impact may be material to our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms “Best Buy,” “we,” “us” and “our” refers to Best Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Any
references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements
with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our
future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are
discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023
(including the information presented therein under Risk Factors), as well as our other reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K and other publicly available information. All
amounts herein are unaudited.

Overview

We are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We
accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit
our stores or invite us into their homes.

We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the
U.S. and our Best Buy Health business. The International segment is comprised of all our operations in Canada.

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and
earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.

Comparable Sales

Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores,
websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales
includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and
represents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or
take delivery direct to their homes. Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of
the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers
and dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or
stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. Comparable sales excludes the impact of
revenue from discontinued operations, the impact of profit-share revenue from our services plan portfolio and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only). All periods presented apply this methodology consistently.

We believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores,
websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies
across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.

14

Table of Contents

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), as well as certain adjusted
or non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per
share (“EPS”). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide additional useful information
for evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts
and financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include
adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on sales of
subsidiaries and certain investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other
items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. We provide
reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures that enable investors
to understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and to evaluate performance using the same metrics as management.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly
encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for
comparative purposes.

In our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency
exchange rates we use to convert the International segment’s operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use
the term “constant currency,” which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impacts as the difference between the
current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We believe
the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.

Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax
rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the presented periods.

Business Strategy Update

In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, our teams once again delivered strong execution and showcased their ability to navigate through what continues to be a
challenging environment for our industry, while keeping our customers and their experiences as our top priority. We continue to appropriately balance the need to
adjust in response to current industry sales trends with the need to invest so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and
returns to expected growth.

Our digital sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and nearly twice
as high as the percentage of Domestic revenue in the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020. During these same time periods, the percentage of online
sales picked up in our stores by our customers was also consistent at just over 40%. Therefore, we are continuing to adapt our omni-channel capabilities to
ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape.

We believe our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to
become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver our fiscal 2024 store plans, which include
closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 large format Experience store remodels and expanding the number of Outlet stores to approximately 25 by
the end of fiscal 2024.

We continue to advance our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our industry and marketplace trends with two overarching goals in mind –
efficiently allocating our labor cost, considering the channel shift from our physical stores to online, and providing our employees flexibility, predictability and
opportunities to gain more skills. We are focused on balancing the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our customers and
other stakeholders. At the same time, we have been investing in tools, training and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and
across stores. As not all roles, and the associated hourly pay, are the same, we are making the strategic tradeoff decisions necessary to give us the ability to
flexibly adjust our labor spending appropriately, particularly customer-facing labor.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we continued to build customer relationships through our membership programs. We successfully launched significant
changes to our membership program that we expect will give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget and
shopping preferences. In addition, we expect the changes to provide more flexibility to evolve our programs in the future, while resulting in a lower cost to serve
than our previous paid membership program, which we have already seen in margin favorability.

15

For the remainder of fiscal 2024, macroeconomic headwinds will likely result in continued pressure, and we are preparing for sales in the consumer electronics
industry to decline again this year. In particular, our customers are facing economic challenges from the dual pressures of high inflation and the resulting interest
rate increases, and it is difficult to predict how such factors will impact us in the near term. However, we expect several factors to drive the eventual return of
industry growth over time, including the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the technology bought earlier in the pandemic and continued vendor
innovation. In addition, macro technology trends like cloud, augmented reality, generative AI and expanded broadband access have the potential to drive new
products and demand. While our product categories tend to experience slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the
coming years. In addition, we are continuing our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and
electric car charging.

We remain excited about our industry and our future. There are more technology products than ever in people’s homes, technology is increasingly a necessity in
our lives, and we believe we are uniquely there for our customers as they continue to navigate this innovative space.

Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers’
corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023.

In the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, we generated $9.6 billion and $19.1 billion in revenue, respectively, and our comparable sales declined
6.2% and 8.2%, respectively, as we continued to operate in a consumer electronics industry that is challenged from the pull-forward of demand in prior years,
increased spending outside the home in areas such as travel and entertainment, and various macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation and rising
interest rates.

Revenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate changes in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by our
Domestic segment. For further discussion of our Domestic and International segments, see Segment Performance Summary, below.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Our effective tax rate
(“ETR”) increased to 26.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 15.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the prior year resolution
of certain discrete tax matters.

Income tax expense was relatively unchanged in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters offset
by a decrease in pre-tax earnings. Our ETR increased to 24.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2024 compared to 20.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2023,
primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact
of lower pre-tax earnings.

Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual ETR, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the
relevant period. We update our estimate of the annual ETR each quarter and we make a cumulative adjustment if our estimated tax rate changes. Our quarterly
tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual ETR are subject to variation due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast our pre-tax
and taxable income and loss by jurisdiction, tax audit developments, recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation,
foreign currency gains (losses), changes in laws or regulations, and expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our ETR can be more or less
volatile based on the amount of pre-tax earnings. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible losses on our ETR is greater when our pre-tax
earnings are lower.

The decrease in revenue in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines in appliances, home theater,
computing and mobile phones, partially offset by comparable sales growth in gaming. Online revenue of $2.8 billion and $5.5 billion in the second quarter and
first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased 7.1% and 9.7% on a comparable basis, respectively. These decreases in revenue were primarily due to the reasons
described above and within the Consolidated Results section, above.

We continuously monitor store performance as part of a market-driven, omnichannel strategy. As we approach the expiration of leases, we evaluate various
options for each location, including whether a store should remain open. We currently expect to close a total of 20 to 30 Best Buy stores and open approximately
5 Outlet Centers in fiscal 2024.

Notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:

·
·

·
·

·

Computing and Mobile Phones: The 6.4% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones and tablets.
Consumer Electronics: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater, partially offset by comparable sales growth in
headphones and portable speakers.
Appliances: The 16.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.
Entertainment: The 9.0% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by gaming, partially offset by comparable sales declines in virtual reality and
drones.
Services: The 7.6% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by the cumulative growth in our paid membership base.

Our gross profit rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to favorable product margin rates, improved financial performance from our
membership offerings, which included higher services margin rates and reduced costs associated with program changes made to our free membership offering,
and an improved gross profit rate from our Health initiatives.

Our gross profit rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to improved financial performance from our membership offerings, which
included higher services margin rates and reduced costs associated with program changes made to our free membership offering, favorable product margin
rates, the profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an improved gross profit rate from our Health initiatives.

Our profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement has been a consistent benefit to our gross profit and operating income rates for the past nine
quarters and approximated 1.4% of Domestic revenue in fiscal 2023, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. This growth has
been driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this
profit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is
expected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.

Our SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll
expense.

Our SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense.

The reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention
from our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.

Our operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset
by an unfavorable SG&A rate.

Our operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and
higher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.

category. The increase in our gross profit rate in the first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by improved product margin rates.

Our SG&A decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and lower

For additional information regarding the nature of charges discussed below, refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, Note 2, Restructuring, and Note 3, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

(1) Represents the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology assets.
(2) Represents charges related to employee termination benefits and subsequent adjustments from higher-than-expected employee retention related to previously planned organizational changes.
(3) Represents the gain on sale of a Mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in Mexico.
(4)

The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S. and Mexico. As such, the forecasted annual income tax charge on the U.S. non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the statutory tax rate of
24.5%. There is no forecasted annual income tax benefit for Mexico non-GAAP items, as there is no forecasted annual tax expense on the income in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.

Our non-GAAP operating income rates decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to unfavorable SG&A rates, partially
offset by favorable gross profit rates.

Our non-GAAP effective tax rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Our non-
GAAP effective tax rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax
benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.

Our non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the decreases in non-GAAP operating income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support
our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital
management. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share
repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other
changes in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.

Cash and cash equivalents were as follows ($ in millions):

The increase in cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by the timing and volume of inventory purchases
and payments, and lower incentive compensation payments in the current year as a result of less favorable fiscal 2023 results. These impacts were partially
offset by higher tax payments in the current year, a decrease in deferred revenue and lower earnings in the current-year period.

Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased, primarily driven by lower capital spending for initiatives to support our business
and a decrease in purchases of investments. We currently expect capital expenditures to approximate $850 million in fiscal 2024.

Financing Activities

The decrease in cash used in financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower share repurchases.

Sources of Liquidity

Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of
liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic
initiatives, including business combinations. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. There can be no
assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit
facilities or obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.

On April 12, 2023, we entered into a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the “Five-Year Facility Agreement”) with a
syndicate of banks. The Five-Year Facility Agreement replaced the previous $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Previous Facility”) with a
syndicate of banks, which was entered into in May 2021 and scheduled to expire in May 2026, but was terminated on April 12, 2023. The Five-Year Facility
Agreement permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in April 2028. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Five-Year Facility Agreement as
of July 29, 2023, or the Previous Facility as of January 28, 2023, or July 30, 2022.

Our credit ratings and outlook as of August 30, 2023, remained unchanged from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 28, 2023, and are summarized below.

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.
Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer
electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other
things, interest costs for certain of our credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store leasing
costs.

Table of Contents

Restricted Cash

Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to cover product protection plans provided under our membership offerings
and other self-insurance liabilities. Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $398 million,
$379 million and $312 million at July 29, 2023, January 28, 2023, and July 30, 2022, respectively. The increases in restricted cash from January 28, 2023, and
July 30, 2022, were primarily due to growth in our paid membership base.

Debt and Capital

As of July 29, 2023, we had $500 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028, and $650 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2030.
Refer to Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Note 8, Debt, of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, for additional information
about our outstanding debt.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

We repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board of Directors (“Board”). The payment of cash dividends is also
subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then
return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. Our share repurchase
plans are evaluated on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as our financial condition and cash flows, our economic outlook, the impact of tax laws, our
liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on such factors.

On February 28, 2022, our Board approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase program, which replaced the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized on
February 16, 2021. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.

The total cost of shares repurchased increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in the volume of repurchases. The total cost of
shares repurchased decreased in the first six months of fiscal 2024 due to decreases in the volume of repurchases and the average price per share. Cash
dividends declared and paid increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend
per share, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.

Between the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 on July 29, 2023, and August 30, 2023, we repurchased an incremental 0.3 million shares of our common
stock at a cost of $25 million. We currently expect to continue share repurchases throughout fiscal 2024, with the level of repurchases being slightly higher in the
second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.

Other Financial Measures

Our current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, remained unchanged at 1.0 as of July 29, 2023, January 28, 2023, and July 30, 2022.

Our debt to earnings ratio, calculated as total debt (including current portion) divided by net earnings over the trailing twelve months increased to 0.9 as of July
29, 2023, compared to 0.8 as of January 28, 2023, and 0.7 as of July 30, 2022, primarily due to lower net earnings.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off-balance-sheet financing arrangements other than in connection with our $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our
Five-Year Facility Agreement as of July 29, 2023, which, if drawn upon, would be included in either short-term or long-term debt on our Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Table of Contents

There has been no material change in our contractual obligations other than in the ordinary course of business since the end of fiscal 2023. See our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, for additional information regarding our off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual
obligations.

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates

We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and
our critical accounting estimates in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023. There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting
estimates since the end of fiscal 2023.

New Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of applicable new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our
financial statements.

Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act

Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”),
provide a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies. With the exception of
historical information, the matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements and may be identified by the use of words
such as “anticipate,” “appear,” “approximate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “foresee,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “might,”
“outlook,” “plan,” “possible,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “would,” and other words and terms of similar meaning or the negatives thereof. Such statements reflect
our current views and estimates with respect to future market conditions, company performance and financial results, operational investments, business
prospects, our operating model, new strategies and growth initiatives, the competitive environment, consumer behavior and other events. These statements
involve a number of judgments and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, that could cause actual
results to differ materially from the potential results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Readers should review Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any updated information in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, for a description of important factors that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Among the
factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements are the following:
macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate (including but not limited to recession, inflation rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates, limitations on a government’s ability to borrow and/or spend capital, fluctuations in housing prices, energy markets, and jobless rates and effects related to
the conflict in Ukraine or other geopolitical events); catastrophic events, health crises and pandemics; susceptibility of the products we sell to technological
advancements, product life cycle fluctuations and; changes in consumer preferences; competition (including from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce business,
technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers and in the provision of delivery speed and options); our ability
to attract and retain qualified employees; changes in market compensation rates; our expansion into health and new products, services and technologies; our
focus on services as a strategic priority; our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers (including product availability); our ability to maintain positive
brand perception and recognition; our ability to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions; our ability to effectively manage our real estate
portfolio; inability of vendors or service providers to perform components of our supply chain (impacting our stores or other aspects of our operations) and other
various functions of our business; risks arising from and potentially unique to our exclusive brands products; our reliance on our information technology systems,
internet and telecommunications access and capabilities; our ability to prevent or effectively respond to a cyber-attack, privacy or security breach; product safety
and quality concerns; changes to labor or employment laws or regulations; risks arising from statutory, regulatory and legal developments (including statutes
and/or regulations related to tax or privacy); evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations (including, but not limited to,
cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance matters) risks arising from our international activities (including those related to the conflict in Ukraine or
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates) and those of our vendors; failure to effectively manage our costs; our dependence on cash flows and net
earnings generated during the fourth fiscal quarter; pricing investments and promotional activity; economic or regulatory developments that might affect our ability
to provide attractive promotional financing; constraints in the capital markets; changes to our vendor credit terms; changes in our credit ratings; failure to meet
financial-performance guidance or other forward-looking statements; and general economic uncertainty in key global markets and worsening of global economic
conditions or low levels of economic growth. We caution that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete. Any forward-looking statements speak only as
of the date they are made and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement that we may make.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, in addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to
certain market risks.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to changes in short-term market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense. Our cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash generate interest income that will vary based on changes in short-term interest rates. In addition, we have swapped a portion of our fixed-rate
debt to floating rate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with short-term interest rates. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, for further
information regarding our interest rate swaps.

As of July 29, 2023, we had $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $0.5 billion of debt that has been swapped to floating rate, and
therefore the net asset balance exposed to interest rate changes was $1.0 billion. As of July 29, 2023, a 50-basis point increase in short-term interest rates would
have led to an estimated $5 million increase in interest income, and conversely a 50-basis point decrease in short-term interest rates would have led to an
estimated $5 million decrease in interest income.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to operations in our International segment. On a limited basis, we utilize
foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases, recognized receivable and payable balances
and our investment in our Canadian operations. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, for additional information regarding these instruments.

In the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar
compared to the Canadian dollar compared to the prior-year period, which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as this foreign currency revenue
translated into less U.S. dollars. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately $26
million and $72 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our net earnings
in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was not significant.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”)
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive
officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have established a Disclosure
Committee, consisting of certain members of management, to assist in this evaluation. The Disclosure Committee meets on a regular quarterly basis and more
often if necessary.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), at July 29, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at July 29, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended July 29, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
