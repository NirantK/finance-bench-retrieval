Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements of Netflix, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) have been prepared in

conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.”) and are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January
26, 2023. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant
items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the amortization of content assets and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and
liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates the assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly
present the information set forth herein. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of the results for a full year.

There have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the

Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

2. Revenue Recognition

The Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership

and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and
remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (“CE”)
manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), mobile operators and internet service providers (“ISPs”), provide access to the
service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed.
However, if there is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the member pays is established by the
partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.

The Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products and various other sources. Revenues earned

from sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.

The following tables summarize revenues, paid net membership additions (losses), and ending paid memberships by region for the three and six months

ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively:

(1) A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of
payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have
the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in
the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary
cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of
sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.

Total U.S. revenues, inclusive of DVD revenues not reported in the tables above, were $3.3 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2023 and $3.3 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. DVD revenues were $29 million
and $60 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and $37 million and $77 million, respectively, for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2022.

Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift cards and other prepaid memberships that have not
been fully redeemed. As of June 30, 2023, total deferred revenue was $1,312 million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are
expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid
memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $47 million
increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $1,265 million as of December 31, 2022 is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to
increased memberships.

3. Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per

share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential outstanding shares of common
stock during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation
of earnings per share is as follows:

Basic earnings per share:

Net income
Shares used in computation:
Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding

4. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Short-term Investments

The Company’s investment policy is consistent with the definition of available-for-sale securities. The Company does not buy and hold securities
principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. The Company’s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and return. From time to
time, the Company may sell certain securities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price. The following tables
summarize the Company's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

(1) The majority of the Company's time deposits are domestic deposits, which mature within one year.

Other current assets include restricted cash for deposits related to self insurance and letter of credit agreements. Non-current assets include restricted cash

related to letter of credit agreements. The fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments included in the Level 2 category is based on observable
inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either
directly or indirectly.

See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company’s senior notes.

There were no material gross realized gains or losses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

6. Debt

As of June 30, 2023, the Company had aggregate outstanding notes of $14,470 million, net of $72 million of issuance costs, with varying maturities (the

"Notes"). Of the outstanding balance, $399 million, net of issuance costs, is classified as short-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
December 31, 2022, the Company had aggregate outstanding notes of $14,353 million, net of $79 million of issuance costs. Each of the Notes were issued at
par and are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. Interest is payable semi-annually at fixed rates. A portion of the outstanding Notes is denominated in
foreign currency (comprised of €5,170 million) and is remeasured into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date (with remeasurement loss totaling $29 million
and $110 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023).

Table of Contents

Each of the Notes are repayable in whole or in part upon the occurrence of a change of control, at the option of the holders, at a purchase price in cash

equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued interest. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at an amount equal to the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable premium. The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the
Company's ability to create, incur or allow certain liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness
of certain of the Company's subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company's and its subsidiaries
assets, to another person. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.

Revolving Credit Facility

On March 6, 2023, the Company amended its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Agreement") to replace the London
interbank offered rate to a variable secured overnight financing rate (the “Term SOFR Rate”) as the rate to which interest payments are indexed, among other
things. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on June 17, 2026. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 17, 2026, at which
time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working
capital and general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2023, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the

“Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to the Term SOFR Rate (or the applicable benchmark replacement), plus a margin of 0.75%. The Alternate Base Rate
is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate,
plus 0.500% and (C) the Term SOFR Rate for a one-month tenor, plus 1.00%. The Term SOFR Rate is the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate
administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or a successor administrator, for the relevant interest period, but in no event shall the Term SOFR Rate
be less than 0.00% per annum.

The Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of 0.10%. The
Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s
subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in
the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all related
covenants.

7. Commitments and Contingencies

Content

As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $20.9 billion of obligations comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.8 billion of
"Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $13.7 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $21.8 billion of obligations comprised of $4.5 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.1
billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.

The expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:

Less than one year
Due after one year and through three years
Due after three years and through five years
Due after five years
Total content obligations

Table of Contents

Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are

translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and
employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the
Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of
the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of
such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the
unknown obligations are expected to be significant.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee

relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of
complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto
unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the
Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

The Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at

this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.

Indemnification

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of
varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s
breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on
the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.

The Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse

against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that
will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The
terms of such obligations vary.

It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the
conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.

8. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Option Plan

In June 2020, the Company's stockholders approved the 2020 Stock Plan, which was adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors in March 2020
subject to stockholder approval. The 2020 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on
the last trading day of the second quarter of 2023 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by
the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of the second quarter of 2023. This amount changes based on the fair
market value of the Company’s common stock.

In March 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of its common stock, with no expiration date. Stock
repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading
plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or
other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of
shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s stock price, general economic,
business and market conditions, and alternative investment

The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 differed from the Federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of

international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, research and development credits, and the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based
compensation. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 differed from the Federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of
foreign taxes, international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, research and development credits, and the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based
compensation.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was consistent compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate
for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in foreign taxes. For the three and six months
ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit related to the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $28 million and
$52 million, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 of $18 million and $43 million.

Gross unrecognized tax benefits were $240 million and $227 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The gross unrecognized

tax benefits, if recognized by the Company, will result in a reduction of approximately $164 million to the provision for income taxes thereby favorably
impacting the Company’s effective tax rate.

The Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016 through 2018
and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2022. The foreign and state tax returns for the years 2015 through 2022 are subject to examination by various
states and foreign jurisdictions. While the Company is in various stages of inquiries and examinations by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, we
believe that our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained. Nonetheless, it is possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise.

Given the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of

limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an
estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.

10. Segment and Geographic Information

The Company operates as one operating segment. The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is its co-chief executive officers, who

Overview

We are one of the world’s leading entertainment services with over 238 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and

games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can
change their plans at any time.

Our core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members’

experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance
member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.

Our membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to
increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be
impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing.

(1) In April 2023, we announced our plans to discontinue our DVD-by-mail service, which we do not expect to have a material effect on our operations or financial results.

Consolidated revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2023 increased 3% as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in our

consolidated revenues was due to the 6% growth in average paying memberships, partially offset by a 3% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying
membership. The decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain
foreign currencies, higher membership growth in regions with lower average monthly revenue per paying membership and timing of paid net membership
additions. These decreases were partially offset by price increases in certain regions.

The increase in operating margin is primarily due to the 3% growth in revenue coupled with lower cost of revenues, technology and development
expenses, and general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The decrease
in expenses was impacted by approximately $150 million of expenses related to cost restructuring initiatives incurred during the three months ended June 30,
2022 with no similar transactions for the three months ended June 30, 2023.

Streaming Revenues

We primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming

membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of June 30, 2023, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar
equivalent of $1 to $27 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $8 per month. We expect that
from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.

We also earn revenue from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products and various other sources. Revenues earned from

sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.

The following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the three and six months ended June 30,

(1) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of
foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained
constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, our revenues would
have been approximately $231 million and $577 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the three and six months ended June 30,
2022.

Cost of Revenues

Amortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content

(such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous
production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We
have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet.
Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud
computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including
those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.

Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our Notes of $175 million and $349 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. Interest

expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 remained relatively flat. The decrease in interest
expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 was due to the lower average aggregate principal of
interest bearing notes outstanding.

Interest and Other Income (Expense)

Interest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned

on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Interest and other income (expense) decreased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $23 million
and $130 million, respectively, compared to gains of $239 million and $431 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2022. In the three months
ended June 30, 2023, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the non-cash losses of $29 million from the remeasurement of our €5,170 million
Senior Notes, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. In the six months
ended June 30, 2023, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the non-cash losses of $110 million from the remeasurement of our €5,170 million
Senior Notes, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. In the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022, the foreign exchange gains were primarily driven by the non-cash gains of $305 million and $466 million, respectively, from the
remeasurement of our €5,170 million Senior Notes, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the
functional currencies. The change in foreign currency gains and losses was partially offset by higher interest income earned in the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2022.

The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 differed from the Federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of

international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, research and development credits, and the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based
compensation.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was consistent compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate

for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in foreign taxes.

(in thousands, except percentages)

Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments increased $2,499 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to cash

provided by operations, partially offset by the repurchase of stock.

Debt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $116 million primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes. The amount of principal and

interest on our outstanding notes due in the next twelve months is $1,086 million. As of June 30, 2023, no amounts had been borrowed under the $1 billion
Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.

We anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional

financing that we may choose or need, including for potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development
efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such
financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.

In March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases
may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended
to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar
purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing
and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and
alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. During the six months ended
June 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 3,071,380 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $1,045 million. As of June 30, 2023, $3.4 billion
remains available for repurchases.

Table of Contents

Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related

costs, as well as for strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization
period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example,
production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to
significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations,
available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve
months and beyond.

Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of June 30,

2023, the expected timing of those payments are as follows:

As of June 30, 2023, content obligations were comprised of $4.4 billion included in “Current content liabilities” and $2.8 billion of “Non-current content
liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $13.7 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not
then meet the criteria for recognition.

The material cash requirements above do not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less
than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately
$1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months.
The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive
and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.

(3)

Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further
details.

Operating lease obligations are comprised of operating lease liabilities included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current
liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, inclusive of imputed interest. Operating lease obligations also include additional obligations that are not
reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not meet the criteria for recognition. See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the
accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases.

As of June 30, 2023, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $240 million. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to

the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.

Free Cash Flow

We define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We
believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt
obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP
financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, or
any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.

In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are

excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt,
and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes
and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1,337 million to $1,440 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net cash

provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in payments for content assets, coupled with a $217 million or 3% increase in revenues.
The payments for content assets decreased $859 million, from $4,496 million to $3,637 million, or 19%. On May 1, 2023, the collective bargaining agreement
between the Writers Guild of America (“WGA”) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (“AMPTP”) expired, and on May 2, 2023, the
WGA commenced an industry-wide strike. On July 12, 2023, the collective bargaining agreement between the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists (“SAG-AFTRA”) and the AMPTP expired, and on July 14, 2023, the SAG-AFTRA commenced an industry-wide strike. We have
paused and expect to pause additional productions in response to the concurrent WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. As a result, the timing of certain production
payments will be delayed until productions can resume and may increase the variability in payments for content assets in future periods.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased $257 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to proceeds from
maturities of short-term investments and there being no acquisitions in the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to acquisitions for an aggregate
amount of $69 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $661 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the repurchases of
common stock for an aggregate amount of $645 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to no repurchases of common stock in the three
months ended June 30, 2022.

Free cash flow was $148 million lower than net income for the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to $227 million of cash payments for

content assets exceeding amortization expense and $28 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $78 million of non-cash
stock-based compensation expense and $29 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt.

Free cash flow was $1,428 million lower than net income for the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to $1,234 million of cash payments for

content assets exceeding amortization expense, $305 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $39 million in other non-
favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $150 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $2,593 million to $3,619 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net cash
provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in payments for content assets, coupled with a $511 million or 3% increase in revenues.
The payments for content assets decreased $1,977 million, from $8,427 million to $6,450 million, or 23%.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $239 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to proceeds from the maturities of
short-term investments and there being no acquisitions in the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to acquisitions for an aggregate amount of $193
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments.

Net cash used in financing activities increased $348 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to repurchases of common stock for an

aggregate amount of $1,045 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to no repurchases of common stock in the six months ended June 30,
2022, partially offset by there being no repayment of debt in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the repayment upon maturity of the
$700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% Senior Notes in February 2022.

Free cash flow was $663 million higher than net income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to $420 million of amortization expense

exceeding cash payments for content assets, $177 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $110 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on
our euro-denominated debt, partially offset by $44 million in other non-favorable working capital differences.

Free cash flow was $2,224 million lower than net income for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to $1,999 million of cash payments for

content assets exceeding amortization expense, $466 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $29 million in other non-

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that
affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to consolidated Financial Statements
in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2022, describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2022.

Item 3.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates, reference is made to Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”

contained in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our exposure to market risk has not changed significantly
since December 31, 2022.

Interest Rate Risk

At June 30, 2023, our cash equivalents and short-term investments were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on

such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.

As of June 30, 2023, we had $14.5 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2024 and 2030. Refer to Note

6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates,
increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on
changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.

Foreign Currency Risk

Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar account for 57% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2023. We therefore have foreign

currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican Peso, the
Japanese yen, and the Australian dollar.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue

and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, our revenues would have been approximately $577 million higher
had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those in the same period of 2022.

We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the
remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we
recognized a $130 million foreign exchange loss primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the
remeasurement of cash and content liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies.

In addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow

for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was an increase of $66 million.

We do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many
factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and, as a
result, such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.

Item 4.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-
Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or

our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that have materially affected,

or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Netflix, Inc.;

2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this

financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4. The registrant’s other certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-
15(f)) for the registrant and have:

a)

designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

b) designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our

supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

d) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent
fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and

5. The registrant’s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the

registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):

a)

b)

all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal
control over financial reporting.
