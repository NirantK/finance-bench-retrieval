Firmwide overview
For the first quarter of 2023, JPMorgan Chase reported net
income of $12.6 billion, up 52%, earnings per share of
$4.10, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 23%.

• Total net revenue was $38.3 billion, up 25%, reflecting:

– Net interest income of $20.7 billion, up 49%, driven by

higher rates, partially offset by lower Markets net
interest income and lower average deposit balances.
Net interest income excluding Markets was $20.9
billion, up 78%.

– Noninterest revenue was $17.6 billion, up 5%, driven
by higher principal transactions revenue in Markets,
predominantly offset by higher net investment

5

securities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower Investment
Banking fees, lower auto operating lease income and
lower production revenue in Home Lending.

– Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower
Markets NII, predominantly offset by higher NIR.

• Noninterest expense was $20.1 billion, up 5%, driven by
higher structural expense and continued investments in
the business, primarily compensation expense reflecting
headcount growth and wage inflation, as well as the
impact of the increase in the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") assessment that was announced in
2022, partially offset by lower auto lease depreciation.

• The provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion,

reflecting a net addition of $1.1 billion to the allowance
for credit losses and $1.1 billion of net charge-offs. The
net addition to the allowance for credit losses was
predominantly driven by a deterioration in the Firm's
weighted-average economic outlook, including the impact
from changes to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios and
increased probability of a moderate recession due to
tightening financial conditions, and consisted of:

– $726 million in wholesale, which also reflected net
downgrade activity, and $416 million in consumer.

Net charge-offs were up $555 million predominantly
driven by CCB, reflecting continued normalization in
delinquencies.

The prior year included a $902 million net addition to the
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $582
million.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $22.8 billion at

March 31, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.85%,
compared with 1.69% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.4 billion at

March 31, 2023, a net decrease of $1.2 billion,
predominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual
loans, reflecting paydowns and loan sales, and lower
nonperforming derivative receivables.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%,

driven by higher loans in CB, CCB and CIB, partially offset
by lower loans in AWM.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.3 trillion were down

8%, predominantly driven by:
– declines in CIB and CB due to attrition and in AWM due to
migration into higher-yielding investments as a result of
the rising interest rate environment, partially offset by
net issuances of structured notes in CIB,

– a decline in CCB from existing accounts primarily due to
migration to higher-yielding investments and increased
customer spending, and

– an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's ongoing

international consumer initiatives.

Period-end deposits were up reflecting inflows in March
2023 as a result of disruptions in the market related to
recent bank failures.

Selected capital and other metrics
• CET1 capital was $227 billion, and the Standardized and

Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.8% and 13.9%,
respectively.

• SLR was 5.9%.

• TBVPS grew 10%, ending the first quarter of 2023 at

$76.69.

• As of March 31, 2023, the Firm had average eligible High
Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $732
billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a
fair value of approximately $700 billion, resulting in
approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-47 for additional
information.

Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 10-12 and
pages 13-14, respectively, for a further discussion of the
Firm's results.

Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR
excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed
basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a further
discussion of each of these measures.

Recent events
• On May 1, 2023, the Firm acquired the substantial

majority of assets and assumed the deposits and certain
other liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC (the
“Acquisition”). The Firm believes that the Acquisition will
be accretive to earnings, will help to further advance the
Firm’s wealth management strategy, and is expected to
be complementary to the Firm’s existing franchises.

The FDIC will provide loss sharing agreements with
respect to the following loans acquired in the Acquisition:
80% of losses on single-family residential mortgage
loans will be covered for seven years, and 80% of losses
on commercial loans will be covered for five years.

The Firm is estimating the impact that the Acquisition will
have on its financial statements, and expects to record an
estimated $2.6 billion post-tax bargain purchase gain in
connection with the Acquisition. The Firm also expects to
recognize restructuring costs of approximately $2.0
billion over the course of 2023 and 2024. The Firm
expects that these estimates will be further refined over
the purchase accounting measurement period.

The Firm will repay the $25 billion of deposits placed by
large U.S. banks with First Republic Bank on March 16,
2023. The Firm will eliminate its $5 billion deposit in
consolidation and release the associated allowance for
credit losses.

The financial information and other disclosures contained
in this Form 10-Q do not give effect to the Acquisition.
Refer to Note 26 for additional information concerning
the Acquisition.

• On March 24, 2023, JPMorgan Chase obtained final

approval from China’s State Administration for Market
Regulation to complete its acquisition of China
International Fund Management Co., Ltd. ("CIFM").

• On March 22, 2023, JPMorgan Chase announced that it

had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
Aumni, a provider of investment analytics software.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q,
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to
Forward-Looking Statements on page 78, and page 154 and
Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K for
a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties
and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s
actual results to differ materially because of those risks and
uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in
2023 will be in line with the outlook information set forth
below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023 should
be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S.
economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical
environment, the competitive environment, client and
customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative
developments in the U.S. and other countries where the
Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the
performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make
appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in
response to ongoing developments in the business,
economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it
operates.

The Firm expects to be subject to a special assessment by
the FDIC as a result of the estimated losses incurred by the
Deposit Insurance Fund from recent bank failures. The FDIC
has expressed its intent to issue a notice of proposed
rulemaking related to the special assessment in May 2023.

The full-year 2023 outlook does not include the effects of
the First Republic Bank acquisition.

Full-year 2023
• Management expects both net interest income and net
interest income excluding Markets to be approximately
$81 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be

approximately $81 billion, market dependent and
excluding any FDIC special assessment.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card

Services to be approximately 2.6%.

Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17.

Business Developments
Current market and economic conditions
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A,
Risk Factors on page 177 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion
of material risk factors that could affect the Firm. These risk
factors include potential impacts to the Firm associated
with current market and economic conditions, including
inflationary pressures, rapidly rising interest rates, the
failure of market participants and geopolitical tensions
(including secondary effects of the war in Ukraine), any or
all of which could result in additional market disruption,
government actions (including with respect to monetary
policies), ongoing impacts to global supply chains, and
other geopolitical risks.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
The Firm and other market participants are preparing for
the final stages of the transition from the use of the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs in
accordance with the International Organization of Securities
Commission’s standards for transaction-based benchmark
rates. The cessation of the publication of the remaining
principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-
month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR)
(“LIBOR Cessation”) is scheduled for June 30, 2023. On
April 3, 2023, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
announced that the one-month, three-month and six-month
tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be published on
a "synthetic" basis, which will allow market participants to
use such rates for certain legacy LIBOR-linked contracts
through September 30, 2024.
On March 1, 2023, the Firm announced that, after June 30,
2023, CME Term SOFR will be the replacement reference
rate for certain outstanding floating rate and fixed-to-
floating rate debt securities, preferred stock and certificates
of deposit issued by JPMorgan Chase and certain of its
subsidiaries that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate
and that are governed by New York or Delaware law. The
Firm is prepared to participate in initiatives by the principal
central counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared
derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the
second quarter of 2023. The Firm continues its client
outreach with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked products
and continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry,
market, regulatory and legislative developments. Refer to
Business Developments on page 50 of JPMorgan Chase's
2022 Form 10-K for additional information.

the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Also
includes losses on tax-oriented investments. Refer to Note 5 for
additional information.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting lower
debt underwriting fees as challenging market conditions
resulted in lower issuance activity. Refer to CIB segment
results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional
information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting:

• higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by

Rates benefiting from favorable market conditions early
in the quarter and elevated volatility in March 2023, as
well as in Securitized Products and Fixed Income
Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in Currencies
& Emerging Markets compared to a strong prior year,

• in Equity Markets, higher revenue in principal

transactions, particularly in Prime Finance and Equity
Derivatives, which was more than offset by losses in net
interest income,

• a loss of $153 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in
CIB, compared with a loss of $524 million in the prior
year, and

• net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in
Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets
across other revenue lines, including net interest income.
The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets
business on a total net revenue basis.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27
and pages 33-34, respectively, and Note 5 for additional
information.

10

Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased due to lower
cash management fees in CB and CIB associated with the
higher level of credits earned by clients that reduce such
fees. Refer to CIB and CB segment results on pages 23-27,
pages 28-29 and Note 5 for additional information.

Asset management fees decreased driven by lower average
market levels and lower performance fees, partially offset
by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in
AWM, and to a lesser extent, the impact of lower market
levels in CCB. Refer to AWM segment results on pages
30-32 and Note 5 for additional information.

Commissions and other fees: refer to CIB and AWM
segment results on pages 23-27 and pages 30-32 and Note
5 for additional information.

Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on
sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S.
Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment
securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate
segment results on pages 33-34 and Note 9 for additional
information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by
Home Lending, reflecting lower production revenue from a
decline in volume, and lower net mortgage servicing
revenue due to a net loss compared with a net gain in the
prior year in MSR risk management. Refer to CCB segment
results on pages 20-22 and Notes 5 and 14 for additional
information.

Card income increased driven by:

• higher net interchange income largely due to a reduction

in rewards costs and partner payments related to a
periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed, and higher
annual fees, partially offset by higher amortization
related to new account origination costs in CCB, and
• higher payments-related revenue on volume growth in

Commercial Card in CIB.

Refer to CCB and CIB segment results on pages 20-22 and
pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information.

Other income decreased reflecting:

• the absence of a gain on an equity investment in the prior

year in CIB,

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB from a decline

in volume, and

• the absence of proceeds from an insurance settlement in

the prior year,

partially offset by

• a gain of $339 million in AWM on the original minority
interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the
remaining 51% interest in the entity.

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates,
partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and
lower average deposit balances.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2
trillion, down $185 billion, and the yield was 4.68%, up
282 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on
an FTE basis, was 2.63%, an increase of 96 bps. The net
yield excluding Markets was 3.80%, up 185 bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest
and rates schedule on page 167 for further information.
Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial
measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the
Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17
for a further discussion of Net yield excluding Markets.

Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion, reflecting a
net addition of $1.1 billion to the allowance for credit
losses and $1.1 billion of net charge-offs.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses was
predominantly driven by a deterioration in the Firm's
weighted-average economic outlook, including the impact
from changes to the Firm’s macroeconomic scenarios and
increased probability of a moderate recession due to
tightening financial conditions, and consisted of:

• $726 million in wholesale, which also reflected net

downgrade activity, and an addition to the allowance for
credit losses associated with Other assets in Corporate,
and

• $416 million in consumer.

Net charge-offs increased $555 million, predominantly
driven by CCB, reflecting continued normalization in
delinquencies.

The prior year included a $902 million net addition to the
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $582
million.

Quarterly results
Compensation expense increased driven by additional
headcount, primarily in technology and operations, as well
as front office, and the impact of wage inflation, partially
offset by lower revenue-related compensation in CIB.

Noncompensation expense was flat and primarily included:

• higher investments in the business, including marketing

and technology, and

• higher structural expense, including the impact of the

increase in the FDIC assessment that was announced in
2022,

offset by

• lower volume-related expense, reflecting lower

depreciation expense on lower Auto lease assets.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased primarily as a result of Markets activities,
partially offset by the impact of higher deposits. Deposits
with banks reflect the Firm’s placement of its excess cash
with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve
Banks.

Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven activities and higher demand
for securities to cover short positions.

Refer to Note 10 for information on securities purchased
under resale agreements and securities borrowed.

Trading assets increased due to higher levels of debt and
equity instruments in Markets, reflecting strong client-
driven market-making activities, including in the U.S.
Treasury market, and when compared with the seasonally
lower levels at year-end. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for
additional information.

Investment securities decreased primarily due to
maturities and paydowns of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE
and government agency MBS in both available-for-sale
(“AFS”) and held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities. The
decrease in AFS was also due to net sales, partially offset by
the transfer of securities from HTM to AFS.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 66, and
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.

Loans were relatively flat, and included:

• lower wholesale loans in CIB,

• lower balances in Card Services, reflecting the impact of

seasonality, and

• lower securities-based lending in AWM,

predominantly offset by
• higher revolver utilization and originations in CB.
The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net
addition of $914 million to the allowance for loan losses,
predominantly driven by a deterioration in the Firm's
weighted-average economic outlook, including the impact
from changes to the Firm’s macroeconomic scenarios and
increased probability of a moderate recession due to
tightening financial conditions, consisting of:

• $499 million in wholesale, which also reflected net
downgrade activity, and $415 million in consumer.

The allowance for loan losses also reflected a reduction of
$587 million as a result of the adoption of the Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings
accounting guidance. References in this Form 10-Q to
"changes to the TDR accounting guidance" pertain to the
Firm's adoption of this guidance.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
48-66, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for additional
information on loans and the total allowance for credit
losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased
primarily due to lower receivables in Payments related to
the timing of processing payment activities, with December
31, 2022 falling on a weekend.

Premises and equipment: refer to Note 16 for information

Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased due to
lower client payables related to client-driven activities in
Markets, as well as lower payables in Payments related to
the timing of processing payment activities, with December
31, 2022 falling on a weekend.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased
driven by higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller
conduit commercial paper held by third parties. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-47 and Notes 13
and 22 for additional information, specifically Firm-
sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt: refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 42-47 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity: refer to Consolidated statements of
changes in stockholders’ equity on page 82, Capital Actions
on page 40, and Note 19 for additional information.

Deposits increased, reflecting inflows in March 2023,
primarily in CCB and CB, as a result of disruptions in the
market related to recent bank failures, which changed the
outflow trend that started in the second half of 2022. AWM
also experienced deposit inflows in March which were more
than offset by migration to higher-yielding investments by
month end. The increase in period-end deposits also
reflected:

• net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a result of

client demand, and

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's ongoing

international consumer initiatives.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased due to higher
secured financing of trading assets and the impact of a
lower level of netting on client-driven market-making
activities in Markets.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-47 for
additional information on deposits, federal funds purchased
and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements,
and short-term borrowings; and also to Notes 2 and 15 for
deposits and Note 10 for federal funds purchased and
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in
higher levels of short positions in debt instruments,
partially offset by lower derivative payables as a result of
market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional
information.

Financing activities
• In 2023, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned

or sold under repurchase agreements and deposits,
partially offset by net payments on long- and short-term
borrowings.

• In 2022, cash provided reflected higher deposits and

securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements
and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.

• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of
common stock and cash dividends on common and
preferred stock.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on
pages 79-83.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment
level. These non-GAAP measures include:
• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue from investments that receive
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE”
basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue

less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue

excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense

excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained,

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues
and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate
movements related to the transferred risk in its results.
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 67-72 for
additional information.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is
referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions,
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are
reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the
LOBs may change.

Refer to Line of business equity on page 39, and page 93 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business
segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 and Note
32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of those methodologies.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of customer
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The
management reporting process that derives business
segment results includes the allocation of certain income
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and
analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and
services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the
participating business segments may agree to share
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s)
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect
these revenue-sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and
Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk
and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest
rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and
liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest
income to the segments.

20

Quarterly results
Net income was $5.2 billion, up 80%.

Net revenue was $16.5 billion, an increase of 35%.

Net interest income was $12.8 billion, up 54%, driven by:

• deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset

by lower average deposits in Banking & Wealth
Management (“BWM”), and

• higher revolving loans in Card Services,

partially offset by

• tighter loan spreads in Home Lending.

Noninterest revenue was $3.6 billion, down 6%, driven by:

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline

in volume, and

• in Home Lending lower production revenue from a decline

in volume and lower net mortgage servicing revenue,
reflecting a net loss compared with a net gain in the prior
year in MSR risk management,

largely offset by

• an increase in card income driven by higher net

interchange largely due to a reduction in rewards costs
and partner payments related to a periodic tax refund on
airline miles redeemed, and higher annual fees, partially
offset by higher amortization related to new account
origination costs, and

• higher travel-related commissions in Card Services.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card income,
asset management fees, and commissions and other fees.
Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and
mortgage fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $8.1 billion, up 5%, largely driven
by:

• higher compensation expense driven by wage inflation and
headcount growth, as well as investments in the business,

• lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, and included:

• net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, up $499 million,

predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting
continued normalization in delinquencies, and

• a $350 million net addition to the allowance for credit
losses, driven by a deterioration in the Firm’s weighted-
average economic outlook, including $300 million in Card
Services and $50 million in Home Lending.

The prior year included a $125 million addition to the
allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
48-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for a
further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance
for credit losses.

(a) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans
90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of
$164 million and $315 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s
policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on
nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(b) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, generally excludes loans that were under

payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022
Form 10-K for further information on consumer assistance.

(c) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, included $205 million and $2.9 billion of

loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not
expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are
guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the PPP.

(d) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the principal balance of loans under

payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
was $353 million and $728 million in Home Lending, respectively. Loans
that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not
considered delinquent. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on consumer
assistance.

(e) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S.

government agencies of $219 million and $370 million, respectively, that
are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee.

(f) On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting

guidance. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a net decrease in the
allowance for loan losses of $591 million, driven by residential real estate
and credit card. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Quarterly results
Net income was $4.4 billion, up 1%.

Net revenue was $13.6 billion, flat compared to the prior
year.

Banking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 1%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $1.6 billion, down 24%,
predominantly driven by lower Investment Banking fees,
down 19%, reflecting lower debt underwriting fees. The
Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees,
according to Dealogic.

– Debt underwriting fees were $663 million, down 34%,
and Equity underwriting fees were $235 million, down
6%, as challenging market conditions resulted in lower
issuance activity.

– Advisory fees were $756 million, down 6%, compared

to a strong prior year, driven by a lower level of
announced deals.

• Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% and included

a gain on an equity investment in the prior year.
Excluding the net impact of equity investments, Payments
revenue was up 55%, driven by deposit margin
expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower
average deposits.

• Lending revenue was $267 million, down 17%, and

included $103 million of fair value losses on hedges of
retained loans.

(b) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value primarily reflect lending

related positions originated and purchased in CIB Markets, including
loans held for securitization.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $9.4 billion, up
1%. Markets revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4%.

Selected metrics

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.7 billion, flat

compared to the prior year, reflecting:

– lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets

compared to a strong prior year, and

– higher revenue in Rates with favorable market

conditions early in the quarter and elevated volatility in
March 2023, as well as higher revenue in Credit
Trading from higher client flows.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.7 billion, down 12%,

driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives and Cash
Equities, compared to a strong first quarter in the prior
year.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7%,
driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates,
partially offset by lower average deposits and lower
average market values of assets under custody.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $153 million,
driven by losses on certain components of fair value
option elected liabilities, compared with a loss of $524
million in the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $7.5 billion, up 2%, largely driven
by higher compensation, including headcount growth and
wage inflation, largely offset by lower revenue-related
compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $58 million,
predominantly driven by net charge-offs of $50 million. The
net addition to the allowance for credit losses was driven by
net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the Firm's
weighted-average economic outlook, largely offset by a
reduction in the allowance for client-specific exposures.

The prior year provision was $445 million, driven by a net
addition to the allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
48-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm
assesses its Markets business performance on a total
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line
items. For example, securities that generate net interest
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition
of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets
revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information.

For the periods presented below, the primary source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized
upon executing new transactions.

revenue sharing arrangement with the CIB, for products sold to CB
clients through the Investment Banking, Markets or Payments
businesses. This includes revenues related to fixed income and equity
markets products. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 18 for
discussion of revenue sharing.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.3 billion, up 58%.

Net revenue was $3.5 billion, up 46%. Net interest income
was $2.7 billion, up 78%, driven by deposit margin
expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower average
deposits.

Noninterest revenue was $781 million, down 10%, driven by
lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level of credits
earned by clients that reduce such fees, partially offset by
higher investment banking revenue.

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, up 16%, largely driven
by higher compensation, including headcount growth, as well
as higher volume-related expense.

The provision for credit losses was $417 million, reflecting a
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, predominantly
driven by a deterioration in the Firm's weighted-average
economic outlook and net downgrade activity.

The provision for credit losses in the prior year was $157
million, driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit
losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
48-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for

for credit losses.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.4 billion, up 36%.

Net revenue was $4.8 billion, up 11%. Net interest income
was $1.5 billion, up 35%. Noninterest revenue was $3.3
billion, up 3%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.4 billion, up 5%,
driven by:

• a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in
CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51%
interest in the entity,

partially offset by

• lower performance fees, and

• lower management fees reflecting a decline in market
levels, predominantly offset by the removal of most
money market fund fee waivers.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.4 billion, up
17%, driven by:

• deposit margin expansion reflecting higher rates on lower

average deposit balances,

partially offset by

• an investment valuation loss, and

• tighter spreads on lower average loans.

Noninterest expense was $3.1 billion, up 8%,
predominantly driven by higher compensation due to
headcount growth, higher revenue-related compensation
and the impact of acquisitions.

The provision for credit losses was $28 million.

Quarterly results
Net income was $244 million, compared with a net loss of
$856 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was $985 million, compared with a net loss of
$881 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest
income due to higher rates.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $755 million, compared
with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, driven by:

• higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries,
associated with repositioning the investment securities
portfolio, and

• the absence of proceeds from an insurance settlement in

the prior year

partially offset by

• higher net gains on certain legacy private equity

investments, compared with net losses in the prior year.

Noninterest expense of $160 million was down $24 million.

The provision for credit losses was $370 million, reflecting
an addition to the allowance for credit losses, including an
allowance for credit losses associated with Other assets.

Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the
investment securities portfolio, and Note 12 for additional
information on the allowance for credit losses.

The change in the current period tax expense was driven by
the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S.
federal and state and local taxes that also impacted the
Firm's tax reserves.

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international
consumer growth initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the
Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital
wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in
C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the
interests of its clients, customers and investors, and
protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires,
among other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance framework
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of
risks.

Refer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management
governance and oversight.

35

Risk-based Capital Targets
The Firm’s current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1
capital ratio is 13.0%, which the Firm surpassed in both the
fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. With
consideration for an increase in the global systemically
important banks ("GSIB") surcharge in 2024, the Firm has
maintained a target ratio of 13.5% for the first quarter of
2024, which assumes no change in the Stress Capital Buffer
("SCB"). The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary from
these targets dependent on market conditions. These
targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in
effect.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business
activities and associated risks during normal economic
environments and under stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-
K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s
capital risk.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies
(“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets ("RWA"),
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III
Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding
than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to
calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39 for additional
information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital
benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per year
over a three-year period. As of March 31, 2023, the Firm's
CET1 capital reflected the remaining $1.4 billion benefit
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm phased
out 50% of the other CECL capital transition provisions
which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note
1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and the
CECL accounting guidance.

36

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics. Refer to Note 21 for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s risk-based and
leverage-based capital metrics.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a
further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress.

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-
alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from
the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a
minimum of 100%.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022

(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or

securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.

(e) End of period HQLA balances were $758.9 billion, $735.5 billion, and

$735.8 billion for March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and
March 31, 2022, respectively.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months
ended March 31, 2023, compared with the three months
period ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a return
of funds from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a result of a
dividend payment to the Parent Company.

42

The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months
ended March 31, 2023, compared with the prior year
period largely driven by an increase in HQLA from long-
term debt issuances.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during
the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with
the three months ended December 31, 2022 reflecting a
decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, primarily
due to a reduction in cash associated with a decline in
average deposits, a dividend payment to the Parent
Company, and higher average loans.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 decreased when compared
with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease
in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a
reduction in cash from a decline in deposits and loan
growth, as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible
investment securities. Refer to Note 9 for additional
information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.

Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average
LCR fluctuates from period to period due to changes in their
respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as
a result of ongoing business activity.

Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K and
the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional
information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

Internal stress testing
The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is
intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal
entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse
scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s
resolution and recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios
are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are
performed in response to specific market events or
concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the
formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its
liquidity position.

The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the
IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply
with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity
requirements, and to manage through periods of stress
when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities,
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity.
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was
approximately $700 billion and $694 billion as of
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively,
although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any
particular time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of
approximately $330 billion and $323 billion as of
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and
securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other
unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the
Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central
banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount
window and the other central banks as a primary source of
liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts
of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

As of March 31, 2023, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR
requirement, based on the Firm's current interpretation of
the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose
its quarterly average NSFR semiannually beginning in the
second half of 2023.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured
funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance
sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term
cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
may access funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term

debt, or from borrowings from the Intermediate Holding
Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are
primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and
short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities
loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding
is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity
risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-balance
sheet obligations.

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of March 31, 2023, and December 31,

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of
funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale
funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits
are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits,
which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be
stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from
customers that maintain operating service relationships with
the Firm.
Refer to pages 100-101 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form
10-K for additional disclosure on the Firm's deposit balances.

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the

Average deposits were lower for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2022. The decrease was predominantly driven by:
• declines in CIB and CB due to attrition and in AWM due to
migration into higher-yielding investments as a result of
the rising interest rate environment, partially offset by net
issuances of structured notes in CIB,

• a decline in CCB from existing accounts primarily due to
migration to higher-yielding investments and increased
customer spending, and

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's ongoing

international consumer initiatives.

Period-end deposits increased, reflecting inflows in March
2023, primarily in CCB and CB, as a result of disruptions in
the market related to recent bank failures, which changed
the outflow trend that started in the second half of 2022.
AWM also experienced deposit inflows in March which were
more than offset by migration to higher-yielding investments
by month end. The increase in period-end deposits also
reflected:

(e) Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 36-41, Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 82 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 21

and Note 22 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased
at March 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022,
due to higher secured financing of trading assets and the
impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-
making activities in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds.
The decrease in commercial paper at March 31, 2023 from
December 31, 2022, and for the average three months
ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period,
was due to lower net issuance levels resulting from short-
term liquidity management.
The decrease in average unsecured other borrowed funds
for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to
the prior year period was due to lower levels of overdrafts
as well as net maturities of structured notes classified as
other borrowed funds in CIB.

45

The Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through
securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB
advances. The following table summarizes the securitization
issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities
or redemptions for the three months ended March 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for
client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding
for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer
to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
further description of client-driven loan securitizations.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity,
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its
optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and
non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the
IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties.
The following table summarizes long-term unsecured
issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Liquidity
Risk Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 of

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and
credit-related contingent features in Note 4 for additional
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on
the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and
collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of March 31, 2023, were

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to
Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit Portfolio and
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 50-65 for a further
discussion of Credit Risk.

Refer to page 66 for a further discussion of Investment
Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk
Management on pages 106-130 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.

In the following tables, total loans include loans retained
(i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain
loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do
not include loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value
and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for
further information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes
11, 22 and 4 for additional information on the Firm’s loans,
lending-related commitments and derivative receivables.

Refer to Note 9 for information regarding the credit risk
inherent in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and
refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk
inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 50-53 and Note 11 for
further discussions of the consumer credit environment and
consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on
pages 54-62 and Note 11 for further discussions of the
wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans.

On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR
accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and
disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement
to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or
involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure
for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate
reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term
extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm
has defined these types of modifications as financial
difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the
elimination of the requirement to assess whether a
modification is reasonably expected or involves a
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs will
differ from those previously considered TDRs. Refer to Note
1 and Note 11 for further information.

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in Corporate.
(b) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, excluded operating lease assets of $11.3 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively. These operating lease assets

are included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(e) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm
has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain
conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(f) Includes billed interest and fees.
(g) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(h) Represents the notional amount of protection obtained through the issuance of credit-related notes that reference certain pools of residential real estate and

auto loans in the retained consumer portfolio.

(i) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies

of $263 million and $302 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In
addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(j) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(k) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded $54 million and $101 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due

and guaranteed by the SBA.

(l) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $11.0 billion and $23.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,

respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans were relatively flat compared to December 31, 2022
driven by higher auto loans and loans at fair value,
predominantly offset by lower retained residential real
estate loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit.
Retained loans decreased compared to December 31,
2022, reflecting paydowns, net of originations. Net
recoveries were lower for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior
year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest
rates.
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2022,
driven by an increase in Home Lending as originations
outpaced warehouse loan sales, largely offset by lower CIB
loans as sales outpaced purchases.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit
outstanding was $14.9 billion at March 31, 2023. This
amount included $4.8 billion of HELOCs that have recast
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have
been modified and $4.8 billion of interest-only balloon
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.
At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was $36.4
billion and $36.3 billion, respectively. These loans have an
interest-only payment period generally followed by an
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly
in AWM. The credit performance of this portfolio is
comparable with the performance of the broader prime
mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Modified residential real estate loans
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, residential
real estate FDMs were $38 million. In addition to FDMs, the
Firm also had $23 million of loans subject to trial
modification where the terms of the loans have not been
permanently modified, as well as $2 million of loans subject
to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings
("Chapter 7 loans"). The changes to the TDR accounting
guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and
concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial
modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs,
but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 11 for further
information.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, residential
real estate TDRs were $118 million. Refer to Note 11 for
further information on TDRs in prior periods.

modifications and loans that were in the process of active or
suspended foreclosure.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value consists of prime-quality scored
auto and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The
portfolio increased when compared to December 31, 2022
due to originations of scored Auto loans, predominantly
offset by paydowns. Net charge-offs for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 increased compared to the same
period in the prior year due to higher scored Auto charge-
offs as delinquency levels increased and vehicle valuations
declined. The scored Auto net charge-off rates were 0.47%
and 0.18% for the three months ended March 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively.

respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the

(b) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in

response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(c) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans

excluded $54 million and $101 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90
or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

52

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2022
reflecting the impact of seasonality. The March 31, 2023
30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.83%,
respectively, increased compared to the December 31,
2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and
0.68% as delinquencies continued to normalize but
remained below pre-pandemic levels. Net charge-offs
increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023
compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting
continued normalization in delinquencies.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans
typically remain on accrual status until charged off.
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further
information about this portfolio, including information
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, credit card
FDMs were $163 million. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also
had $24 million of loans subject to trial modification where
the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified.
The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the
TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment
criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications were considered
TDRs, but not FDMs.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, credit card
TDRs were $82 million.

Refer to Note 1 and Note 11 for further information.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and
counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities),
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the
loans that it originates into the market as part of its
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry
discussion on pages 56-59 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM
and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the
wholesale methodology is applied when determining the
allowance for loan losses.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, credit
continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining low.

As of March 31, 2023, the increase in nonperforming
exposure was driven by loans, resulting from client-specific
downgrades in CIB and CB, partially offset by a reduction in
lending-related commitments.

As of March 31, 2023, retained loans increased $654
million driven by CB, largely offset by a decline in AWM.
Lending-related commitments increased $12.6 billion
driven by net portfolio activity in CB and CIB, including an
increase in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing
portfolio in CB.

BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the
internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on
internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against
certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity.
Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2023, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or
changes in market conditions.

55

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries
with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value was $34.4 billion and $31.3 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, representing approximately 3.0% and
2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. Criticized exposure increased, driven by client-specific downgrades
largely in Real Estate, Consumer and Retail, Industrials, and Healthcare, partially offset by client-specific upgrades. Of the
$34.4 billion of criticized exposure at March 31, 2023, approximately half was undrawn and $31.5 billion was performing.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The industry of
risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's
2022 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to
Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual
loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2023
and 2022. Since March 31, 2022, nonaccrual loan
exposure decreased by $148 million driven by
Transportation, civic organizations and SPEs, due to
paydowns, predominantly offset by Consumer & Retail and
Industrials due to client-specific downgrades.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically
covered by collateral agreements due to their short
maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily
— was approximately 89% and 87% at March 31, 2023,
and December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements and for a further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets was $59.3 billion and $70.9
billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022,
respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by market
movements in CIB Markets. Derivative receivables represent
the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect
to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the
related cash collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash
collateral that may be used as security when the fair value
of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in
the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current
credit risk should also take into consideration other
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The
benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master
netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the
derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis,
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These
receivables are reported within accrued interest and
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance
sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage
risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations
in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions
from its market-making activities, including the
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables.
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature
of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives the Firm
is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty.
For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures
and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”)
derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk
of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”).
Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk
exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use
of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains
credit protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related
notes. Information on credit portfolio management
activities is provided in the table below.

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022
Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies
and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for
credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and
investment securities.

Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 50-53,
Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 54-62 and Note 11 for
additional information on the consumer and wholesale
credit portfolios.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on
pages 74-76 for further information on the allowance for
credit losses and related management judgments.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses generally consists of:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,

which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2023 was
$22.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.1 billion from
December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for
credit losses was predominantly driven by a deterioration in
the Firm's weighted-average economic outlook, including
the impact from changes to the Firm’s macroeconomic
scenarios, and the additional weight placed on the relative
adverse scenario. The additional weight placed on the
relative adverse scenario reflects an increased probability
of a moderate recession due to tightening financial
conditions, including higher inflation, changes in monetary
policy, and geopolitical risks.

The net addition to the allowance consisted of:

• $726 million in wholesale, which also reflected net

downgrade activity, and an addition to the allowance for
credit losses associated with Other assets in Corporate,
and

• $416 million in consumer.

The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of
$587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the
TDR accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further
information.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions provided in the table below,
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate
peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.2%
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.

(a) Represents the impact to the allowance for loan losses upon the Firm's adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. The

adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance
using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") methodology. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based
allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for
which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to apply. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented.

Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") loans.
(c) At March 31, 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had an allowance for credit losses of $241 million

associated with Other assets in Corporate and $20 million associated with certain accounts receivable in CIB.

(d) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio
or from principal investments. The investment securities
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability
management objectives. Principal investments are
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are
typically intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists
of high-quality securities. At March 31, 2023, the Treasury
and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the
allowance for credit losses, was $608.1 billion, and the
average credit rating of the securities comprising the
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on
pages 33-34 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-47 for
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market
Risk Management on pages 67-72 for further information
on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial
instruments representing ownership interests or other
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance
sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to
support underserved communities and minority-owned
businesses.

the principal investment portfolios as March 31, 2023 and

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held
for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 131-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities
that give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate
those measures accordingly over time.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures,
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page
148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for information
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on
pages 136-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature

of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions
revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's
internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening
of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now
reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated
average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR have decreased
driven by a reduction in nickel-related exposure when compared to the same period in the prior year.

(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans, MSR, and related hedges.
(e) The increase in Corporate and other LOB VaR is driven by higher market values for a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.
(f) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification

benefit is not meaningful.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR decreased by $14 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 when compared with
December 31, 2022, reflecting reductions in exposure across
fixed income, equities, and commodities.

Year over year results
Average total VaR decreased by $16 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023, compared with the same
period in the prior year predominantly due to a reduction in
the nickel-related counterparty exposure in Credit Portfolio
VaR.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution
of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the
backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day.
Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the
historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100
trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number
of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended March 31, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 259 days, and observed 16 VaR
backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 44 of the 64 days,
and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and
three months ended March 31, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily
Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals.
Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart
below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

as the level of loans across the industry and competition
for deposits.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid
could change upon a given change in market interest
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and
other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and
other factors. The Firm is currently evaluating the modeling
of repricing lags for deposits in its earnings-at-risk
scenarios. Incorporating repricing lags, in the current
environment, would significantly affect the U.S. dollar
interest rate scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios
expected to result in a positive sensitivity, and lower
interest rate scenarios expected to result in a negative
sensitivity, on the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. While a relevant
measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-
at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s
net interest income. Refer to Outlook on page 8 for
additional information.

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table
below.

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of
March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022
primarily reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s
balance sheet.
As of March 31, 2023, the Firm’s sensitivity to the +/-100
basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is
primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities
repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while
a +/-100 basis points shift in long-term rates is primarily
the result of a greater impact from assets repricing
compared to the impact of liabilities repricing.

Structural interest rate risk management
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk
arises not only from trading activities but also from the
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits,
issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio.

One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate
risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates
the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S.
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies).
These simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
132 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term
rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many
different factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates,
the time since origination, and other factors which are
updated periodically based on historical experience.
Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's
earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain
assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative
Easing that are highly uncertain and require management
judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held
by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by
actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary
policy, including through the use of the Reverse
Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors
that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario
involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates
increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term
rates staying at current levels were not material to the
Firm’s earnings-at-risk at March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022.
In addition to earnings-at-risk, the Firm also measures
Economic Value Sensitivity (EVS). EVS stress tests the
longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the
sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily
retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as
well as related hedges, under various interest rate
scenarios. In accordance with the CTC structural interest
rate risk policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a
percentage of CET1.

JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the
potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant
market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as the movement in market
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political
or other significant developments which adversely affect
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be
impacted by these developments and measures the extent
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Refer to pages 139-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk
management.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2023 and their
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s
internal country risk management approach, and does not
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate
from period to period due to client activity and market
flows.

The increase in exposure to Germany was predominantly
driven by increases in cash placed with the central bank of
Germany and in debt securities, due to client-driven
market-making activities.

The decrease in exposure to Australia was predominantly
driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank
of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting from
changes in interest rates.

The Firm continues to monitor potential impacts to the Firm
associated with the war in Ukraine. As of March 31, 2023,
exposure to Russia was approximately $500 million. This
amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of
clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates
are integral to understanding its reported results. The
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has
established policies and control procedures intended to
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,
independently reviewed and applied consistently from
period to period. The methods used and judgments made
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or
liabilities and the related business and risk management
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are
intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses generally consists of:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated).

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities,

which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of
historical loss experience, assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's
2022 Form 10-K for further information on these
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses;
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63-65 and
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates
hundreds of macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty

74

variables. The specific variables that have the greatest
effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by
portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S.

unemployment and HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.

unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.
interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices,
commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one
reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit
losses because management considers a wide variety of
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and relative
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining
approximately 3.0% lower at the end of the eight-quarter
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.3% in
the first quarter of 2024; and lower national HPI with a
peak difference of approximately 9.3% in the fourth
quarter of 2024.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of
reasons, including:
• The allowance as of March 31, 2023, reflects credit

losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario
due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis

cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes
in macroeconomic variables.

• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition

and borrower behavior can significantly affect the
allowance for credit losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2023, the Firm
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering
offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative
components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the
comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures
below reflect the following differences:

• An increase of approximately $650 million for residential

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.5 billion for credit card

loans

• An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and
appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2023.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for
further information.

netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation
based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $11.5 billion and
$11.3 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a description
of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated
with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with
the accounting for income taxes.

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing
goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on
page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
description of the significant valuation judgments
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill,
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of
March 31, 2023.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
estimates and judgments associated with establishing
litigation reserves.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment.
The type and level of judgment required is largely
dependent on the amount of observable market information
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using
internally developed valuation models and other valuation
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are
therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more
significant than those required when estimating the fair
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument
within level 3, management must first determine the
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of
fair value for individual financial instruments.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-
looking statements. These statements can be identified by the
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,”
“goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-
looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current
expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances,
results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this
Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in
its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make forward-
looking statements orally to investors, analysts,
representatives of the media and others.
All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firm’s
control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual future results may differ
materially from those set forth in its forward-looking
statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks
and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain
factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in
the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and political
conditions and geopolitical events, including the war in
Ukraine;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,

including capital and liquidity requirements affecting the
Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to address
those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and

scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices, including
dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Changes in FDIC assessments;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including changes

in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending or

savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its capital and

liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or its

subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,

environmental and sustainability concerns that may arise,
including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an economic
slowdown or other economic or market disruption,
including, but not limited to, in the interest rate
environment;

78

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its

counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities.

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could be different from these estimates. In the
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments
have been included such that this interim financial
information is fairly stated.

These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by
the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.

Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s
accounting policies regarding consolidation.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP
also permits securities financing activities to be presented
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting
agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances
where it has determined that the specified conditions are
met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.

Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023
Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio
Layer Method

The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge
a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the
portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be
included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size of
the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This
guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that can be
used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and
disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting
adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm
elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designate
those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon
adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained
earnings was not material.

Refer to Note 4 and Note 9 for additional information.

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures

The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting
and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the
requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted
cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a
non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to
troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for
these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-
modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-
modification effective interest rate.

The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based
allowance approach for modified loans to troubled
borrowers for all portfolios except modified nonaccrual
risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying
a DCF methodology. Refer to Note 12 for a description of
the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-
specific allowance approach.

84

This guidance was adopted under the modified
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to
the allowance for credit losses of $587 million and an
increase to retained earnings of $446 million, after-tax
predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit
card.

The adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure
requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess
whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a
concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty
consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction,
other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a
combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined
these types of modifications as financial difficulty
modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the
requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably
expected or involves a concession, the population of loans
considered FDMs will differ from those previously
considered TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of
current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination
year.

Refer to Note 11 for further information.

85

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets,
liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at
fair value and the fair value hierarchy.

(a) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $78.9 billion and $73.8 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-

related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S.
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have
been included in each period presented.

88

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).
(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be

classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,
private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $976 million and $950 million, respectively. Included in these balances at March 31, 2023, and
December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $40 million and $43 million, respectively, and other assets of $936 million and $907 million, respectively.
(e) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included $10.2 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.4 billion and
$6.8 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to
sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $3.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit
associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of
such inputs. While the determination to classify an
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable
components (that is, components that are actively quoted
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs
are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The range of values presented in the table is representative
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted
averages of the input values presented in the table are
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that
the input is being used to value.

In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the
characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each
balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated

balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $732 million, nonagency securities of $5 million and non-trading loans of $958 million.
(c) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $25 million, nonagency securities of $10 million, trading loans of $72 million and non-trading

loans of $325 million.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $854 million and non-trading loans of $196 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $796 million including $215 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is

generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant
both individually and in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-

based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

90

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of
the underlying instruments and external market factors that
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s
positions.

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in
fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. When a
determination is made to classify a financial instrument
within level 3, the determination is based on the
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair
value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3
components, observable components (that is, components
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table
below include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2
risk management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the
effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to
such level 3 instruments.

• $891 million of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net

derivative receivables due to market movements.

• $1.5 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly

driven by an increase in the fair value of long-term debt
due to market movements.

Three months ended March 31, 2022

• $2.0 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by
gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market
movements and MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds
on higher rates.

• $2.2 billion of net gains on liabilities, largely driven by
gains in long-term debt due to market movements.

Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2022, for those items measured at fair
value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 95 for
further information on changes impacting items measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Three months ended March 31, 2023
Level 3 assets were $23.8 billion at March 31, 2023,
relatively flat compared to December 31, 2022, with no
individually significant movements.

Refer to the sections below for additional information.

Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair
value on a recurring basis
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, there were no
significant transfers from level 2 into level 3.
For the three months ended March 31, 2023, significant
transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following:
• $953 million of gross equity derivative receivables as a

result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the
significance of unobservable inputs.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, significant
transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:
• $1.2 billion of total debt and equity instruments, largely
due to equity securities of $853 million driven by a
decrease in observability as a result of restricted access to
certain markets.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, there were no
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2.

All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or
significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur
at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which
they occur.

Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of total
realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured
at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated.
These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s risk
management activities where the financial instruments are
classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $179 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2023, $158 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.

(b) Of the $833 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2023, $14 million related to residential real estate

loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are
valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with
actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 13% to 48% with a weighted average of 25%.

Nonrecurring fair value changes
The following table presents the total change in value of

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative),
with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed
necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for
private equity direct investments.

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of March
31, 2023 and 2022, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the
periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair
value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2022 was $4.1 billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward

and downward carrying value changes.

(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2023 were $1.5 billion.
(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2023 were $(1.0) billion.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 37 million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”).
These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”)
at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B
shares into Visa A shares was 1.5991 at March 31, 2023, and the conversion rate may be adjusted by Visa depending on
developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of
those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2023, there is significant
uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for
the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not
considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.

In connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the
shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative
instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make
periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue
as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value
using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of
the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in
other income. As of March 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23 million Visa B shares that the
Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,

contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as

(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is recognized at fair value at the inception of the

guarantees.

(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without
notice. Refer to page 169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm
commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

•

•

Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise

be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

•

•

Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded
derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are
carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information
presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk
management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in
principal transactions revenue were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively

managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such
risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected

structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if

applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.

At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value
option was elected was $9.4 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $12 million and $24
million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further
information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.

The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited
number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge

accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as
derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or
for other purposes.

The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure
category.

103

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by
contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty,
have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the
master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on
the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables,
the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit
risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as
“Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the
purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined
in the LCR rule;

• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date

presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and

• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been

either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related
contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that
contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated
collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022,
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be
triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade),
nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS

securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.

(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual

of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.

(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.

(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net

realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward

points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.

(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-

currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $14.6 billion and $26.0 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, to which

the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income
in future periods.

(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not

reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is
$19.9 billion and $20.3 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $217 million and $221 million, respectively.

(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method
hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. At March 31,
2023, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $38.9 billion, of which $24.5 billion was designated as hedged. The
cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $21 million. Refer to Note 1 and Note 9 for additional information.

(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in
future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net
interest income in future periods.

(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value

hedging relationships.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of

gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and
2022.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.4) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at
March 31, 2023, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated,
the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately
seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the
maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated
forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses
The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign

exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income.

(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Firm

reclassified a pre-tax loss of $41 million to other revenue related to the acquisition of CIFM. Refer to Note 19 for further information.

109

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain
risks associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk
management categories above are included in this
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer
to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk
management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated
in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage
risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities,
including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments,
warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and
foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees
and related income.

(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated

with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These
derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is
included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.

(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of
the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic
hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than
the notional amount of protection sold.

(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of

protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.

(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on

the identical reference instrument.

The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives
as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is
based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the
reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where
JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Note 9 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading
assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the
Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO
in connection with its asset-liability management activities.
At March 31, 2023, the investment securities portfolio
consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of
AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where
not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio
layer method hedge accounting guidance which permitted a
transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm
transferred obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with

a carrying value of $7.1 billion resulting in the recognition of
$38 million net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. This
transfer was a noncash transaction. Refer to Note 1 and Note
19 for additional information.
During 2022, the Firm transferred $78.3 billion of
investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital
management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized
losses of $4.8 billion on the securities at the date of transfer.
Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The

effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed
portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the
average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.

(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $(29) million and the portfolio layer fair value

hedge basis adjustments of $21 million at March 31, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of
$(61) million at March 31, 2023.

(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated

weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately seven years for agency residential MBS, and six years for both agency
residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information
regarding securities financing agreements for which the fair
value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further
information regarding assets pledged and collateral
received in securities financing agreements.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of
the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31,
2023 and December 31, 2022. When the Firm has obtained
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with
the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance

sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net
amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other
assets and the obligation to return those securities within
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Firm held $871 million and $692 million, respectively, of financial assets for
which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in
trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

121

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following
categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
• Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer
to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option.
Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage
Disclosures accounting guidance as discussed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and
disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure requirements for FDMs. The disclosure requirements
for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form
10-K for a detailed discussion on loan modifications prior to January 1, 2023, which were accounted for and reported as TDRs.
This new guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.

Consumer, excluding
credit card
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)

Credit card

Wholesale(c)(d)

• Credit card loans

• Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.
(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is

applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral,

purpose, and type of borrower.

(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to

individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB). Refer to Note
14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

accrued interest receivables of $11 million and $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(b) Loans (other than those for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan

fees or costs. These amounts were not material as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

(a) Reclassifications of loans to held-for-sale are non-cash transactions.
(b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm’s voluntary repurchases of certain delinquent loans from loan pools
as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. The Firm
typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable
requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.

(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $663 million and $3.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are

predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards.

Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-
related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue was $23 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2023, of which $27 million related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-
related commitments was $38 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, of which $34 million related to loans. In
addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision
for credit losses.

123

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans,
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market.
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only
payment period and certain payment-option loans that may
result in negative amortization.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at March 31, 2023 and

December 31, 2022

(b) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within

their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(c) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at March 31, 2023 and

December 31, 2022. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien
position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed
by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2023, approximately
9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered

collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of
the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $45 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the
extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all
available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO

band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2023.
(k) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Loan modifications
The Firm grants certain modifications of residential real
estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty,
which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The
Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs,
generally provide various modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited
to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-
insignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness that
would otherwise have been required under the terms of the
original agreement, are considered FDMs.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, residential
real estate FDMs were $38 million. The financial effects of
the FDMs, which were largely in the form of term extensions
and interest rate reductions, included extending the
weighted-average life of the loans up to 24 years, and
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate
from 5.84% to 3.57%. There were no additional
commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs. In
addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $23 million of loans
subject to a trial modification, and $2 million of Chapter 7
loans. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance
eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession
assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and
Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs.

For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications
of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted
concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial
difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as
TDRs. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, new
TDRs were $118 million. There were no additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real
estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Refer to Note 12
of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on TDRs.

the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the
modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions
offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those
granted on permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and

payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.

(a) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans

excluded $54 million and $101 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90
or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $53
million and $76 million, respectively, were no longer accruing interest
based on the guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal balance
of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified
reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA.
There were no loans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90
or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31, 2023
and December 31, 2022.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In

accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves
subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was
not material for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.
(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on

Loan modifications
The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January
1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60
months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card under long-term programs. If the cardholder does not
comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in
accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

There were no FDMs that re-defaulted during the three

For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit
card loans remain in the modification program and continue
to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard
charge-off policy.

For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications
of credit card loans where the Firm granted concessions to
borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were
generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Refer to Note
12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on TDRs.

Loan modifications
The Firm grants certain modifications of wholesale loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January

The following table provides information on the payment

Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were
considered TDRs.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, new TDRs
were $418 million and reflected the extension of maturity
dates, covenant waivers, receipt of assets in partial
satisfaction of the loan and deferral of principal and
interest payments, predominantly in the Commercial and
Industrial and Other loan classes. For the three months
ended March 31, 2022, the impact of these modifications
were not material to the Firm.

As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess
whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is
greater than those previously considered TDRs.

As of March 31, 2023, additional commitments to lend to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose
Commercial and industrial loans have been modified as
FDMs were $909 million.

FDMs to borrowers in the Other loan class were $63 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The financial
effect of FDMs extended the loans by a weighted-average of
four months and were generally in the form of term
extensions. There were no additional commitments to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans
have been modified as FDMs.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, Secured by
real estate FDMs were not material and there were no
additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as
FDMs.

Note 12 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments.

On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings
accounting guidance as described in Note 1.

The adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement
to measure the allowance for TDRs using a DCF
methodology and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-
based approach for modified loans to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF methodology is
still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must
be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of
the pre-modification effective interest rate.

The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance
approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance
approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all
portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance
approach will continue to apply.

This guidance was adopted under the modified
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to
the allowance for credit losses of $587 million and an
increase to retained earnings of $446 million, after-tax
predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit
card.

Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and
the related accounting policies.

(b) At March 31, 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had an allowance for credit losses of $241 million

associated with Other assets in Corporate and $20 million associated with certain accounts receivable in CIB.

(c) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented.

Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified PCD loans.

(d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(e) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, lending-related commitments excluded $16.0 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit
card portfolio segment; $861.2 billion and $757.3 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $17.5 billion and $32.9 billion,
respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

138

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2023 was
$22.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.1 billion from
December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for
credit losses was predominantly driven by a deterioration in
the Firm's weighted-average economic outlook, including
the impact from changes to the Firm’s macroeconomic
scenarios, and the additional weight placed on the relative
adverse scenario. The additional weight placed on the
relative adverse scenario reflects an increased probability
of a moderate recession due to tightening financial
conditions, including higher inflation, changes in monetary
policy, and geopolitical risks.

The net addition to the allowance consisted of:

• $726 million in wholesale, which also reflected net

downgrade activity, and an addition to the allowance for
credit losses associated with Other assets in Corporate,
and

• $416 million in consumer.

The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of
$587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the
TDR accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further
information.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions provided in the table below,
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate
peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.2%
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future
periods.

“Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE
is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or
(4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is
considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-
sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase
Issuance Trust.

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages
and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well
as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial
interests in the securitization trusts.

140

The following tables present the total unpaid principal
amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit

risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements,
and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The
Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Multi-seller conduits
In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held
$10.4 billion and $13.8 billion of the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively,
which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity
and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were
$9.8 billion and $10.6 billion at March 31, 2023, and
December 31, 2022, respectively, and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”)
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party.
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.
(b) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include

third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.

(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of
JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $1.1 billion and $2.1 billion at March 31, 2023, and
December 31, 2022, respectively.

(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the
quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a
variable interest that could potentially be significant, the
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance
sheets in the same manner it would record and report
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.

Tax credit vehicles
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A
third party is typically the general partner or managing

143

member and has control over the significant activities of the
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by
equity investments and funding commitments, was $30.2
billion at both March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of
which $10.7 billion and $10.6 billion was unfunded at
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.
The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of
loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital
investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer
to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
further information on affordable housing tax credits and
Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.

In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders
for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the
underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the
power to make decisions that significantly impact the
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.

The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to
customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2023 and December 31,
2022 was $5.9 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The
fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2023
and December 31, 2022 was $8.4 billion and $8.2 billion,
respectively.

Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,
commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.

Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended March 31,

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization
activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g.,
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed
by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for
additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for
additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain
loans due to material breaches of representations and
warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan

pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or
guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage
loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets
as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(b) Predominantly foreign currency adjustments.

Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to
Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated
fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the
future, which could result in a material impairment charge
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the
associated goodwill.

As of March 31, 2023, the Firm reviewed current economic
conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as
actual business results and projections of business
performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31,
2023, or December 31, 2022, nor was goodwill written off
due to impairment during the three months ended
March 31, 2023 or 2022.

146

Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of the
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.

(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of loans that prepaid within 90 days of

settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.

(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and

expected prepayments.

(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a
short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer
advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and

expected prepayments.

(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and

changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be
linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a
particular assumption may have on the fair value is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the
impact of the initial change.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and outlines
hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate
adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

Note 20 – Restricted cash and other restricted
assets
Refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s restricted cash and other
restricted assets.

Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by
various regulatory authorities based on the particular
activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries.

The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established
by other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. As part of its
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements,
the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain
restrictions on cash and other assets.

The following table presents the components of the Firm’s

CECL regulatory capital transition
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital
benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per year
over a three-year period. As of March 31, 2023, the Firm's
CET1 capital reflected the remaining $1.4 billion benefit
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm phased
out 50% of the other CECL capital transition provisions
which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
further information on CECL capital transition provisions.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes similar
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s
principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to
maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to
these capital requirements established by their respective
primary regulators.

The following table presents the risk-based regulatory

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and other
commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The
contractual amount of these financial instruments
represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most
of these commitments and guarantees have historically
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the
Firm’s related accounting policies.

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments
is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments.

The following table summarizes the contractual amounts
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The amounts
in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain
scored business banking lending-related commitments
represent the total available credit for these products. The
Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all
available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card
and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as
permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60
days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of
the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the
borrower.

(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.
(d) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $64 million and $71 million,

respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $8.2 billion at both March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, for standby letters of
credit and other financial guarantees; $350 million and $512 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve
these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.

(e) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $340.9 billion
and $298.5 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and
government agencies.

(f) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program

and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses.

(g) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, primarily includes unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity investments, unfunded

commitments to purchase secondary market loans, and other equity investment commitments.

(h) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 includes net markdowns on held-for-sale positions related to unfunded commitments in the bridge financing

portfolio.

(i) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-

related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.

157

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally
consist of commitments for working capital and general
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing
organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of
credit.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are
conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings,
trade financings and similar transactions.

The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 11 for further information on internal risk ratings.

Merchant charge-backs
Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a
merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant Services business
in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed
processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the
cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s
issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder
and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the
Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the
Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded
to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment
or performance risk related to charge-backs.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to
Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on these derivatives.

The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying
as guarantees as of March 31, 2023, and December 31,

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives
market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Loan sales and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are
breached by the Firm.

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.

Sponsored member repo program
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements
through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm
minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house
therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments
line on page 157. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.

Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 157 of
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for additional information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral
Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral.

Pledged assets
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and
FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets
pledged.

Collateral
The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 24 – Litigation

Contingencies
As of March 31, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and
affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government
investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The
litigations range from individual actions involving a single
plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of
class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by
both governmental agencies and self-regulatory
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve
each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies
and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort
and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel
legal theories.

The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to
approximately $1.2 billion at March 31, 2023. This
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
was based upon information available as of that date for
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
involves significant judgment, given:

•

•

•

•

the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in
preliminary stages,

the existence in many such proceedings of multiple
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability
(if any) has yet to be determined,

the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the
proceedings, including issues regarding class
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and

the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of
such proceedings, including where the Firm has made
assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or
other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of
adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those
assumptions prove to be incorrect.

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may
vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings.

1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia
by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian
state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan
(Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges
“dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in
relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million,
from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by
1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited.
In September 2022, the Firm filed an application
challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s
jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB
discontinued its claim against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but
requested permission of the Court to refile in the future,
which the Court took under consideration.

Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase
entities into residential housing projects developed by the
Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors
filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions
brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or
failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’
petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India
and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately
$31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued
an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and
other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities
and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,
violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P.
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm
previously reported settlements with certain government
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and
trading activities and controls related to those activities.
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions
that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on
the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)

160

through the ten-year disqualification period following the
antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental
inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter
which is currently pending before the South Africa
Competition Tribunal.

With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a
consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of
persons who transacted in FX futures and options on
futures. Although certain members of the settlement class
filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an
agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December
2022. The District Court denied certification of a putative
class action against the Firm and other foreign exchange
dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign
currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary
judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023.
Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition,
some FX-related individual and putative class actions based
on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed
outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the
Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve
one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In a
putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition
Appeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have
appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class
certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in
principle has been reached in the putative class action,
which remains subject to court approval.

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases
for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on
appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of New York.

The original class action was divided into two separate
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the
parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement
which amends and supersedes the prior settlement
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants
collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the
approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from
the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court.
In March 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s approval of the
settlement, and two merchants have filed petitions for
rehearing of the Appellate Court’s approval. Based on the
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended

161

class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in
part, and denied the motion in part.

Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages
class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as
well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of
those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached
settlements with the merchants who opted out representing
approximately 65% of the combined Mastercard-branded
and Visa-branded payment card sales volume.

Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York
which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly
facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other
unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein
until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, is
a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking
victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in
December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government
of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain
Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
moved to dismiss both complaints. In March 2023, the
Court granted in part and denied in part JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.’s motions to dismiss, allowing some claims to
proceed in both lawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading
the Firm’s former employee, James Edward Staley, into the
two lawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification,
contribution, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the
faithless servant doctrine. In April 2023, Staley moved to
dismiss the complaints. Also in April 2023, the putative
class action plaintiff filed a motion for class certification
seeking to represent a class of alleged sex-trafficking
victims of Epstein. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. intends to
oppose both motions.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from
various governmental agencies and entities around the
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s
(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain
subject, continues. In December 2016, the European
Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other
banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules
relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that
decision with the European General Court, and that appeal
is pending.

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along
with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been
dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a
lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and
other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement
to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In
September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint
in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint
asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have
moved to dismiss. The Firm’s settlements of putative class
actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and
the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill
Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in
November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss
franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval.

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust
law and New York State common law in connection with an
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous
exchange trading for securities lending transactions.
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which
defendants have opposed.

Shareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class
actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting
to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the
Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and
former officers.

Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical
trading practices by former employees in the precious
metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct
which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the
DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary
activities that were separately the subject of a resolution
between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in
November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits
was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in
May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust
enrichment claims relating to the historical trading
practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which
were the subject of the resolutions described above. In

December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to
dismiss this action in full, and in January 2023, the plaintiff
filed a notice of appeal, which remains pending. A second
shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York in
December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices
and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty
and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is
excused from making a demand to commence litigation
because such a demand would have been futile. In addition,
a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan
Chase common stock during the putative class period,
alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially
false or misleading because they did not disclose certain
information relating to the historical trading practices and
conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended
complaint in this action.

A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March
2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty
and violations of federal securities laws based on the
alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise
adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records
preservation requirements which were the subject of
resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and
the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the
amended complaint is pending.

*     *     *

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may
be initiated from time to time in the future.

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on
management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $176 million and
$119 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively. There is no assurance that the
Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the
future.

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters

162

present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material
legal proceedings described above and after taking into
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating
results for a particular period, depending on, among other
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

163

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are
determined based on the products and services provided, or
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in
which financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments.

Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
segment results as of or for the three months ended March
31, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm’s
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S.
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the

Segment results and reconciliation(a)

reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the
Firm’s managed basis.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is
referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions,
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are
reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the
LOBs may change.

Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on
capital allocation.

Note 26 – Subsequent events
On May 1, 2023, the Firm acquired the substantial majority
of assets and assumed the deposits and certain other
liabilities of First Republic Bank from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. In carrying out this transaction, the
Firm expects to further advance the Firm’s wealth
management strategy and complement its existing
franchises. The Firm is estimating the impact of the
acquisition on its financial statements and expects these
estimates to be further refined during the purchase
accounting measurement period. The Firm has concluded
that, due to the limited amount of time since the date of
this transaction, in accordance with the accounting
guidance, it is impracticable to provide all of the disclosures
required for a business combination at the time of this
filing.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of
the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.

May 3, 2023

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the
“Firm”) as of March 31, 2023, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the three-month
periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, including the
related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim
financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not
aware of any material modifications that should be made to
the accompanying interim financial statements for them to
be in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of
the Firm as of December 31, 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the
year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report
dated February 21, 2023, which included a paragraph
describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit
losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
information as of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a
third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one
party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to
another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include,
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to
the protection seller for the difference between the face

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However,
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.

Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the
origination date.

Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data
where actual data is not available. As a result, the
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values;
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Mortgage product types:

Alt-A
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than
subprime loans but have characteristics that would
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A
lending characteristics may include one or more of the
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv)
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest

170

accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date
triggers.

Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have
reliable payment histories.

Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v)
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MREL: Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible
liabilities

MSR: Mortgage servicing rights

offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained
loans for the reporting period.

cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs
generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all
sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM: Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S.
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and

interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically
maintained on nonaccrual status.

assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-based
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees
under its share-based compensation programs, which
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock
and participating securities, based on their respective rights
to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.

approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through
disclosure requirements which allow market participants to
assess the risk and capital profiles of banks.

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a
lending institution to generate income in excess of its
provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer
spread, which is the difference between the price at which
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and
the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument.
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and
losses on financial and other instruments (including those
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in
client-driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a

172

Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III
Advanced.

management solutions across equities, fixed income,
alternatives and money market funds to institutional and
retail investors providing for a broad range of clients’
investment needs.

Global Private Bank: provides retirement products and
services, brokerage, custody, trusts and estates, loans,
mortgages, deposits and investment management to high
net worth clients.

AWM’s client segments consist of the following:

Private Banking: clients include high- and ultra-high-net-
worth individuals, families, money managers and business
owners.

Global Institutional: clients include both corporate and
public institutions, endowments, foundations, nonprofit
organizations and governments worldwide.

Global Funds: clients include financial intermediaries and
individual investors.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall
fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of
industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is
derived from a weighted average of the performance
associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled
funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with
fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer

175

categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage
of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to
represent the star rating of all other funds, except for
Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level.
The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and
five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers.
Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and
Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the
oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.

Refer to the Market Risk Management section of
Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 131-138
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation,
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively.

The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless,
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls
may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance
that any such deficiencies will not result in significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the
future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to
“Management’s report on internal control over financial
reporting” on page 155 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-
K for further information. There was no change in the Firm’s
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that
occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023,
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Part II – Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information
that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3:
Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk
factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk
Factors on pages 9-32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-
K and Forward-Looking Statements on page 78 of this Form
10-Q. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented,
sets forth the material risk factors that could affect
JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations.
Readers should not consider any descriptions of such
factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could
affect the Firm.

JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition of certain assets and
liabilities of First Republic Bank may not result in all of the
benefits anticipated.

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired the
substantial majority of assets and assumed certain liabilities
of First Republic Bank from the FDIC (the “Acquisition”).
There can be no assurance that the Acquisition will have the
anticipated positive results, including with respect to:

• the total cost of integration
• the time required to complete the integration
• the amount of longer-term cost savings
• the overall performance of the assets and liabilities

acquired in the Acquisition, or

• an improved price for JPMorgan Chase’s common stock.

Integration of an acquired business can be complex and
costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant
accounting and data processing systems and management
controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with
employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners.
Integration efforts could divert management attention and
resources, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s
operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could
incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the
Acquisition and its integration efforts.

Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that
cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or
cause clients and customers to move their business to
competing financial institutions. It is possible that the
integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing
businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls,
procedures and policies that could adversely affect
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to maintain relationships with
clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition,
the loss of key employees in connection with the Acquisition
could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to
successfully conduct its business.

Supervision and regulation
Refer to the Supervision and regulation section on pages 4–
8 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for information on
Supervision and Regulation.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds.

The Firm did not have any unregistered sale of equity
securities during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Repurchases under the common share repurchase
program
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 36-41 of this
Form 10-Q and pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases under the
Firm’s common share repurchase program.

The Firm is authorized to purchase up to $30 billion under
its common share repurchase program previously approved
by the Board of Directors.
