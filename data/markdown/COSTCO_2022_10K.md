undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.

Item 1—Business

PART I

Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (Costco  or  the  Company)  began  operations  in  1983,  in  Seattle,  Washington.  We  are
principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, United
Kingdom  (U.K.),  Korea,  Taiwan, Australia,  Spain,  France,  China,  and  Iceland.  Costco  operated  838,  815,  and  795  warehouses  worldwide  at
August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and  August  30,  2020,  respectively.  The  Company  operates  e-commerce  websites  in  the  U.S.,  Canada,
Mexico, U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”

We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first
three  quarters  consist  of  three  periods  each,  and  the  fourth  quarter  consists  of  four  periods  (five  weeks  in  the  thirteenth  period  in  a  53-week
year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2022,
2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.

General

We  operate  membership  warehouses  and  e-commerce  websites  based  on  the  concept  that  offering  our  members  low  prices  on  a  limited
selection  of  nationally-branded  and  private-label  products  in  a  wide  range  of  categories  will  produce  high  sales  volumes  and  rapid  inventory
turnover.  When  combined  with  the  operating  efficiencies  achieved  by  volume  purchasing,  efficient  distribution  and  reduced  handling  of
merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross
margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while
taking advantage of early payment discounts.

We  buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points  (depots)  or  directly  to  our
warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight
volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. For our e-commerce operations
we  ship  merchandise  through  our  depots,  our  logistics  operations  for  big  and  bulky  items,  as  well  as  through  drop-ship  and  other  delivery
arrangements with our suppliers.

Table of Contents

Our  average  warehouse  space  is  approximately  146,000  square  feet,  with  newer  units  being  slightly  larger.  Floor  plans  are  designed  for
economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted
principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and
using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.

Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of
operation  are  shorter  than  many  other  retailers,  and  due  to  other  efficiencies  inherent  in  a  warehouse-type  operation,  labor  costs  are  lower
relative  to  the  volume  of  sales.  Merchandise  is  generally  stored  on  racks  above  the  sales  floor  and  displayed  on  pallets  containing  large
quantities,  reducing  labor  required.  In  general,  with  variations  by  country,  our  warehouses  accept  certain  credit  cards,  including  Costco  co-
branded  cards,  debit  cards,  cash  and  checks,  Executive  member  2%  reward  certificates,  co-brand  cardholder  rebates,  and  our  proprietary
stored-value card (shop card).

Our  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are  consistently  lower  than
elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per
warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs
online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack
quantities only.

In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a
90-day  return  policy  and  provide,  free  of  charge,  technical  support  services,  as  well  as  an  extended  warranty. Additional  third-party  warranty
coverage is sold on certain electronic items.

We offer merchandise and services in the following categories:

Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):

•

•

•

Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)

Non-Foods (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden and patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and
seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small  appliances,  furniture,  domestics,  housewares,  special  order
kiosk, and jewelry)

Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)

Warehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-
commerce, business centers, travel, and other)

Warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number
of  warehouses  with  gas  stations  varies  significantly  by  country,  and  we  have  no  gasoline  business  in  Korea  or  China.  We  operated  668  gas
stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.

Our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-
commerce  operations  give  members  convenience  and  a  broader  selection  of  goods  and  services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented
approximately 7% of total net sales in 2022. This figure does not include other services we offer online in certain countries such as business
delivery,  travel,  same-day  grocery,  and  various  other  services.  Our  business  centers  carry  items  tailored  specifically  for  food  services,
convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco
Travel offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the
U.K.).

We have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise
from any one supplier. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints, including disruptions and delays that have impacted
and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternatives. We
also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is
significant.

Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.

Membership

Our  members  may  utilize  their  memberships  at  all  of  our  warehouses  and  websites.  Gold  Star  memberships  are  available  to  individuals;
Business  memberships  are  limited  to  businesses,  including  individuals  with  a  business  license,  retail  sales  license,  or  comparable  document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household
card.

Our member renewal rate was 93% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% worldwide at the end of 2022. The majority of members renew within six
months  following  their  renewal  date.  Our  renewal  rate,  which  excludes  affiliates  of  Business  members,  is  a  trailing  calculation  that  captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date. At the end of 2020, we standardized our membership count
methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 2.0 million total
cardholders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were paid members. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. Our
membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, for which the additional fee varies. Executive members
earn  a  2%  reward  on  qualified  purchases  (generally  up  to  a  maximum  reward  of  $1,000  per  year),  redeemable  at  Costco  warehouses.  This
program also offers (except in Mexico and Korea) access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such
as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are generally provided by third parties and
vary by state and country. Executive members totaled 29.1 million and represented 57% of paid members (excluding affiliates) in the U.S. and
Canada,  and  22%  of  paid  members  (excluding  affiliates)  in  our  Other  International  operations.  The  sales  penetration  of  Executive  members
represented approximately 71% of worldwide net sales in 2022.

Human Capital

Our Code of Ethics requires that we “Take Care of Our Employees,” which is fundamental to the obligation to “Take Care of Our Members.” We
must also carefully control our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low
prices. Compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored.

Employee Base

At  the  end  of  2022,  we  employed  304,000  employees  worldwide.  The  large  majority  (approximately  95%)  is  employed  in  our  membership
warehouses and distribution channels, and less than 10% are represented by unions. We also utilize seasonal employees during peak periods.
The total number of employees by segment is:

We believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing in substantial part to the commitment and efficiency
of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective;
the  more  significant  include:  competitive  compensation  and  benefits  for  those  working  in  our  membership  warehouses  and  distributions
channels;  a  commitment  to  promoting  from  within;  and  maintaining  a  ratio  of  at  least  50%  of  our  employee  base  being  full-time  employees.
These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for the industry, a high retention rate. In 2022, in the U.S. that rate was approximately
90% for employees who have been with us for at least one year.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

The  commitment  to  “Take  Care  of  Our  Employees”  is  also  the  foundation  of  our  approach  to  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  and  creating  an
inclusive and respectful workplace. In 2022, we appointed a new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer. Embracing differences is important to the
growth of our Company. It leads to more opportunities, innovation, and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities where we do
business.

Well Being

In  October  2021,  we  provided  an  increase  of  a  minimum  of  $0.50  per  hour  for  U.S.  and  Canada  wage  scales.  In  March  2022,  we  provided
certain compensation increases, including a $0.75 per hour increase to the top of the U.S. wage scales, increased the starting wage to $17.50,
and  granted  our  employees  one  additional  day  of  paid  time  off.  In  July  2022,  we  provided  an  additional  increase  to  the  top  of  the  U.S.  wage
scales of $0.50 per hour. Costco is firmly committed to helping protect the health and safety of our members and employees and to serving our
communities. As the global effect of COVID-19 continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring the changing situation and complying with public
health guidance.

website). This report and other information on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of this Annual Report.

Competition

Our  industry  is  highly  competitive,  based  on  factors  such  as  price,  merchandise  quality  and  selection,  location,  convenience,  distribution
strategy,  and  customer  service.  We  compete  on  a  worldwide  basis  with  global,  national,  and  regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including
supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard  discounters,  department  and  specialty  stores,  and  operators  selling  a
single  category  or  narrow  range  of  merchandise.  Walmart, Target,  Kroger,  and Amazon  are  among  our  significant  general  merchandise  retail
competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club. Many of the
major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.

Intellectual Property

We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names
and  similar  intellectual  property  add  significant  value  to  our  business  and  are  important  to  our  success.  We  have  invested  significantly  in  the
development  and  protection  of  our  well-recognized  brands,  including  the  Costco  Wholesale  trademarks  and  our  private-label  brand,  Kirkland
Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help
lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration
of our private-label items.

We  rely  on  trademark  and  copyright  laws,  trade-secret  protection,  and  confidentiality,  license  and  other  agreements  with  our  suppliers,
employees  and  others  to  protect  our  intellectual  property.  The  availability  and  duration  of  trademark  registrations  vary  by  country;  however,
trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.

Available Information

Our U.S. website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports
on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments

Commission  (SEC). The  information  found  on  our  website  is  not  part  of  this  or  any  other  report  filed  with  or  furnished  to  the  SEC. The  SEC
maintains a site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file
electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.

We have a code of ethics for senior financial officers, pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available free
of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027. If the Company makes any amendments
to this code (other than technical, administrative, or non-substantive amendments) or grants any waivers, including implicit waivers, to the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or principal accounting officer and controller, we will disclose (on our website or in a Form 8-K report
filed with the SEC) the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date, and to whom it applies.

The  risks  described  below  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  We  could  also  be
affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us
or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of
this Report.

Business and Operating Risks

We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.

Our  financial  and  operational  performance  is  highly  dependent  on  our  U.S.  and  Canadian  operations,  which  comprised  87%  and  85%  of  net
sales and operating income in 2022, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 28%
of U.S. net sales in 2022. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other
domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial
results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among
other  things:  slow  growth  or  declines  in  comparable  warehouse  sales  (comparable  sales);  negative  trends  in  operating  expenses,  including
increased  labor,  healthcare  and  energy  costs;  failing  to  meet  targets  for  warehouse  openings;  cannibalizing  existing  locations  with  new
warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including
higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.

We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets,
and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our  growth  is  dependent,  in  part,  on  our  ability  to  acquire  property  and  build  or  lease  new  warehouses  and  depots.  We  compete  with  other
retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses
and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local
laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and
of  constructing,  leasing  and  operating  warehouses  and  depots.  We  also  may  have  difficulty  negotiating  leases  or  purchase  agreements  on
acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or
expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may
affect  our  ability  to  timely  build  or  lease  and  operate  new  warehouses  and  depots,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  future
growth and profitability.

We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing
warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.

We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity
with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in
the  market.  Entry  into  new  markets  may  bring  us  into  competition  with  new  competitors  or  with  existing  competitors  with  a  large,  established
market  presence.  We  cannot  ensure  that  new  warehouses  and  new  e-commerce  websites  will  be  profitable  and  future  profitability  could  be
delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.

We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and
delivery  channels.  The  effectiveness  of  these  investments  can  be  less  predictable  than  opening  new  locations  and  might  not  provide  the
anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.

Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.

Membership  loyalty  and  growth  are  essential  to  our  business. The  extent  to  which  we  achieve  growth  in  our  membership  base,  increase  the
penetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation
may  negatively  impact  comparable  sales,  diminish  member  trust,  and  reduce  renewal  rates  and,  accordingly,  net  sales  and  membership  fee
revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.

We sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these
products  is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also  generally  carry  higher  margins  than  national  brand
products  and  represent  a  growing  portion  of  our  overall  sales.  If  the  Kirkland  Signature  brand  experiences  a  loss  of  member  acceptance  or
confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.

Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and
member satisfaction.

We  depend  on  the  orderly  operation  of  the  merchandise  receiving  and  distribution  process,  primarily  through  our  depots.  We  also  rely  upon
processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.
Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme
weather  conditions  or  catastrophic  events,  labor  issues  or  other  shipping  problems  may  result  in  delays  in  the  production  and  delivery  of
merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend
heavily on third-party and in-house logistics providers and is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely
fashion.

We  may  not  timely  identify  or  effectively  respond  to  consumer  trends,  which  could  negatively  affect  our  relationship  with  our
members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.

It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our
ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing
consumer  tastes,  preferences  (including  those  relating  to  environmental,  social  and  governance  practices)  and  spending  patterns  could
negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at
predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns,
or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating
performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.

Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT
projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations.

IT  systems  play  a  crucial  role  in  conducting  our  business. These  systems  are  utilized  to  process  a  very  high  volume  of  transactions,  conduct
payment  transactions,  track  and  value  our  inventory  and  produce  reports  critical  for  making  business  decisions.  Failure  or  disruption  of  these
systems  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  ability  to  buy  products  and  services  from  our  suppliers,  produce  goods  in  our  manufacturing
plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. We are undertaking large technology and
IT transformation projects. The failure of these

10

Table of Contents

projects  could  adversely  impact  our  business  plans  and  potentially  impair  our  day  to  day  business  operations.  Given  the  high  volume  of
transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer
and  telecommunications  failures,  viruses,  internal  or  external  security  breaches,  errors  by  employees,  and  catastrophic  events  such  as  fires,
earthquakes,  tornadoes  and  hurricanes.  Any  debilitating  failure  of  our  critical  IT  systems,  data  centers  and  backup  systems  would  require
significant  investments  in  resources  to  restore  IT  services  and  may  cause  serious  impairment  in  our  business  operations  including  loss  of
business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making substantial
investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business.
Failure to deliver IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our
financial condition and results of operations.

We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and
in  compliance  with  privacy  and  data  protection  regulations  globally.  Failure  to  do  so  could  damage  our  business,  including  our
reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation
and regulatory action.

Increased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon
IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with virtually all of our business activities. Additionally, we
collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, suppliers and employees. Operating these IT systems and
networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote
work has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Threats designed to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and data, both ours
and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to
coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats. Phishing attacks have emerged as
particularly  prominent,  including  as  vectors  for  ransomware  attacks,  which  have  increased  in  breadth  and  frequency.  While  we  train  our
employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems
and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our IT systems and networks, or those managed by
third  parties  such  as  cloud  providers  or  suppliers  that  otherwise  host  confidential  information,  could  have  vulnerabilities,  which  could  go
unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the
actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems,
information or other property.

The  potential  impacts  of  a  material  cybersecurity  attack  include  reputational  damage,  litigation,  government  enforcement  actions,  penalties,
disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our
investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results
of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we
maintain and indemnification arrangements with third-parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to cybersecurity
incidents.  In  addition,  data  we  collect,  store  and  process  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  and  international  laws  and  regulations,  such  as  the
European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and
other  privacy  and  cybersecurity  laws  across  the  various  states  and  around  the  globe,  which  may  carry  significant  potential  penalties  for
noncompliance.

We are subject to payment-related risks.

We  accept  payments  using  a  variety  of  methods,  including  select  credit  and  debit  cards,  cash  and  checks,  co-brand  cardholder  rebates,
Executive  member  2%  reward  certificates,  and  our  shop  card.  As  we  offer  new  payment  options  to  our  members,  we  may  be  subject  to
additional  rules,  regulations,  compliance  requirements,  and  higher  fraud  losses.  For  certain  payment  methods,  we  pay  interchange  and  other
related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing
services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these
services to us. We are also subject to fee increases by these service providers.

We  must  comply  with  evolving  payment  card  association  and  network  operating  rules,  including  data  security  rules,  certification  requirements
and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain
compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of
individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines
and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be
adversely affected.

We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation.

If  our  merchandise,  including  food  and  prepared  food  products  for  human  consumption,  drugs,  children's  products,  pet  products  and  durable
goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members' expectations, we could experience lost
sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses
or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects,
substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or
faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure
that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to
comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause
illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product
recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is
not  fully  pursued,  negative  publicity  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  existing  and  potential  members  and  our  corporate  and  brand
image, and these effects could be long-term.

If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could
be adversely impacted.

Omnichannel  retailing  is  rapidly  evolving,  and  we  must  keep  pace  with  changing  member  expectations  and  new  developments  by  our
competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through
social  media.  We  are  making  investments  in  our  websites  and  mobile  applications.  If  we  are  unable  to  make,  improve,  or  develop  relevant
member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations,
IT,  merchandising  and  administrative  personnel.  Failure  to  identify  and  implement  a  succession  plan  for  senior  management  could  negatively
impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs
and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including the
continuing impacts of the pandemic, regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We
compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There
is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.

Claims  for  employee  health  care  benefits,  workers’  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors’  and  officers’  liability,  vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with
respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care
or  costs  to  maintain  our  insurance  or  the  failure  to  maintain  adequate  insurance  coverage  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  financial
condition and results of operations.

Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a
result  of  any  physical  damage  to,  or  the  destruction  of,  any  warehouses,  depots,  manufacturing  or  home  office  facilities,  loss  or  spoilage  of
inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.

Market and Other External Risks

We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

The  retail  business  is  highly  competitive.  We  compete  for  members,  employees,  sites,  products  and  services  and  in  other  important  respects
with  a  wide  range  of  local,  regional  and  national  wholesalers  and  retailers,  both  in  the  United  States  and  in  foreign  countries,  including  other
warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores
and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of
ways,  including  pricing,  selection  and  availability,  services,  location,  convenience,  store  hours,  and  the  attractiveness  and  ease  of  use  of
websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison
shop,  which  has  enhanced  competition.  Some  competitors  have  greater  financial  resources  and  technology  capabilities,  better  access  to
merchandise,  and  greater  market  penetration  than  we  do.  Our  inability  to  respond  effectively  to  competitive  pressures,  changes  in  the  retail
markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.

General  economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of
operations.

Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates,
unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related
to government fiscal

13

Table of Contents

and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and
other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or
ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some
of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on  (among  other  things)  the  type  of  goods,  rates  imposed,  and  timing  of  the
tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential
cost increases. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.

Prices  of  certain  commodities,  including  gasoline  and  consumable  goods  used  in  manufacturing  and  our  warehouse  retail  operations,  are
historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures,
labor  costs,  competition,  market  speculation,  government  regulations,  taxes  and  periodic  delays  in  delivery.  Rapid  and  significant  changes  in
commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could
also  increase  our  merchandise  costs  and  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses,  and  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  operations  and
financial  results.  General  economic  conditions  can  also  be  affected  by  events  like  the  outbreak  of  hostilities,  including  but  not  limited  to  the
Ukraine conflict, or acts of terrorism.

Inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If
inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various
cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we
have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment.

Suppliers  may  be  unable  to  timely  supply  us  with  quality  merchandise  at  competitive  prices  or  may  fail  to  adhere  to  our  high
standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.

We  depend  heavily  on  our  ability  to  purchase  quality  merchandise  in  sufficient  quantities  at  competitive  prices. As  the  quantities  we  require
continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to
change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of
sales and profits.

We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or
the  loss  of  key  suppliers  could  negatively  affect  us.  We  may  not  be  able  to  develop  relationships  with  new  suppliers,  and  products  from
alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which
available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.

Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities,
financial  liquidity,  natural  disasters,  extreme  weather  conditions,  public  health  emergencies,  supply  constraints  and  general  economic  and
political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere
to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude
delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and
litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.

Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.

During 2022, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 32% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our
international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare
our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars
using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of
our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we
continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.

A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency
fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates
may adversely affect our results of operations.

Natural  disasters,  extreme  weather  conditions,  public  health  emergencies  or  other  catastrophic  events  could  negatively  affect  our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Natural  disasters  and  extreme  weather  conditions,  including  those  impacted  by  climate  change,  such  as  hurricanes,  typhoons,  floods,
earthquakes,  wildfires,  droughts;  acts  of  terrorism  or  violence,  including  active  shooter  situations;  energy  shortages;  public  health  issues,
including pandemics and quarantines, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative
personnel  are  located,  could  negatively  affect  our  operations  and  financial  performance.  Such  events  could  result  in  physical  damage  to  our
properties,  limitations  on  store  operating  hours,  less  frequent  visits  by  members  to  physical  locations,  the  temporary  closure  of  warehouses,
depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or
long-term  disruption  in  the  supply  of  products  from  some  local  or  overseas  suppliers,  the  temporary  disruption  in  the  transport  of  goods  to  or
from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our
warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or
members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or
make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects.

The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and are affecting certain business operations, demand
for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our
ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.

15

Table of Contents

Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:

•
•
•
•

•
•
•

The severity and duration of the pandemic, including future mutations or related variants of the virus in areas in which we operate;
Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;
Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers;
Unknown  consequences  on  our  business  performance  and  initiatives  stemming  from  the  substantial  investment  of  time  and  other
resources to the pandemic response;
The pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides;
The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and
Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets.

To  the  extent  that  COVID-19  continues  to  adversely  affect  the  U.S.  and  global  economy,  our  business,  results  of  operations,  cash  flows,  or
financial condition, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and
expectations,  competition,  brand  reputation,  implementation  of  strategic  initiatives,  cybersecurity  threats,  payment-related  risks,  technology
systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and
regulatory requirements.

Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.

We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Government regulations limiting carbon
dioxide  and  other  greenhouse  gas  emissions  may  increase  compliance  and  merchandise  costs,  and  other  regulation  affecting  energy  inputs
could  materially  affect  our  profitability. As  the  economy  transitions  to  lower  carbon  intensity  we  cannot  guarantee  that  we  will  make  adequate
investments or successfully implement strategies that will effectively achieve our climate-related goals, which could lead to negative perceptions
among members and other stakeholders and result in reputational harm. Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts and
rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience.

We  also  sell  a  substantial  amount  of  gasoline,  the  demand  for  which  could  be  impacted  by  concerns  about  climate  change  and  increased
regulations. More stringent fuel economy standards and public policies aimed at increasing the adoption of zero-emission and alternative fuel
vehicles and other regulations related to climate change will affect our future operations and may adversely impact our profitability, and require
significant capital expenditures.

Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.

We believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in
meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member
sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price
of our stock to decline.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

We are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the
countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

At the end of 2022, we operated 260 warehouses outside of the U.S., and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future
operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which
are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations,

16

Table of Contents

policy changes such as the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we
operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions),
monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks
associated  with  having  major  facilities  in  locations  which  have  been  historically  less  stable  than  the  U.S.  Risks  inherent  in  international
operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty
in enforcing intellectual property rights.

Changes  in  accounting  standards  and  subjective  assumptions,  estimates  and  judgments  by  management  related  to  complex
accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are
relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by
our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could
significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Section  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  requires  management  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting  and  disclosure  controls  and  procedures.  If  we  are  unable  to  maintain  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  or  disclosure
controls  and  procedures,  our  ability  to  record,  process  and  report  financial  information  accurately  and  to  prepare  financial  statements  within
required  time  periods  could  be  adversely  affected,  which  could  subject  us  to  litigation  or  investigations  requiring  management  resources  and
payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.

Changes in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at
any  point  in  time,  we  may  be  under  examination  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll,  product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes.  We  may
recognize  additional  tax  expense,  be  subject  to  additional  tax  liabilities,  or  incur  losses  and  penalties,  due  to  changes  in  laws,  regulations,
administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We
compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change
in  earnings  attributable  to  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  could  result  in  an  unfavorable  change  in  our  overall  tax  provision.
Additionally,  changes  in  the  enacted  tax  rates  or  adverse  outcomes  in  tax  audits,  including  transfer  pricing  disputes,  could  have  a  material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Significant  changes  in  or  failure  to  comply  with  regulations  relating  to  the  use,  storage,  discharge  and  disposal  of  hazardous
materials,  hazardous  and  non-hazardous  wastes  and  other  environmental  matters  could  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

We are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use,
storage,  discharge  and  disposal  of  hazardous  materials,  hazardous  and  non-hazardous  wastes  and  other  environmental  matters.  Failure  to
comply  with  these  laws  could  result  in  harm  to  our  members,  employees  or  others,  significant  costs  to  satisfy  environmental  compliance,
remediation  or  compensatory  requirements,  or  the  imposition  of  severe  penalties  or  restrictions  on  operations  by  governmental  agencies  or
courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Operations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use
and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized
processing  equipment,  and  other  operations  that  potentially  could  affect  the  environment  and  public  health  and  safety.  Failure  to  comply  with
current  and  future  environmental,  health  and  safety  standards  could  result  in  the  imposition  of  fines  and  penalties,  illness  or  injury  of  our
employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities.

We  are  involved  in  a  number  of  legal  proceedings  and  audits  and  some  of  these  outcomes  could  adversely  affect  our  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our  business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations.  Failure  to  achieve  compliance  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits  and  other
proceedings,  and  lead  to  damage  awards,  fines,  penalties,  and  remediation  costs.  We  are  or  may  become  involved  in  a  number  of  legal
proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed
property  laws,  and  other  litigation.  We  cannot  predict  with  certainty  the  outcomes  of  these  proceedings  and  other  contingencies,  including
environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits,
unclaimed  property  laws,  and  other  contingencies  could  require  us  to  take,  or  refrain  from  taking,  actions  which  could  negatively  affect  our
operations  or  could  require  us  to  pay  substantial  amounts  of  money,  adversely  affecting  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.
Additionally,  defending  against  these  lawsuits  and  proceedings  may  involve  significant  expense  and  diversion  of  management's  attention  and
resources.

Item  7—Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Conditions  and  Results  of  Operations  (amounts  in  millions,  except  per
share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)

The  following  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  (MD&A)  is  intended  to  promote
understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with,
our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  (Part  II,  Item  8  of  this  Form  10-K).  This  section
generally  discusses  the  results  of  operations  for  2022  compared  to  2021.  For  discussion  related  to  the  results  of  operations  and  changes  in
financial condition for 2021 compared to 2020 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October
6, 2021.

Overview

We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core
merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing
aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). We define comparable sales as net sales from
warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating
for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the
amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our
control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and
associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses,
reducing  them  as  a  percentage  of  sales  and  enhancing  profitability.  Generating  comparable  sales  growth  is  foremost  a  question  of  making
available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.
Another  substantial  factor  in  net  sales  growth  is  the  health  of  the  economies  in  which  we  do  business,  including  the  effects  of  inflation  or
deflation,  especially  the  United  States.  Net  sales  growth  and  gross  margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and
widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While
we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in
adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration
of our private-label items, and through online offerings.

Our  philosophy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  quality  goods  and  services  at  competitive  prices.  We  do  not  focus  in  the  short-term  on
maximizing  prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  –
consistently providing the most competitive values. Merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced
in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to
cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-
usual  purchasing  and  in  greater  volumes,  offering  seasonal  merchandise  outside  its  season,  as  well  as  passing  cost  increases  on  to  our
members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding
prices  steady  despite  cost  increases  instead  of  passing  the  increases  on  to  our  members,  all  negatively  impacting  gross  margin  and  gross
margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).

We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-
gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of
gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-

22

Table of Contents

term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross
margin  percentage  but  decreases  our  SG&A  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales.  A  decline  in  gasoline  prices  has  the  inverse  effect.
Additionally,  actions  in  various  countries,  particularly  China  and  the  United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The
degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on  (among  other  things)  the  type  of  goods,  rates  imposed,  and  timing  of  the  tariffs.  Higher  tariffs  could
adversely impact our results.

We  also  achieve  net  sales  growth  by  opening  new  warehouses. As  our  warehouse  base  grows,  available  and  desirable  sites  become  more
difficult  to  secure,  and  square  footage  growth  becomes  a  comparatively  less  substantial  component  of  growth. The  negative  aspects  of  such
growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses
when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of
square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-
commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage
relative to our warehouse operations. E-commerce sales growth slowed in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.

The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce
member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of
our  Executive  members,  and  sustain  high  renewal  rates  materially  influences  our  profitability.  Our  paid  membership  growth  rate  may  be
adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.

Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant
costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With  respect  to  the  compensation  of  our  employees,  our
philosophy  is  not  to  seek  to  minimize  their  wages  and  benefits.  Rather,  we  believe  that  achieving  our  longer-term  objectives  of  reducing
employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for
much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces.
Because  our  business  operates  on  very  low  margins,  modest  changes  in  various  items  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income,  particularly
merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.

Our  operating  model  is  generally  the  same  across  our  U.S.,  Canadian,  and  Other  International  operating  segments  (see  Note  11  to  the
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher
rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or
lack e-commerce or business delivery.

In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are
the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies
into  U.S.  dollars.  This  impact  of  foreign-exchange  rate  changes  is  calculated  based  on  the  difference  between  the  current  period's  currency
exchange  rates  and  that  of  the  comparable  prior  period.  The  impact  of  changes  in  gasoline  prices  on  net  sales  is  calculated  based  on  the
difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.

Our  fiscal  year  ends  on  the  Sunday  closest  to  August  31.  References  to  2022,  2021,  and  2020  relate  to  the  52-week  fiscal  years  ended
August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to
rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.

COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business during 2022, albeit to a lesser extent. COVID-related and other supply and logistics
constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. During 2021,
we paid $515 in incremental wages related to COVID-19, which ceased in February 2021.

Net sales increased $30,678 or 16% during 2022. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 14%, and sales at
new warehouses opened in 2021 and 2022. Sales increased $15,830 in core merchandise categories and $14,848 in warehouse ancillary and
other businesses. The rate of increase was strongest in our gasoline, business centers, and travel businesses. Sales continued to be impacted
by inflation, higher than what we experienced in previous fiscal years.

During 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $9,230, 481 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 42% increase in the
average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 22%, positively impacting net sales by $3,847, 200 basis points.
Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,762, 92 basis points, compared to
2021, attributable primarily to our Other International operations.

Comparable Sales

Comparable  sales  increased  14%  during  2022  and  were  positively  impacted  by  increases  in  shopping  frequency  and  average  ticket,  which
includes the effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency. E-commerce comparable sales increased 10% during 2022, including inflation.

Membership fee revenue increased 9% in 2022, driven by new member sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership. Changes in foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by $42, compared to 2021. At the end of 2022, our member renewal
rates  were  93%  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada  and  90%  worldwide.  Renewal  rates  continue  to  benefit  from  more  members  auto  renewing  and
increased penetration of Executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business
members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. We account for
membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period.

Total gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross
margin  was  10.94%,  a  decrease  of  19  basis  points.  This  was  primarily  due  to  a  33  basis-point  decrease  in  core  merchandise  categories,
predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise
costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by one basis point due to increased 2% rewards. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses
positively  impacted  gross  margin  by  29  basis  points,  predominantly  gasoline,  partially  offset  by  e-commerce.  Gross  margin  was  positively
impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the negative impact of a one-time
charge related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively
impacted gross margin by approximately $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations.

The  gross  margin  in  core  merchandise  categories,  when  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  core  merchandise  sales  (rather  than  total  net  sales),
decreased  27  basis  points.  The  decrease  was  across  all  categories,  most  significantly  in  fresh  foods.  This  measure  eliminates  the  impact  of
changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.

Gross  margin  on  a  segment  basis,  when  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  segment's  own  sales  and  excluding  the  impact  of  changes  in
gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. All segments were negatively impacted due to
decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin in our U.S.
segment was also negatively impacted by the LIFO charge. Our Other International segment was negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards.
All segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to COVID-19.

operating costs were lower by five basis points, and stock compensation expense was lower by one basis point. Changes in foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately $148, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International
operations.

The  increase  in  interest  income  in  2022  was  primarily  due  to  higher  global  interest  rates.  Foreign-currency  transaction  gains,  net,  include
revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations and mark-to-market adjustments
for  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts.  See  Derivatives  and  Foreign  Currency  sections  in  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements

The  effective  tax  rate  for  2022  was  impacted  by  net  discrete  tax  benefits  of  $130.  This  included  $94  of  excess  tax  benefits  related  to  stock
compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.2% for 2022.

The  effective  tax  rate  for  2021  was  impacted  by  net  discrete  tax  benefits  of  $163.  This  included  $75  of  excess  tax  benefits  related  to  stock
compensation, $70 related to the special cash dividend paid through our 401(k) plan, and $19 related to a reduction in the valuation allowance
against certain deferred tax assets. Excluding net discrete tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for 2021.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

(3,891)
(1,147)

Our  primary  sources  of  liquidity  are  cash  flows  generated  from  our  operations,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term  investments.  Cash
and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  were  $11,049  and  $12,175  at  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  Of  these  balances,
unsettled  credit  and  debit  card  receivables  represented  approximately  $2,010  and  $1,816  at  the  end  of  2022  and  2021.  These  receivables
generally  settle  within  four  days.  Changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  impacted  cash  and  cash  equivalents  negatively  by  $249  in  2022,  and
positively by $46 and $70 in 2021 and 2020.

Material  contractual  obligations  arising  in  the  normal  course  of  business  primarily  consist  of  purchase  obligations,  long-term  debt  and  related
interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included
in Item 8 of this Report for amounts outstanding on August 28, 2022, related to debt and leases.

Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in
the next 12 months. Construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new
and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months.

Management  believes  that  our  cash  and  investment  position  and  operating  cash  flows  with  capacity  under  existing  and  available  credit
agreements  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  liquidity  and  capital  requirements  for  the  foreseeable  future.  We  believe  that  our  U.S.  current  and
projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $7,392 in 2022, compared to $8,958 in 2021. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily
from  net  sales  and  membership  fees.  Cash  flow  used  in  operations  generally  consists  of  payments  to  merchandise  suppliers,  warehouse
operating  costs,  including  payroll  and  employee  benefits,  utilities,  and  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees.  Cash  used  in  operations  also
includes  payments  for  income  taxes.  Changes  in  our  net  investment  in  merchandise  inventories  (the  difference  between  merchandise
inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by

28

Table of Contents

several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our
suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,915 in 2022, compared to $3,535 in 2021, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net
cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.

Capital Expenditures

Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required
for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2022, we spent $3,891 on
capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,800 to $4,000 during fiscal 2023. These expenditures are expected
to  be  financed  with  cash  from  operations,  existing  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term  investments.  We  opened  26  new  warehouses,
including  three  relocations,  in  2022,  and  plan  to  open  approximately  up  to  29  additional  new  warehouses,  including  four  relocations,  in  2023.
There  can  be  no  assurance  that  current  expectations  will  be  realized,  and  plans  are  subject  to  change  upon  further  review  of  our  capital
expenditure needs or based on the economic environment.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities totaled $4,283 in 2022, compared to $6,488 in 2021. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related
to  the  payment  of  dividends,  payments  to  our  former  joint-venture  partner  for  a  dividend  and  the  purchase  of  their  equity  interest  in  Taiwan,
totaling  $1,050  in  the  aggregate,  repayments  of  our  2.300%  Senior  Notes,  repurchases  of  common  stock,  and  withholding  taxes  on  stock
awards.

Stock Repurchase Programs

During  2022  and  2021,  we  repurchased  863,000  and  1,358,000  shares  of  common  stock,  at  average  prices  of  $511.46  and  $364.39,
respectively,  totaling  approximately  $442  and  $495,  respectively.  These  amounts  may  differ  from  the  stock  repurchase  balances  in  the
accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases
are  made  from  time-to-time,  as  conditions  warrant,  in  the  open  market  or  in  block  purchases  and  pursuant  to  plans  under  SEC  Rule  10b5-1.
Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased
under our approved plan was $2,808 at the end of 2022.

Dividends

Cash  dividends  declared  in  2022  totaled  $3.38  per  share,  as  compared  to  $12.98  per  share  in  2021.  Dividends  in  2021  included  a  special
dividend of $10.00 per share, aggregating approximately $4,430. In April 2022, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from
$0.79 to $0.90 per share.

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs

We  maintain  bank  credit  facilities  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes. At August  28,  2022,  we  had  borrowing  capacity  under
these facilities of $1,257. Our international operations maintain $773 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $176 is guaranteed by
the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were $88 and $41 at the end of 2022 and 2021.

The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $224. The outstanding commitments under these
facilities at the end of 2022 totaled $184, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year.
The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these

29

Table of Contents

facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial
letters of credit outstanding.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or
future effect on our financial condition or financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires
that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our
estimates  on  historical  experience  and  on  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable,  and  we  continue  to  review  and  evaluate  these
estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Report.

Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities

Claims  for  employee  health-care  benefits,  workers’  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors’  and  officers’  liability,  vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to  seek  to  limit  exposures  arising  from  very  large  losses.  We  use  different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive
insurance  subsidiary,  and  participate  in  a  reinsurance  program.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  we  retain  are  not  discounted  and  are
estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are
highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims. While
we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs
could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.

Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)

Our  exposure  to  financial  market  risk  results  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  engage  in
speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

Our  exposure  to  market  risk  for  changes  in  interest  rates  relates  primarily  to  our  investment  holdings  that  are  diversified  among  various
instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as
well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date
of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our
short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.

30

Table of Contents

Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by
U.S.  government  and  government  agency  obligations,  U.S.  government  and  government  agency  money  market  funds,  and  insured  bank
balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government
and  government  agency  money  market  funds.  Our  Canadian  and  Other  International  subsidiaries’  investments  are  primarily  in  money  market
funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.

A  100  basis  point  change  in  interest  rates  as  of  the  end  of  2022  would  have  had  an  immaterial  incremental  change  in  fair  market  value.  For
those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest
rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.

The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end
of 2022, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,590. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See
Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our  foreign  subsidiaries  conduct  certain  transactions  in  non-functional  currencies,  which  exposes  us  to  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates.  We
manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these
fluctuations  on  known  future  expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  are  intended  primarily  to
economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk
with  the  use  of  these  contracts  and  do  not  intend  to  engage  in  speculative  transactions.  For  additional  information  related  to  the  Company's
forward foreign-exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical
10%  strengthening  of  the  functional  currency  compared  to  the  non-functional  currency  exchange  rates  at  August  28,  2022,  would  have
decreased  the  fair  value  of  the  contracts  by  $128  and  resulted  in  an  unrealized  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income  for  the  same
amount.

Commodity Price Risk

We  are  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  prices  for  energy,  particularly  electricity  and  natural  gas,  and  other  commodities  used  in  retail  and
manufacturing  operations,  which  we  seek  to  partially  mitigate  through  fixed-price  contracts  for  certain  of  our  warehouses  and  other  facilities,
predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition
to  some  of  the  fuel  for  our  gas  stations,  on  an  index  basis.  These  contracts  meet  the  characteristics  of  derivative  instruments,  but  generally
qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

Costco Wholesale Corporation:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  subsidiaries  (the  Company)  as  of
August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each
of  the  52-week  periods  ended August  28,  2022, August  29,  2021,  and August  30,  2020,  and  the  related  notes  (collectively,  the  consolidated
financial  statements).  In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the
Company as of August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended
August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  August  28,  2022,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 4, 2022,
expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These  consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our
audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of workers' compensation self-insurance liabilities

As  discussed  in  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  estimates  its  self-insurance  liabilities  by  considering
historical  claims  experience,  demographic  factors,  severity  factors,  and  other  actuarial  assumptions.  The  estimated  self-insurance
liabilities as of August 28, 2022, were $1,364 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the
United States operations.

We  identified  the  evaluation  of  the  Company’s  workers’  compensation  self-insurance  liabilities  for  the  United  States  operations  as  a
critical  audit  matter  because  of  the  extent  of  specialized  skill  and  knowledge  needed  to  evaluate  the  underlying  assumptions  and
judgments  made  by  the  Company  in  the  actuarial  models.  Specifically,  subjective  auditor  judgment  was  required  to  evaluate  the
Company's selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the actuarial models.

The  following  are  the  primary  procedures  we  performed  to  address  this  critical  audit  matter.  We  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the
operating  effectiveness  of  certain  internal  controls  over  the  Company’s  self-insurance  workers'  compensation  process.  This  included
controls  related  to  the  development  and  selection  of  the  assumptions  listed  above  used  in  the  actuarial  calculation  and  review  of  the
actuarial report. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:

•

•

•

Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards

Evaluating  the  Company’s  ability  to  estimate  self-insurance  workers'  compensation  liabilities  by  comparing  its  historical
estimates with actual incurred losses and paid losses

Evaluating  the  above  listed  assumptions  underlying  the  Company’s  actuarial  estimates  by  developing  an  independent
expectation  of  the  self-insurance  workers'  compensation  liabilities  and  comparing  them  to  the  amounts  recorded  by  the
Company

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

Costco Wholesale Corporation:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022, based
on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 28, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
equity,  and  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  52-week  periods  ended  August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and  August  30,  2020,  and  the  related  notes
(collectively,  the  consolidated  financial  statements),  and  our  report  dated  October  4,  2022,  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  those  consolidated
financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all  material  respects.  Our  audit  of  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material
weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  Our  audit  also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles. A  company’s  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,
accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  (Costco  or  the  Company),  a  Washington  corporation,  and  its  subsidiaries  operate  membership  warehouses
based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of
merchandise  categories  will  produce  high  sales  volumes  and  rapid  inventory  turnover. At August  28,  2022,  Costco  operated  838  warehouses
worldwide: 578 in the United States (U.S.) located in 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 31 in Japan,
29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 17 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, four in Spain, two each in France and China, and one in Iceland. The
Company operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.

Basis of Presentation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Costco,  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  and  subsidiaries  in  which  it  has  a
controlling  interest.  The  Company  reports  noncontrolling  interests  in  consolidated  entities  as  a  component  of  equity  separate  from  the
Company’s  equity.  All  material  inter-company  transactions  between  and  among  the  Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  been
eliminated in consolidation. During 2022, the Company paid a cash dividend of $208 and purchased the equity interest of its Taiwan operations
from its former joint-venture partner for $842, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate. The remaining noncontrolling interest represents the portion of
equity interests in a consolidated joint venture that is not 100% owned by the Company. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate
to net income attributable to Costco.

Fiscal Year End

The Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021,
and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, August 29, 2021, and August 30, 2020, respectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and
assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from
those estimates and assumptions.

Reclassification

Reclassifications were made to our 2021 and 2020 consolidated statements of income and cash flows to conform with current year presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at
the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card
receivables were $2,010 and $1,816 at the end of 2022 and 2021.

41

Table of Contents

The Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end
of  2022  and  2021,  are  $995  and  $999  representing  the  excess  of  outstanding  payments  over  cash  on  deposit  at  the  banks  on  which  the
payments were drawn.

Short-Term Investments

Short-term  investments  generally  consist  of  debt  securities  (U.S.  Government  and Agency  Notes),  with  maturities  at  the  date  of  purchase  of
three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-
term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term
investments  classified  as  available-for-sale  are  recorded  at  fair  value  using  the  specific  identification  method  with  the  unrealized  gains  and
losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale
securities,  if  any,  are  determined  on  a  specific  identification  basis  and  are  recorded  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the  consolidated
statements  of  income.  These  available-for-sale  investments  have  a  low  level  of  inherent  credit  risk  given  they  are  issued  by  the  U.S.
Government  and Agencies.  Changes  in  their  fair  value  are  primarily  attributable  to  changes  in  interest  rates  and  market  liquidity.  Short-term
investments  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are  financial  instruments  that  the  Company  has  the  intent  and  ability  to  hold  to  maturity  and  are
reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis.

The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative
criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and
other, net in the consolidated statements of income.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash
and  cash  equivalents,  receivables  and  accounts  payable,  approximate  fair  value  due  to  their  short-term  nature  or  variable  interest  rates.  See
Notes 2, 3, and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants  at  the  measurement  date.  Fair  value  is  estimated  by  applying  a  fair  value  hierarchy,  which  requires  maximizing  the  use  of
observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market

data.

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as
quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all
other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety
of  independent  external  valuation  information  providers,  including  trades,  bid  price  or  spread,  two-sided  markets,  quotes,  benchmark  curves
including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market
data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports
transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair

42

Table of Contents

value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.

Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term
debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs,
and  are  being  amortized  to  interest  expense  over  the  term  of  the  loan.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  the  Company's  long-term  debt  is  based
primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit.

Receivables, Net

Receivables  consist  primarily  of  vendor,  credit  card  incentive,  reinsurance,  third-party  pharmacy  and  other  receivables.  Vendor  receivables
include discounts and volume rebates. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain
circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a
net basis. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangements in the U.S. and
Canada. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded
through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the
consolidated  balance  sheets.  Third-party  pharmacy  receivables  generally  relate  to  amounts  due  from  members’  insurers.  Other  receivables
primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.

The valuation allowance related to receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting,
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely
matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of
inflation  or  deflation,  and  these  estimates  are  adjusted  to  actual  results  determined  at  year-end,  after  actual  inflation  or  deflation  rates  and
inventory  levels  have  been  determined.  Due  to  inflation,  a  $438  charge  was  recorded  during  2022  to  merchandise  costs  to  increase  the
cumulative  LIFO  valuation  on  merchandise  inventories  at August  28,  2022. An  immaterial  LIFO  charge  was  recorded  in  2021.  Canadian  and
Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis.

The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision is
adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where
appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided
that they are probable and reasonably estimable.

43

Table of Contents

Property and Equipment, Net

Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  Depreciation  and  amortization  expense  is  computed  primarily  using  the  straight-line  method  over
estimated  useful  lives.  Leasehold  improvements  made  after  the  beginning  of  the  initial  lease  term  are  depreciated  over  the  shorter  of  the
estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold
improvements are made.

The Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development,
these costs are included in construction in progress. To the extent that the assets become ready for their intended use, these costs are included
in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. In 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized in
SG&A expenses write-offs of $118 and $84 for certain information technology assets.

Repair  and  maintenance  costs  are  expensed  when  incurred.  Expenditures  for  remodels,  refurbishments  and  improvements  that  add  to  or
change  asset  function  or  useful  life  are  capitalized.  Assets  removed  during  the  remodel,  refurbishment  or  improvement  are  retired.  Assets
classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2022 and 2021 were immaterial.

The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances at the end of 2022 and 2021:

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in
circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset
groups  held  and  used,  including  warehouses  to  be  relocated,  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  group  is  considered  recoverable  when  the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying
value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and
used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale
(disposal  group),  the  carrying  value  is  compared  to  the  disposal  group’s  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.  The  Company  estimates  fair  value  by
obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2022
or 2020. Impairment charges recognized in 2021 were immaterial.

Leases

The  Company  leases  land,  buildings,  and/or  equipment  at  warehouses  and  certain  other  office  and  distribution  facilities.  Leases  generally
contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined
number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market
value; or (c) a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer.

44

Table of Contents

Some leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease
and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain
leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Our leases do
not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

The  Company  determines  at  inception  whether  a  contract  is  or  contains  a  lease.  Non-lease  components  and  the  lease  components  to  which
they  relate  are  accounted  for  together  as  a  single  lease  component  for  all  asset  classes.  The  Company  initially  records  right-of-use  (ROU)
assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The
lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will
exercise the option. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments
is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the
Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted
interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as
described in Property and Equipment, net above.

The  Company's  asset  retirement  obligations  (ARO)  primarily  relate  to  leasehold  improvements  that  must  be  removed  at  the  end  of  a  lease.
These  obligations  are  generally  recorded  as  a  discounted  liability,  with  an  offsetting  asset  at  the  inception  of  the  lease  term,  based  upon  the
estimated  fair  value  of  the  costs  to  remove  the  improvements.  These  liabilities  are  accreted  over  time  to  the  projected  future  value  of  the
obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included with
buildings  and  improvements.  Estimated  ARO  liabilities  associated  with  these  leases  are  included  in  other  liabilities  in  the  accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.

Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews  goodwill  annually  in  the  fourth  quarter  for  impairment  or  when  circumstances  indicate  carrying  value  may  exceed  the  fair  value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than  carrying  value,  a  quantitative  analysis  is  completed  using  either  the  income  or  market  approach,  or  a  combination  of  both.  The  income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.

Goodwill  is  included  in  other  long-term  assets  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  following  table  summarizes  goodwill  by  reportable

Definite-lived  intangible  assets,  which  are  not  material,  are  included  in  other  long-term  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.

Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities

Claims  for  employee  health  care  benefits,  workers’  compensation,  general  liability,  property  damage,  directors’  and  officers’  liability,  vehicle
liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks
to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive
insurance  subsidiary  (the  captive)  and  participates  in  a  reinsurance  program.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  are  retained  by  the
Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and
other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from
these  assumptions  and  historical  trends. At  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  these  insurance  liabilities  were  $1,364  and  $1,257  in  the  aggregate,
respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based
on their nature.

The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses,
in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  The  captive  participates  in  a  reinsurance  program  that  includes  other  third-party  participants.  The
reinsurance  agreement  is  one  year  in  duration,  and  new  agreements  are  entered  into  by  each  participant  at  their  discretion  at  the
commencement  of  the  next  calendar  year.  The  participant  agreements  and  practices  of  the  reinsurance  program  are  designed  to  limit  a
participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated
balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains
its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part,
through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known
future  expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventory
expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts
do  not  qualify  for  derivative  hedge  accounting.  The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  risk  with  the  use  of  these  contracts  and  does  not  intend  to
engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding
contracts  upon  certain  triggering  events. The  aggregate  fair  value  amounts  of  derivative  instruments  in  a  net  liability  position  and  the  amount
needed  to  settle  the  instruments  immediately  if  the  credit-risk-related  contingent  features  were  triggered  were  immaterial  at  the  end  of  2022.
There were no derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward
foreign-exchange contracts were $1,242 and $1,331 at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of
unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2022 and 2021.

The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to
the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail
and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other
facilities,  primarily  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada.  The  Company  also  enters  into  variable-priced  contracts  for  some  purchases  of  natural  gas,  in
addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of

46

Table of Contents

derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no
mark-to-market adjustment.

Foreign Currency

The  functional  currencies  of  the  Company’s  international  subsidiaries  are  their  local  currencies.  Assets  and  liabilities  recorded  in  foreign
currencies  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  on  the  balance  sheet  date.  Translation  adjustments  are  recorded  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company’s  consolidated  foreign  operations  are  translated  at  average  exchange  rates
prevailing during the year.

The  Company  recognizes  foreign-currency  transaction  gains  and  losses  related  to  revaluing  or  settling  monetary  assets  and  liabilities
denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.
Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their
functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These
items were $84 in 2022 and immaterial in 2021 and 2020.

Revenue Recognition

The  Company  recognizes  sales  for  the  amount  of  consideration  collected  from  the  member,  which  includes  gross  shipping  fees  where
applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated
returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a
gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the
consolidated balance sheets.

The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods. The Company
also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise
sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the
member.  For  merchandise  shipped  directly  to  the  member,  shipping  and  handling  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  as  fulfillment  costs  and
included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member
picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it
has  control  of  the  merchandise  or  service  before  it  is  transferred  to  the  member,  which  generally  is  established  when  Costco  is  primarily
responsible  for  merchandising  decisions,  pricing  discretion,  and  maintains  the  relationship  with  the  member,  including  assurance  of  member
service and satisfaction.

The  Company  accounts  for  membership  fee  revenue,  net  of  refunds,  on  a  deferred  basis,  ratably  over  the  one-year  membership  period.
Deferred membership fees at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $2,174 and $2,042, respectively.

In  most  countries,  the  Company's  Executive  members  qualify  for  a  2%  reward  on  qualified  purchases,  subject  to  an  annual  maximum  value,
which  does  not  expire  and  is  redeemable  at  Costco  warehouses.  The  Company  accounts  for  this  reward  as  a  reduction  in  sales,  net  of  the
estimated  impact  of  non-redemptions  (breakage),  with  the  corresponding  liability  classified  as  accrued  member  rewards  in  the  consolidated
balance  sheets.  Estimated  breakage  is  computed  based  on  redemption  data.  For  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  the  net  reduction  in  sales
was $2,307, $2,047, and $1,707 respectively.

47

Table of Contents

The  Company  sells  and  otherwise  provides  proprietary  shop  cards  that  do  not  expire  and  are  redeemable  at  the  warehouse  or  online  for
merchandise  or  membership.  Revenue  from  shop  cards  is  recognized  upon  redemption,  and  estimated  breakage  is  recognized  based  on
redemption  data.  The  Company  accounts  for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Shop  card
liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Citibank, N.A. became the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members in June 2016. The Company receives various forms of
consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the
rebate that cardholders receive, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are
issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other
International subsidiaries.

Merchandise Costs

Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs
related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced
by  vendor  consideration.  Merchandise  costs  also  include  salaries,  benefits,  depreciation,  and  utilities  in  fresh  foods  and  certain  ancillary
departments.

Vendor Consideration

The Company has agreements to receive funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by
signed  agreements  that  are  reflected  in  the  carrying  value  of  the  inventory  when  earned  or  as  the  Company  progresses  towards  earning  the
rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a
reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees
(other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home
office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment
depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, preopening, as well as other operating costs incurred
to support warehouse and e-commerce website operations.

Retirement Plans

The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The
plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each
eligible  participant  an  annual  discretionary  contribution.  The  Company  also  has  a  defined  contribution  plan  for  employees  in  Canada  and
contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit
and defined contribution plans, which are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $824, $748, and $676 for 2022, 2021, and 2020,
and are predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

Stock-Based Compensation

Restricted  Stock  Units  (RSUs)  granted  to  employees  generally  vest  over  five  years  and  allow  for  quarterly  vesting  of  the  pro-rata  number  of
stock-based  awards  that  would  vest  on  the  next  anniversary  of  the  grant  date  in  the  event  of  retirement  or  voluntary  termination.  Actual
forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

48

Table of Contents

Compensation expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for
the entire award. Awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting based on cumulative years of service with
the  Company.  Compensation  expense  for  the  accelerated  shares  is  recognized  upon  achievement  of  the  long-service  term.  The  cumulative
amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at
that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the
expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.

Stock-based  compensation  expense  is  predominantly  included  in  SG&A  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Certain  stock-
based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company’s stock-
based compensation plans.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable  income  in  the  years  in  which  those  temporary  differences  and  carry-forwards  are  expected  to  be  recovered  or  settled.  The  effect  on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.

The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment.
The  benefits  of  uncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements  only  after  determining  a  more-likely-
than-not  probability  that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstances  change,  the
Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate.

Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco

The  computation  of  basic  net  income  per  share  uses  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  that  were  outstanding  during  the  period.  The
computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the
number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock
method for shares subject to RSUs.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased
shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital
and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding
and  is  applied  to  the  number  of  shares  repurchased.  Any  remaining  amount  is  allocated  to  retained  earnings.  See  Note  6  for  additional
information.

At August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021, the Company did not hold any Level 1 or 3 financial assets or liabilities that were measured at fair
value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between levels during 2022 or 2021.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Assets  and  liabilities  recognized  and  disclosed  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  include  items  such  as  financial  assets  measured  at
amortized  cost  and  long-lived  nonfinancial  assets.  These  assets  are  measured  at  fair  value  if  determined  to  be  impaired.  There  were  no  fair
value adjustments to nonfinancial assets during 2022 and in 2021 they were immaterial.

Note 4—Debt

Short-Term Borrowings

The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,257 and $1,050, in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Borrowings  on  these  short-term  facilities  were  immaterial  during  2022  and  2021.  Short-term  borrowings  outstanding  were  $88  and  $41  at  the
end of 2022 and 2021.

Long-Term Debt

The  Company's  long-term  debt  consists  primarily  of  Senior  Notes,  described  below.  On  December  1,  2021,  the  Company  repaid,  prior  to
maturity, the 2.300% Senior Notes at a redemption price plus accrued interest as specified in the Notes' agreement.

The  Company  at  its  option  may  redeem  the  Senior  Notes  at  any  time,  in  whole  or  in  part,  at  a  redemption  price  plus  accrued  interest.  The
redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of
principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, the holder has the right to require the Company to purchase this security at a
price  of  101%  of  the  principal  amount  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  to  the  date  of  the  event.  Interest  on  all  outstanding  long-term  debt  is
payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.

Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs.

At  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  the  fair  value  of  the  Company's  long-term  debt,  including  the  current  portion,  was  approximately  $6,033  and

These amounts may differ from repurchases of common stock in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock
repurchases  at  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  Purchases  are  made  from  time  to  time,  as  conditions  warrant,  in  the  open  market  or  in  block
purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1.

Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to executive officers are generally
performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented
by  the  Company.  RSUs  are  subject  to  quarterly  vesting  upon  retirement  or  voluntary  termination.  Employees  who  attain  at  least  25  years  of
service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized
the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant
and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The
Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually,
net of shares withheld for taxes.

Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity

RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five and three years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the
RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained 25 or
more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and
undelivered shares. At the end of 2022, 10,445,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan.

The following awards were outstanding at the end of 2022:

•
•

3,328,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
121,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 82,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2022. This determination occurred in September 2022, at which time at least 33% of the units vested, as a result
of the long service of all executive officers receiving performance-based RSUs. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment
over specified periods of time.

remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2022 was $758 and the weighted-average period of time
over which this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2022 were approximately 1,210,000 RSUs
vested but not yet delivered.

The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2022 and 2021 include deferred income tax assets of $445 and $444, respectively, included in other
long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $724 and $754, respectively, included in other long-term liabilities.

In 2022 and 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of $313 and $214, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.

The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries after 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested
(other than China and Taiwan) and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and
state  income  taxes  payable  assuming  a  hypothetical  repatriation  to  the  U.S.  The  Company  continues  to  consider  undistributed  earnings  of
certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $2,779, to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2022 and 2021 is as follows:

The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing  of  such  deductibility. At  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  these  amounts  were  immaterial.  Because  of  the  impact  of  deferred  tax  accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $15 and $30 at the end of 2022 and 2021.

Accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  income  tax  matters  are  classified  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense.  Accrued  interest  and
penalties recognized during 2022 and 2021, and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material.

The  Company  is  currently  under  audit  by  several  jurisdictions  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  Some  audits  may  conclude  in  the  next  12
months,  and  the  unrecognized  tax  benefits  recorded  in  relation  to  the  audits  may  differ  from  actual  settlement  amounts.  It  is  not  practical  to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with  the  audits.  The  Company  does  not  anticipate  that  there  will  be  a  material  increase  or  decrease  in  the  total  amount  of  unrecognized  tax
benefits in the next 12 months.

The  Company  files  income  tax  returns  in  the  United  States,  various  state  and  local  jurisdictions,  in  Canada,  and  in  several  other  foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.

Other Taxes

The  Company  is  subject  to  multiple  examinations  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll,  product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes  in  various
jurisdictions.  In  certain  cases,  the  Company  has  received  assessments  from  the  authorities.  Possible  losses  or  range  of  possible  losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.

The  Company  is  involved  in  a  number  of  claims,  proceedings  and  litigations  arising  from  its  business  and  property  ownership.  In  accordance
with  applicable  accounting  guidance,  the  Company  establishes  an  accrual  for  legal  proceedings  if  and  when  those  matters  present  loss
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of amounts accrued. The Company
monitors  those  matters  for  developments  that  would  affect  the  likelihood  of  a  loss  (taking  into  account  where  applicable  indemnification
arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company
has  recorded  immaterial  accruals  with  respect  to  certain  matters  described  below,  in  addition  to  other  immaterial  accruals  for  matters  not
described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but
will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case,
there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual
has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably
estimated  because,  among  other  things:  (i)  the  remedies  or  penalties  sought  are  indeterminate  or  unspecified;  (ii)  the  legal  and/or  factual
theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.

The  Company  is  a  defendant  in  an  action  commenced  in  July  2013  under  the  California  Labor  Code  Private Attorneys  General Act  (PAGA)
alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to employees who work at entrance and exit doors in California
warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2013-1-CV-248813; Santa Clara Superior Court). The complaint seeks relief under
the  California  Labor  Code,  including  civil  penalties  and  attorneys’  fees. The  Company  filed  an  answer  denying  the  material  allegations  of  the
complaint. A bench trial was held in June and July; no decision has been issued.

In June 2022, a business center employee raised similar claims alleging failure to provide seating to employees who work at membership refund
desks in California warehouses and business centers. Rodriguez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22CV012847; Alameda Superior Court).
The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer denying
the material allegations of the complaint.

In  December  2018,  a  depot  employee  raised  similar  claims,  alleging  that  depot  employees  in  California  did  not  receive  suitable  seating  or
reasonably  comfortable  workplace  temperature  conditions.  Lane  v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Case  No.  CIVDS  1908816;  San  Bernardino
Superior  Court).  The  Company  filed  an  answer  denying  the  material  allegations  of  the  complaint.  In  October  2019,  the  parties  settled  for  an
immaterial amount the seating claims on a representative basis, which received court approval in

60

Table of Contents

February 2020. The parties settled the temperature claims for an immaterial amount in April 2022, and court approval was received in May 2022.

In March 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide
meal and rest periods and itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair
business practices. Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. Nevarez v. Costco Wholesale
Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-03454; C.D. Cal.). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2019,
the court issued an order denying class certification. In January 2020, the plaintiffs dismissed their Labor Code claims without prejudice, and the
court remanded the action to state court. Settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon in February 2021. Final court approval of the
settlement was granted on May 3, 2022. A proposed intervenor has appealed the denial of her motion to intervene.

In May 2019, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay overtime, to provide
itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Rough
v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-01340; E.D. Cal.). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and
attorneys' fees. In September 2021, the court granted Costco’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied class certification. In August
2019,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  companion  case  in  state  court  seeking  penalties  under  PAGA.  Rough  v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Case  No.
FCS053454; Sonoma County Superior Court). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The
state court action has been stayed pending resolution of the federal action.

In December 2020, a former employee filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of non-exempt employees
under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law for failure to pay for all hours worked, failure to pay certain non-exempt employees
on a weekly basis, and failure to provide proper wage statements and notices. The plaintiff also asserted individual retaliation claims. Cappadora
v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Case  No.  1:20-cv-06067;  E.D.N.Y.).  An  amended  complaint  was  filed,  and  the  Company  denied  the  material
allegations of the amended complaint. Based on an agreement in principle concerning settlement of the matter, involving a proposed payment by
the Company of an immaterial amount, the federal action has been dismissed. In April 2022, Cappadora and a second plaintiff filed an action
against the Company in New York state court asserting the same class claims asserted in the federal action under the New York Labor Law and
seeking  preliminary  approval  of  the  class  settlement.  Cappadora  and  Sancho  v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Index  No.  604757/2022;  Nassau
County Supreme Court).

In August 2021, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on behalf of certain non-exempt employees under New York Labor
Law for failure to pay on a weekly basis. Umadat v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:21-cv-4814; E.D.N.Y.). The Company answered the
complaint on October 21, 2021, denying the material allegations. In April 2022, a former employee filed a similar suit, asserting class claims on
behalf  of  certain  non-exempt  employees  under  New  York  Labor  Law,  as  well  as  under  the  Fair  Labor  Standards Act,  for  failure  to  pay  on  a
weekly basis and failure to pay overtime. Burian v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:22-cv-02108; E.D.N.Y.).

In February 2021, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code regarding payment of
wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, reimbursement of expenses, payment of final wages to terminated employees, and for unfair
business  practices.  Edwards  v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Case  No.  5:21-cv-00716:  C.D.  Cal.).  In  May  2021,  the  Company  filed  a  motion  to
dismiss  the  complaint,  which  was  granted  with  leave  to  amend.  In  June  2021,  the  plaintiff  filed  an  amended  complaint,  which  the  Company
moved to dismiss later that month. The court granted the motion in part in July 2021 with leave to amend. In August 2021, the plaintiff filed a
second  amended  complaint  and  filed  a  separate  representative  action  under  PAGA  asserting  the  same  Labor  Code  claims  and  seeking  civil
penalties and attorneys' fees. The Company filed an answer to the second

61

Table of Contents

amended  class  action  complaint,  denying  the  material  allegations.  The  Company  also  filed  an  answer  to  the  PAGA  representative  action,
denying the material allegations.

In July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company alleging violations of the
California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for
unfair  business  practices.  Dimas  v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Case  No.  STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024;  San  Joaquin  Superior  Court).  The
Company has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021,
the  same  former  employee  filed  a  separate  representative  action  under  PAGA  asserting  the  same  Labor  Code  violations  and  seeking  civil
penalties and attorneys' fees. The case has been stayed pending the motion to compel in the related case.

In September 2021, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the alleged
failure to provide sick pay, failure to timely pay wages due at separation from employment, and for violations of California's unfair competition
law. De Benning v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 34-2021-00309030-CU-OE-GDS; Sacramento Superior Court). The Company answered
the complaint in January 2022, denying its material allegations. In April 2022, a settlement for an immaterial amount was agreed upon, subject to
court approval.

In March 2022, an employee filed a class action against the Company alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding the failure to:
pay wages, provide meal and rest periods, provide accurate wage statements, timely pay final wages, and reimburse business expenses. Diaz v.
Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22STCV09513; Los Angeles Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations.

In  May  2022,  an  employee  filed  a  PAGA-only  representative  action  against  the  Company  alleging  claims  under  the  California  Labor  Code
regarding  the  payment  of  wages,  meal  and  rest  periods,  the  timeliness  of  wages  and  final  wages,  wage  statements,  accurate  records  and
business expenses. Gonzalez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22AHCV00255; Los Angeles Superior Court).

Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of
opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National
Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and
cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on
behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals
seeking  to  recover  alleged  increased  insurance  costs  associated  with  opioid  abuse  in  43  states  and  American  Samoa.  Claims  against  the
Company  in  state  courts  in  New  Jersey,  Oklahoma,  Utah,  and Arizona  have  been  dismissed.  The  Company  is  defending  all  of  the  pending
matters.

Members of the Board of Directors, six corporate officers and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to chicken
welfare and alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Smith, et ano. v. Vachris, et al., Superior Court of the State of Washington, County of King, No,
22-2-08937-7SEA, (filed 6/14/22, as amended, 6/30/22); The complaint seeks from the individual defendants damages, injunctive relief, costs,
and attorneys' fees. A motion to dismiss the amended complaint has been filed.

The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the
matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 11—Segment Reporting

The  Company  is  principally  engaged  in  the  operation  of  membership  warehouses  through  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  in  the  U.S.,  Canada,
Mexico,  Japan,  U.K.,  Korea, Taiwan, Australia,  Spain,  France,  China,  and  Iceland.  Reportable  segments  are  largely  based  on  management’s
organization  of  the  operating  segments  for  operational  decisions  and  assessments  of  financial  performance,  which  considers  geographic
locations.  The  material  accounting  policies  of  the  segments  are  as  described  in  Note  1.  Inter-segment  net  sales  and  expenses  have  been
eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Effective for fiscal 2022, stock-based compensation was allocated to the segments
in  this  reporting. This  change  reflected  a  decision  to  evaluate  the  financial  performance  of  the  segments  inclusive  of  this  expense.  Operating
income was restated in each of the segments for all prior periods to reflect this change.

Item 9—Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
are  designed  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  the  reports  that  we  file  or  submit  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required
to  be  disclosed  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  management,  including  our  principal  executive  and  financial  officers,  to  allow  timely
decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management,
have  reviewed  the  effectiveness  of  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as  of  August  28,  2022,  and,  based  on  their  evaluation,  have
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under  the  Exchange Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies
and  procedures  that:  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  our  transactions  and  the
dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  that  our  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in
accordance  with  appropriate  authorizations;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Projections  of  any
evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under  the  supervision  of  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  we  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial
reporting  as  of August  28,  2022,  using  the  criteria  set  forth  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 28, 2022. The
attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is
included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
occurred  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the  Company’s  internal
control over financial reporting.

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

OF

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION

Exhibit 3.1

The name of this corporation is:

ARTICLE I

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION

ARTICLE II

2.1        Classes.  The  total  number  of  shares  of  all  classes  of  stock  which  this  corporation  shall  have  authority  to  issue  is  one  billion

(1,000,000,000), consisting of:

(a)        Nine  hundred  million  (900,000,000)  shares  of  common  stock,  the  par  value  of  each  of  which  is  $0.01  (the

“Common Stock”).

(b)        One  hundred  million  (100,000,000)  shares  of  preferred  stock,  the  par  value  of  each  of  which  is  $0.01  (the

“Preferred Stock”).

2.2    Preferred Stock. The preferences, limitations and relative rights of the Preferred Stock are undesignated. The board of directors is

authorized to designate one or more series within the Preferred Stock, and the designation and number of shares within each series, and shall

determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of any shares of Preferred Stock, or of any series of Preferred Stock, before issuance

of any shares of that class or series. The board of directors is authorized to amend these Articles as provided in RCW 23B.06.020 to effect the

designation of rights of any series of Preferred Stock.

ARTICLE III

3.1        No  Preemptive  Rights.  The  shareholders  of  this  corporation  have  no  preemptive  rights  to  acquire  additional  shares  of  this

corporation.

3.2    No Cumulative Voting. The right to cumulate votes in the election of directors shall not exist with respect to shares of stock of this

corporation.

3.3        Special  Meetings  of  Shareholders.  The  shareholders  of  this  corporation  shall  have  no  right  to  call  a  special  meeting  of  the

shareholders of this corporation for any purpose or purposes and special meetings of shareholders of this corporation may only be called by a

majority  of  the  board  of  directors  or  the  Chairman,  the  President,  any  Executive  Vice  President  or  the  Secretary  of  this  corporation  of

shareholders  owning  aggregate  at  least  10%  of  all  votes  entitled  to  be  cast  on  any  issue  proposed  to  be  considered  at  the  proposed  special

meeting.

The  number  of  directors  which  shall  constitute  the  whole  board  of  directors  of  this  corporation  shall  be  fixed  by,  or  in  the  manner

provided in the bylaws of this corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time.

ARTICLE IV

ARTICLE V

The  board  of  directors  shall  be  divided  into  three  classes:  Class  I,  Class  II,  and  Class  III.  Such  classes  shall  be  as  nearly  equal  in

number  of  directors  as  possible.  Each  director  shall  serve  for  a  term  ending  at  the  third  annual  shareholders’  meeting  following  the  annual

meeting at which such director was elected. The directors, the class to which they are elected, and the year in which their term expires, are as

follows:

Director
James D. Sinegal
Jeffrey H. Brotman
Richard A. Galanti

At each annual election, the directors chosen to succeed those whose terms then expire shall be identified as being of the same class

as the directors they succeed, unless, by reason of any intervening changes in the authorized number of directors, the board of directors shall

designate one or more directorships whose terms then expire as directorships of another class in order more nearly to achieve equality in the

number of directors among the classes. When the board of directors fills a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director,

the director chosen to fill that vacancy shall be of the same class as the director he succeeds.

Notwithstanding  any  of  the  foregoing  provisions  of  Article  V,  in  all  cases,  including  upon  any  change  in  the  authorized  number  of

directors, each director then continuing to serve as such will nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he is a member, until the

expiration  of  his  current  term  or  his  earlier  death,  resignation  or  removal. Any  vacancy  to  be  filled  by  reason  of  an  increase  in  the  number  of

directors may be filled by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.

Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this Article  V  to  the  contrary,  the  classification  of  directors  as  provide  in  this Article  V  may  be

altered or eliminated only by an amendment to this Article approved by two-third of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group entitled to

vote on such amendment.

ARTICLE VI

A director of this corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for conduct as a

director, except for liability of the director (i) for acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct by the director or a knowing violation of law

by the director, (ii) for conduct violating RCW 23B.08.310 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, or (iii) for any transaction from which the

director will personally receive a benefit in money, property or services to which the director is not legally entitled. If the Washington Business

Corporation Act is amended in the future to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the

liability of a director of this corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the full extent permitted by the Washington Business Corporation Act, as

so amended, without any requirement of further action by the shareholders.

ARTICLE VII

The  corporation  shall  indemnify  any  individual  made  a  party  to  a  proceeding  because  that  individual  is  or  was  a  director  of  the

corporation  and  shall  advance  or  reimburse  the  reasonable  expenses  incurred  by  such  individual  in  advance  of  final  disposition  of  the

proceeding, without regard to the limitations in RCW 23B.08.510 through 23B.08.550 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, or any other

limitation which may hereafter be enacted to the extent such limitation may be disregarded if authorized by the Articles of Incorporation, to the

full extent and under all circumstances permitted by applicable law.

Any repeal or modification of this Article by the shareholders of this corporation shall not adversely affect any right of any individual who

is or was a director of the corporation which existed at the time of such repeal or modification.

Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director, or the entire board of directors, may be

removed from office only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a

ARTICLE VIII

majority of the voting power of all shares of this corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors. As used herein, “for cause" means either

(i) conviction of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction and such conviction is no longer subject to direct appeal or (ii) adjudication for gross

negligence  or  dishonest  conduct  in  the  performance  of  a  director's  duty  to  this  corporation  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  and  such

adjudication  is  no  longer  subject  to  direct  appeal.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary,  this Article  may  be  altered  or  eliminated  only  by

amendment to this Article approved by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group entitled to vote on such amendment.

ARTICLE IX

Amendment of the articles of incorporation, approval of a plan of merger or share exchange, authorization of the sale, lease, exchange

or  other  disposition  of  all,  or  substantially  all  of  the  corporation’s  property,  otherwise  than  in  the  usual  and  regular  course  of  business,  and

authorization of the dissolution of the corporation, shall be approved by each voting group entitled to vote thereon by a simple majority of all the

votes entitled to be cast by that voting group.

Exhibit 4.8

DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

The following description of the Company’s common stock is based upon the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended (“Articles”), the
Company’s Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), and applicable provisions of law. We have summarized certain portions of our Articles and Bylaws
below. This summary is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by express reference to, the provisions of our Articles and
Bylaws, each of which is filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.8 is a part.

Our  authorized  capital  stock  consists  of  900,000,000  shares  of  common  stock,  $0.005  par  value  per  share,  and  100,000,000  shares  of
undesignated preferred stock, $0.005 par value per share.

Common Stock

Dividend Rights. Subject to the prior or preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock outstanding at the time, holders of our common stock
are entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors out of legally available funds.

Voting  Rights.  Each  share  of  our  common  stock  entitles  its  holder  to  one  vote  on  all  matters  voted  on  by  the  shareholders,  including  the
election of directors. We have not provided for cumulative voting for the election of directors in our Articles.

Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions. Subject to the prior or preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock outstanding at the time,
in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally
available for distribution to shareholders.

Rights and Preferences. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to our common stock.

Preferred Stock

Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one
or  more  series  and  to  fix  the  rights,  preferences,  privileges,  and  restrictions  thereof.  These  rights,  preferences,  and  privileges  could  include
dividend  rights,  conversion  rights,  voting  rights,  terms  of  redemption,  liquidation  preferences,  sinking  fund  terms,  and  the  number  of  shares
constituting any series or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of common stock. The issuance of
preferred  stock  by  us  could  adversely  affect  the  voting  power  of  holders  of  common  stock  and  the  likelihood  that  such  holders  will  receive
dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock by us could have the effect of delaying, deferring,
or  preventing  a  change  in  control  of  our  company  or  other  corporate  action.  No  shares  of  preferred  stock  are  outstanding,  and  we  have  no
present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Washington Anti-Takeover Law

Anti-Takeover Provisions

Washington  law  imposes  restrictions  on  some  transactions  between  a  corporation  and  significant  shareholders.  Chapter  23B.19  of  the
Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in specified “significant business transactions” with
an “acquiring person.” This statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with
respect  to  us  and,  accordingly,  may  discourage  unsolicited  attempts  to  acquire  us. An  “acquiring  person”  is  generally  defined  as  a  person  or
group  of  persons  that  beneficially  owns  the  voting  shares  entitled  to  cast  votes  comprising  10%  or  more  of  the  voting  power  of  the  target
corporation. The target corporation may not engage in “significant business transactions,” as defined in Chapter 23B.19, for a period of five years
after the date of the transaction in which the person became an acquiring person, unless (1) the significant business transaction or the acquiring
person’s  purchase  of  shares  was  approved  by  a  majority  of  the  members  of  the  target  corporation’s  board  of  directors  prior  to  the  share
acquisition causing the person to become an “acquiring person,” or (2) the significant business transaction was both approved by the majority of
the members of the target corporation’s board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by
the  outstanding  voting  shares  (excluding  the  acquiring  person’s  shares  or  shares  over  which  the  acquiring  person  has  voting  control)  at  or
subsequent to the acquiring person’s share acquisition. “Significant business transactions” include, among other things:

•

•

•

•

a merger or share exchange with, disposition of assets to, or issuance or redemption of stock to or from, the acquiring person;

a termination of 5% or more of the employees of the target corporation employed in the State of Washington as a result of the
acquiring person’s acquisition of 10% or more of the shares, whether at one time or over the five-year period following the share
acquisition;

a transaction in which the acquiring person is allowed to receive a disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; or

liquidating or dissolving the target corporation.

After the five-year period, a “significant business transaction” may occur, as long as it complies with “fair price” provisions specified in the statute
or is approved at a meeting of shareholders by a majority of the votes entitled to be counted within each voting group entitled to vote separately
on the transaction, not counting the votes of shares as to which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership or voting control. A corporation
may not “opt out” of this statute.

Articles of Incorporation, as Amended and Bylaws, as Amended

Our Articles  and  Bylaws  include  a  number  of  provisions  that  may  have  the  effect  of  deterring  takeovers  or  delaying  or  preventing  changes  in
control  or  changes  in  our  management  that  a  shareholder  might  deem  to  be  in  the  shareholder’s  best  interest.  These  provisions  include  the
following:

•

our Board of Directors may issue up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights or preferences as it may designate;

- 2 -

•

our Articles and Bylaws provide that (1) until the declassification of our Board of Directors implemented by amendments to our
Articles  and  Bylaws  that  became  effective  in  January  2019  is  fully  phased  in  beginning  with  our  2022  annual  meeting  of
shareholders,  the  current  three-year  terms  of  certain  of  our  directors  will  remain  in  effect  until  their  current  terms  expire,  and
(2) only our Board of Directors may change the size of our Board of Directors, which provisions together generally make it more
difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our Board of Directors;

• Washington law, our Articles and Bylaws limit the ability of shareholders from acting by written consent by requiring unanimous

written consent for shareholder action to be effective;

•

•

•

our Articles and Bylaws limit who may call a special meeting of shareholders to only our Board of Directors, Chairman, President,
any Executive Vice President or the Secretary or shareholders owning an aggregate at least 10% of all votes entitled to be cast;

our Bylaws provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates
for  election  as  directors  at  a  meeting  of  shareholders  must  provide  timely  advance  written  notice  to  us  in  writing,  and  specify
requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder’s notice, which may preclude shareholders from bringing matters before
a meeting of shareholders or from making nominations for directors at a meeting of shareholders; and

our Articles do not provide for cumulative voting for our directors, which may make it more difficult for shareholders owning less
than a majority of our capital stock to elect any members to our Board of Directors.
