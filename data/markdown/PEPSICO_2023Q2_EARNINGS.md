PURCHASE,  N.Y.  - July  13,  2023  -  PepsiCo,  Inc.  (NASDAQ:  PEP)  today  reported  results  for

the second quarter 2023.

“We are very pleased with our performance for the second quarter as our business momentum

remains strong.  As a result, we now expect our full-year organic revenue to increase 10 percent

(previously 8 percent) and our core constant currency EPS to increase 12 percent (previously 9

percent),” said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.

Laguarta continued, “Our strong performance and the progress we are making on our strategic

priorities  give  us  confidence  that  the  investments  we  are  making  to  become  an  even  Faster,

even  Stronger,  and  even  Better  organization  by  Winning  with  pep+  are  working.    Moving

forward, we will look to elevate our focus on productivity initiatives to further support investments

in  innovation,  brand  building,  digitalization,  and  sustainability  to  win  in  the  marketplace  and

fortify our businesses for the long-term.”

(a) Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, the volume change shown here differs from the
impact of organic volume on net revenue growth disclosed in the Organic Revenue Growth Rates tables on page A-8, due to
the  impacts  of  product  mix,  nonconsolidated  joint  venture  volume,  and,  for  our  franchise-owned  beverage  businesses,
temporary  timing  differences  between  bottler  case  sales  (BCS)  and  concentrate  shipments  and  equivalents  (CSE).  We
report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated
joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.

(b) The reported change primarily reflects the impact of certain impairment and other charges taken in our Europe division in

2022.

n/m - Not meaningful due to the impact of impairment and other charges in 2022.

Guidance and Outlook

The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are

included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity

mark-to-market net impacts.

For fiscal year 2023, the Company now expects to deliver 10 percent organic revenue growth (previously

8 percent), and 12 percent core constant currency EPS growth (previously 9 percent).

Consistent with its previous guidance for 2023, the Company continues to expect:

• A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; and

•

Total  cash  returns  to  shareholders  of  approximately  $7.7  billion,  comprised  of  dividends  of  $6.7

billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion.

In  addition,  the  Company  continues  to  expect  an  approximate  2-percentage-point  foreign  exchange

translation  headwind  to  impact  reported  net  revenue  and  core  EPS  growth  based  on  current  market

consensus rates.

This assumption and the guidance above imply 2023 core EPS of $7.47 (previously $7.27), a 10 percent

increase (previously 7 percent) compared to 2022 core EPS of $6.79.

Prepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast

At  approximately  6:30  a.m.  (Eastern  time)  on  July  13,  2023,  the  Company  will  post  prepared

management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2023 results and business update, including its

outlook  for  2023,  at  www.pepsico.com/investors.  At  8:15  a.m.  (Eastern  time)  on  July  13,  2023,  the

Company  will  host  a  live  question  and  answer  session  with  investors  and  financial  analysts.  Further

(a) The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 17, 2023, as compared to the 12 and 24 weeks ended

June 11, 2022, primarily reflects higher selling and distribution costs.

(b) In the 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for $3.5 billion in cash and a 39%

noncontrolling interest in a joint venture, Tropicana Brands Group (TBG), operating across North America and Europe (Juice Transaction).

(c) In the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 11, 2022, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, primarily related to the

decrease in fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Non-GAAP Measures
In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with
U.S.  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  (GAAP):  organic  revenue  growth,  core  results  and  core  constant  currency
results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of
our  annual  operating  plan,  evaluation  of  our  overall  business  performance  and  as  a  factor  in  determining  compensation  for
certain  employees.  We  believe  presenting  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provides  additional  information  to  facilitate
comparison  of  our  historical  operating  results  and  trends  in  our  underlying  operating  results  and  provides  additional
transparency  on  how  we  evaluate  our  business.  We  also  believe  presenting  these  measures  allows  investors  to  view  our
performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or
that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which
we  may  make  adjustments  include:  amounts  related  to  mark-to-market  gains  or  losses  (non-cash);  charges  related  to
restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment
charges  (non-cash);  pension  and  retiree  medical-related  amounts,  including  all  settlement  and  curtailment  gains  and  losses;
charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to
the  resolution  of  tax  positions;  tax  benefits  related  to  reorganizations  of  our  operations;  debt  redemptions,  cash  tender  or
exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial
measures included herein.

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute  for  the  related  financial  information  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  addition,  our  non-GAAP  financial
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Glossary
We  use  the  following  definitions  when  referring  to  our  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  which  may  not  be  the  same  as  or
comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:

Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including
changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.

Bottler  case  sales  (BCS):  Measure  of  physical  beverage  volume  shipped  to  retailers  and  independent  distributors  from  both
PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates
in  effect  for  the  comparable  prior-year  period.  In  order  to  compute  our  constant  currency  results,  we  multiply  or  divide,  as
appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide,
as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.

Core:  Core  results  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures  which  exclude  certain  items  from  our  financial  results.  For  further
information regarding these excluded items, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q2 2023 Form 10-Q and in “Item 7 – Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2022. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:

Mark-to-market net impact

Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are
subsequently  reflected  in  division  results  when  the  divisions  recognize  the  cost  of  the  underlying  commodity  in  operating
profit.

Restructuring and impairment charges

Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through
the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.

Acquisition and divestiture-related charges

Acquisition  and  divestiture-related  charges  include  merger  and  integration  charges  and  costs  associated  with  divestitures.
Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.

A - 6

Gain associated with the Juice Transaction

We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.

Impairment and other charges/credits

We  recognized  Russia-Ukraine  conflict  charges,  brand  portfolio  impairment  charges  and  other  impairment  charges  as
described below.

Russia-Ukraine conflict charges

In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.
We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in 2022.

Brand portfolio impairment charges

We recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result
of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We
also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in 2022.

Other impairment charges

We recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase
in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of
2022. We also recognized impairment charges related to our investment in TBG.

Pension and retiree medical-related impact

Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions
exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.

Tax benefit related to the IRS audit

We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of
the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.

Tax expense related to the TCJ Act

Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting
from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Organic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures
and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53rd reporting week), including in our fourth quarter
2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business
because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability
with the prior year.

2023 guidance

Our 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange translation
and the impact of a 53rd reporting week in 2022. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and 2023 core constant currency EPS
growth  guidance  exclude  the  mark-to-market  net  impact  included  in  corporate  unallocated  expenses,  restructuring  and
impairment  charges,  and  other  items  noted  above.  Our  2023  core  constant  currency  EPS  growth  guidance  also  excludes  the
impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023 organic revenue growth to our
full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange due
to  the  unpredictability  of  future  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  and  because  we  are  unable  to  predict  the  occurrence  or
impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate
to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to
our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange or the
mark-to-market  net  impact  on  commodity  derivatives  due  to  the  unpredictability  of  future  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates
and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.

(a) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP. See pages A-6 through A-7 for further discussion.
(b) Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue growth shown here differs from the volume change disclosed in the Summary Second-
Quarter 2023 Performance and Summary Year-to-Date 2023 Performance tables on pages 2 and 3, respectively, due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-
owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated
joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.
