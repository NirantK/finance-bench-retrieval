Overview
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”,
NYSE: JPM), a financial holding company incorporated
under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services
firm based in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with
operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase had $3.7 trillion in
assets and $294.1 billion in stockholders’ equity as of
December 31, 2021. The Firm is a leader in investment
banking, financial services for consumers and small
businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction
processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan
and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers,
predominantly in the U.S., and many of the world’s most
prominent corporate, institutional and government clients
globally.

JPMorgan Chase’s principal bank subsidiary is JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.”), a national banking association with U.S. branches in
48 states and Washington, D.C. as of December 31, 2021.
JPMorgan Chase’s principal non-bank subsidiary is J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan Securities”), a U.S.
broker-dealer. The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of
JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through
overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices
and subsidiary foreign banks. The Firm’s principal operating
subsidiary outside the U.S. is J.P. Morgan Securities plc, a
U.K.-based subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The Firm’s website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan
Chase makes available on its website, free of charge, annual
reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or
Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or
furnishes such material to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) at www.sec.gov. JPMorgan Chase
makes new and important information about the Firm
available on its website at https://
www.jpmorganchase.com, including on the Investor
Relations section of its website at https://
www.jpmorganchase.com/ir. Information on the Firm's
website is not incorporated by reference into this 2021
Form 10-K or the Firm’s other filings with the SEC. The Firm
has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Conduct
for all employees of the Firm and a Code of Ethics for its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and all other
professionals of the Firm worldwide serving in a finance,
accounting, treasury, tax or investor relations role.

Business segments
For management reporting purposes, JPMorgan Chase’s
activities are organized into four major reportable business
segments, as well as a Corporate segment. The Firm’s
consumer business is the Consumer & Community Banking
(“CCB”) segment. The Firm’s wholesale business segments
are the Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”), Commercial
Banking (“CB”), and Asset & Wealth Management (“AWM”).

A description of the Firm’s business segments and the
products and services they provide to their respective client
bases is provided in the “Business segment results” section
of Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations (“Management’s
discussion and analysis” or “MD&A”), beginning on page 46
and in Note 32.

Competition
JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate
in highly competitive environments. Competitors include
other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking
companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity
trading companies, private equity firms, insurance
companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers,
credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust
companies, securities processing companies, automobile
financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and
other internet-based companies, financial technology
companies, and other companies engaged in providing
similar and new products and services. The Firm’s
businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality
and variety of the Firm’s products and services, transaction
execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition
also varies based on the types of clients, customers,
industries and geographies served. With respect to some of
its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes
globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a
national or regional basis. New competitors in the financial
services industry continue to emerge, including firms that
offer products and services solely through the internet and
non-financial companies that offer payment or loan
products.

Developing employees
JPMorgan Chase supports the professional development
and career growth of its employees. An onboarding training
curriculum is required for new hires, which covers Code of
Conduct, compliance and cybersecurity, among other
topics. In addition, the Firm offers extensive training
programs to all employees, covering a broad variety of
topics such as leadership, change management, analytical
thinking, culture and conduct, diversity, equity and
inclusion, and risk and controls. Leadership Edge, the Firm’s
global leadership development Center of Excellence, is
focused on creating one Firm leadership culture.

Compensation and benefits
The Firm provides market-competitive compensation and
benefits programs. JPMorgan Chase’s compensation
philosophy provides the guiding principles that drive
compensation-related decisions across the Firm, including
pay-for-performance, responsiveness and alignment with
shareholder interests, reinforcement of the Firm’s culture
and How We Do Business Principles, and integration of risk,
controls and conduct considerations. The Firm’s
commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for all
employees includes compensation review processes that
seek to ensure that the Firm’s employees are paid equitably
and competitively for the work they do.

The Firm also supports employees’ well-being. JPMorgan
Chase offers an extensive benefits and wellness package to
employees and their families, including healthcare
coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance,
on-site health and wellness centers, employee assistance
programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup
child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs,
mental health counseling and support, and financial
coaching. The Firm has taken action to protect and support
its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, including
continued implementation of health and safety protocols,
and providing additional benefits. For more information on
the Firm’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to
Business Developments on page 50.

Firm culture
The foundations of JPMorgan Chase’s culture are its core
values and How We Do Business Principles, which are
fundamental to the Firm’s success and are represented by
four central corporate tenets: exceptional client service;
operational excellence; a commitment to integrity, fairness
and responsibility; and cultivation of a great team and
winning culture. The Firm maintains its focus on its culture
of inclusion and respect, which is reinforced by its Code of
Conduct and through increasing employee awareness and
education, communication and training. An important part
of these efforts includes the Firm’s Business Resource
Groups, which are groups of employees who support
JPMorgan Chase’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategies
by leveraging the unique perspectives of their members.
The Firm has global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of
excellence, several of which were launched in 2021, that
lead the Firm’s strategy in supporting its commitments to
create more equity and lasting impact in communities, and
strengthen its inclusive culture.

Attracting and retaining employees
The goal of JPMorgan Chase’s recruitment efforts is to
attract and hire talented individuals in all roles and at all
career levels. The Firm strives to provide both external
candidates and internal employees who are seeking a
different role with challenging and stimulating career
opportunities. These opportunities range from internship
training programs for students to entry-level, management
and executive careers. During 2021, approximately two
thirds of the Firm’s employment opportunities were filled
by external candidates, with the remainder filled by existing
employees.

Diversity is an important area of focus throughout the
Firm’s hiring process. JPMorgan Chase engages in efforts
aimed at hiring diverse talent, including initiatives focused
on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, LGBT+
individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others.
The Firm’s global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of
excellence seek to increase representation of and advance
career opportunities for talented diverse individuals across
the Firm through initiatives such as career coaching and
mentorship.

JPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program
that seeks to attract accomplished individuals who have
taken a career break and wish to return to the workforce.
In addition, where appropriate, the Firm’s hiring practices
focus on the skills of a job candidate rather than degrees
held.

Part I

Supervision and regulation
The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive
regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the
applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which
the Firm does business.

Financial holding company:
Consolidated supervision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a bank
holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding company
(“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to
comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and
examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal
Reserve acts as the supervisor of the consolidated
operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chase’s
subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional
authorities based on the activities or licenses of those
subsidiaries.

JPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and, with
respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the “FDIC”).

JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(“FINRA”). Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain
futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised
and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.-
based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation
Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct
Authority (“FCA”).

The Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the
banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory
authorities in the countries in which they operate.

Permissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company
Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other
than the business of banking and certain closely-related
activities. FHCs can engage in a broader range of financial
activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an
FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if
the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries
ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The
Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or
managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are
persistent, may require divestiture of the FHC’s depository
institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an
FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the
Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must
prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any
new activities other than those permissible for BHCs, or
acquiring a company engaged in such activities.

Capital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve
establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for
JPMorgan Chase that are generally consistent with the

4

international Basel III capital and liquidity framework and
evaluates the Firm’s compliance with those requirements.
The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries
and branches are also subject to local capital and liquidity
requirements.

Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and
enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial
institutions. In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued
“Minimum capital requirements for market risk.” The Basel
Committee expects national regulators to implement these
revised market risk requirements for banking organizations
in their jurisdictions by January 2023, in line with the other
elements of the Basel III Reforms. U.S. banking regulators
have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel
III Reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply
such reforms in the U.S.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 .

Stress tests. As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to
supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal
Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”)
framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run
stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to
the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of
separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal
Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the results under the
severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to
determine the Firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)
requirement for the coming year, which forms part of the
Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to file
its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2022. The Federal
Reserve will notify the Firm of its indicative SCB
requirement by June 30, 2022 and final SCB requirement
by August 31, 2022. The Firm’s final SCB requirement will
become effective on October 1, 2022. The OCC requires
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar
stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the
results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse”
scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for more
information concerning the Firm’s CCAR.

Enhanced prudential standards. As part of its mandate to
identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the
U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial
Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) recommends
prudential standards and reporting requirements to the
Federal Reserve for systemically important financial
institutions (“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal
Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those
heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to
risk management and corporate governance of subject
BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under these rules to
comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk

management standards, including oversight by the board of
directors of risk management activities.

Resolution and recovery. The Firm is required to maintain a
comprehensive recovery plan, updated annually,
summarizing the actions it would take to avoid failure by
remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an
adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
required to prepare and submit a recovery plan as directed
by the OCC. The Firm is required to submit periodically to
the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution in
the event of material distress or failure (a “resolution
plan”). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve revised the
regulations governing resolution plan requirements, and on
the basis of those revisions, the Firm’s resolution plan
submissions will alternate between “targeted” and “full”
plans. The Firm’s “targeted” resolution plan was filed on
June 28, 2021. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required
to prepare and submit a separate resolution plan as
directed by the FDIC.

Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are
also subject to local resolution and recovery planning
requirements.

Orderly liquidation authority. Certain financial companies,
including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries,
can also be subjected to resolution under an “orderly
liquidation authority.” The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in
consultation with the President of the United States, must
first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary
financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be
recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent
such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to
resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued
a draft policy statement describing its “single point of
entry” strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly
liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating
subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on
shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership
according to their statutory order of priority.

Holding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan Chase &
Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for
its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit
resources to support those subsidiaries, including when
directed to do so by the Federal Reserve.

Regulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by BHCs and their
banks are subject to requirements, limitations and
prohibitions established by law and by the Federal Reserve
and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to
obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they
acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an
unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial
companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition,
the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed
10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies.
Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must
provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to
acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any

voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in
assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in
nature.”

Ongoing obligations. The Firm is subject to obligations
under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
entered into with the Department of Justice on September
29, 2020 relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries
markets investigations as well as under a related order
issued by the CFTC.

Subsidiary banks:
The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm’s
principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically
authorized under the National Bank Act and related
interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring
an enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could
include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to
conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing
corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank.

FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund
provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is
funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.

FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon the insolvency of
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as
conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets
and liabilities without the approval of the institution’s
creditors.

Prompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant
federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective
action” with respect to a depository institution if that
institution does not meet certain capital adequacy
standards. The Federal Reserve is also authorized to take
appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as
JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized status
of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would
be required to guarantee the performance of the capital
restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.

OCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established
guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large
banks, including minimum standards for the design and
implementation of a risk governance framework for banks.
Under these standards, a bank’s risk governance framework
must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily
distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for
risk management purposes. The bank’s board or risk
committee is responsible for approving the bank’s risk
governance framework, providing active oversight of the
bank’s risk-taking activities, and holding management
accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.

Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions
imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to,

5

Part I

investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives,
securities lending and certain other transactions with,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain other affiliates. These
restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other
affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the
loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with
certain other requirements.

Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the
payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of
dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at
January 1, 2022, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval
of the banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve
also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of
dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in the
banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would
constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the
financial condition of the bank.

Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a
receiver of an IDI for administrative expense and the claims
of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and
deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the
U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims
of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including
depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders.

Consumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and
regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(“CFPB”) with respect to federal consumer protection laws,
including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of
unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection
with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial
products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over
small business lending activities with respect to fair lending
and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its
regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take
enforcement actions against firms that offer certain
products and services to consumers using practices that are
deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The Firm’s
consumer activities are also subject to regulation under
state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General
or empowered agency of each state.

In September 2021, the Firm launched a retail bank in the
U.K. operating through J.P. Morgan Europe Limited
(“JPMEL”) and acquired Nutmeg Saving and Investment
Limited, a U.K. online digital investment manager
(“Nutmeg”). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and both
JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA with respect to
their conduct of financial services in the U.K., including
obligations relating to the fair treatment of customers.
JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems
Regulator with respect to its operation and use of payment
systems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL and
Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection legislation.

Securities and broker-dealer regulation:
The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and
brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer
subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the
SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among
others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities
outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In
the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan
Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and
regulations covering all aspects of the securities business,
including sales and trading practices, securities offerings,
publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the
financing of client purchases, capital structure, record-
keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors,
officers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory
capital on page 96 for information concerning the capital of
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.

Investment management regulation:
The Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are
subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the
world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and
management of client assets, offerings of funds and
marketing activities. Certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries are
registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as
investment advisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s
registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary
and other obligations imposed under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as well as various state securities
laws. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities are subject to
supervision by the OCC.

Derivatives regulation:
The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its
derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose
capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of
standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives,
mandate that certain standardized OTC swaps be traded on
regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of
certain mandated information. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc
are registered with the CFTC as “swap dealers”. In addition,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
registered with the SEC as “security-based swap dealers”
effective November 2021. As a result, these entities are
subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework
applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities,
including capital requirements, rules requiring the
collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based
swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty
collateral, business conduct and documentation standards,
record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud
and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar requirements
have also been established under the European Market
Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and MiFID II, as
implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the CFTC
as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the
National Futures Association.

Data, privacy and security regulation:
The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous U.S.
federal, state and local as well as international laws, rules
and regulations concerning data that are central to the
Firm’s businesses, functions and operations. These include
laws, rules and regulations relating to data protection,
privacy, data use, confidentiality, secrecy, cybersecurity,
technology, artificial intelligence, data localization and
storage, data retention and destruction, disclosure,
transfer, availability, integrity and other similar matters.
Numerous jurisdictions have passed laws, rules and
regulations in these areas and many are considering new or
updated ones that could affect the Firm’s businesses. Many
of these laws apply not only to the Firm’s transactions with
third parties but also to interactions between and among
the Firm’s own affiliates and subsidiaries. The application,
interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and
regulations are often uncertain, particularly in light of new
and rapidly evolving data-driven technologies and
significant increase in computing power. These laws, rules
and regulations are constantly evolving, remain a focus of
regulators globally, may be enforced by private parties or
government bodies, and will continue to have a significant
impact on all of the Firm’s businesses and operations.

The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:
The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial
institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers,
to establish a risk-based system of internal controls
reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-
keeping and reporting requirements, as well as due
diligence/know-your-customer documentation
requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations
and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S.
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). In
addition, the EU and the U.K. have adopted various
economic sanctions programs targeted at entities or
individuals that are, or are located in countries that are,
involved in terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human
rights violations. The Firm is also subject to economic
sanctions laws, rules and regulations in other jurisdictions
in which it operates, including those that conflict with or
prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying
with certain laws, rules and regulations to which it is
otherwise subject.

Anti-Corruption:
The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to
corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and
others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.

Compensation practices:
The Firm’s compensation practices are subject to oversight
by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The

Federal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC
and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive
compensation paid by banking organizations does not
encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the
organizations’ safety and soundness. The Financial Stability
Board (“FSB”) has also established standards covering
compensation principles for banks. The Firm’s
compensation practices are also subject to regulation and
oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the
Fifth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD V”), as
implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which
includes compensation-related provisions. The European
Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on
compensation policies including under CRD V which in
certain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or
supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K.
regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V
compensation policies. The Firm expects that the
implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding
compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue
to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm
structures its compensation programs and practices.

Other significant international regulatory initiatives:
Policymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement an
extensive program of regulatory enhancements relating to
financial services, several key elements of which are
discussed below.

U.K. and EU policymakers have recently proposed changes
to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID
II”). MiFID II, which requires the trading of shares and
certain standardized OTC derivatives to take place on
trading venues and also significantly enhanced
requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency,
transaction reporting and investor protection, and
introduced a position limits and reporting regime for
commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission
published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to
MiFID II focused on changes to the transparency and market
structure rules, including the proposed creation of a
consolidated tape intended to provide investors with a
holistic view of trading across the EU. This legislation is
subject to review by the European Parliament and Council.

In the U.K., Her Majesty’s Treasury (“HMT”) and the FCA
have undertaken a review of MiFID II, as adopted in the U.K.
In July 2021, HMT published its ‘Wholesale Markets Review’
consultation, which proposed a broad range of changes
covering most parts of the MiFID II legislation. HMT is
expected to release its related policy statement in the first
quarter of 2022. Detailed consultations with specific rule
proposals relating to the HMT policy statement are
expected from the FCA during 2022.

In November 2021, EU legislators agreed to delay
implementation of the mandatory buy-in rules required
under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation
(“CSDR”), which were previously scheduled to become
effective on February 1, 2022. In the interim, the European
Securities and Markets Authority published a letter

7

Part I

directing EU competent authorities to not prioritize
supervisory action against firms under the CSDR. The U.K.
previously announced in July 2020 that it would not be
adopting the CSDR settlement discipline regime, which
includes both the buy-in regime and the penalty regime.

The U.K. and EU have also proposed various reforms for the
derivatives market, including proposed amendments to
clearing obligations (“CO”) under the European Markets and
Infrastructure Regulation and to derivatives trading
obligations (“DTO”) under the Markets in Financial
Instruments Regulation, including issuing final rules to
change the CO and DTO to reflect industry transition away
from IBORs to risk-free reference rates.

The finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards for
banks and investment firms, including in relation to the
leverage ratio, counterparty credit risk capital, large
exposures and the net stable funding ratio, have been
implemented through legislation that became effective in
the EU in June 2021 and in the U.K. on January 1, 2022.
The Firm’s banking entities in the U.K. and EU will also be
required to comply with certain changes made by the Basel
Committee to the Basel III framework, including revisions to
the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods,
when they are implemented in those jurisdictions. EU
legislation also requires that certain non-EU banks
operating in the EU establish an intermediate parent
undertaking (“IPU”) located in the EU. The IPU legislation
allows a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would
conflict with “home country” bank separation rules or
impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply
with the EU’s IPU requirements, to the extent applicable, by
December 30, 2023.

The Firm’s banking entities in the U.K. and EU are subject to
supervisory expectations published by the PRA and
European Central Bank (“ECB”), respectively, for
management of financial risks arising from climate change.
These supervisory expectations address bank strategy,
governance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk
reporting and disclosure.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could harm
the global economy and negatively affect JPMorgan
Chase’s businesses.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization
declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus
disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19
pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic,
which included the institution of social distancing and
shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S.
and other countries, resulted in adverse impacts on global
economic conditions, including:

•

•

•

significant disruption and volatility in the financial
markets

significant disruption of global supply chains, and

closures of many businesses, leading to loss of
revenues and increased unemployment.

The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic
have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses and results of operations, including:

•

reduction in demand for certain products and
services from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and
customers, resulting in lower revenue, and

10

•

increases in the allowance for credit losses during
the early stages of the pandemic.

Although global economic conditions have been improving
despite the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, any
ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the
pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the
pandemic, including as a result of additional waves or
variants of the COVID-19 disease or the emergence of other
diseases that have similar outcomes, could have significant
adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of
operations and financial condition, including:

•

recognition of charge-offs and increases in the
allowance for credit losses, including any delayed
recognition of charge-offs due to the impact of
government stimulus actions or payment
assistance provided to clients and customers

• material impacts on the value of securities,

derivatives and other financial instruments which
JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes
markets

•

•

•

downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings

constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated
levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets
(“RWA”) related to supporting client activities,
downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory
actions or other factors, any or all of which could
require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from
taking actions that it otherwise would under its
liquidity and capital management strategies, and

the possibility that significant portions of
JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work
effectively, including because of illness,
quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements,
government actions or other restrictions in
connection with the pandemic.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively
affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations
and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and
liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are
uncertain and cannot be fully predicted, including:

•

•

•

•

the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic

the effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines, and
their availability in certain regions

actions taken by governmental authorities and
other third parties in response to the pandemic,
and

the effect that the pandemic or any prolongation
or worsening of the pandemic may have on the
pace of economic growth, inflation, the strength of
labor markets, particularly in light of the
expiration of government assistance programs,
and the potential for changes in consumer

behavior that could have longer-term impacts on
certain economic sectors.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase's participation in U.S.
government programs designed to support individuals,
households and businesses impacted by the economic
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, whether
directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and
clients or by affiliated entities, newly-acquired businesses
or companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal
investments, could be criticized and subject JPMorgan
Chase to:

•

•

•

increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny

negative publicity, and

increased exposure to litigation,

any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s
operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its
reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic
adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of
operations and financial condition, it may also have the
effect of heightening many of the other risks described
below.

Regulatory

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and
the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan
Chase have a significant impact on its business and
operations.

JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations
worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws,
rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of
the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business.
Regulation of the financial services industry is extensive.

The regulation and supervision of financial services firms
has expanded significantly over an extended period of time.
The increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan
Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and
structures its operations. JPMorgan Chase could be required
to make further changes to its business and operations in
response to expanded supervision or to new or changed
laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments
could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs in
connection with complying with applicable laws, rules and
regulations, which could reduce its profitability.
Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s entry into or acquisition of
a new business or an increase in its principal investments
may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional
laws, rules, and regulations.

In response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations
and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past
been and could in the future be, required to:

•

•

limit the products and services that it offers

reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its
market-making activities

•

•

•

•

•

•

refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it
might otherwise pursue

pay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other
governmental charges, including in connection with the
resolution of tax examinations

incur losses with respect to fraudulent transactions
perpetrated against its customers

dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices
that are disadvantageous

impose restrictions on certain business activities, or

increase the prices that it charges for products and
services, which could reduce the demand for them.

In particular, JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of
operations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws,
rules and regulations, or changes in the application,
interpretation or enforcement of laws, rules and
regulations, that:

•

•

•

proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on
certain financial services activities

impose new requirements relating to the impact of
business activities on environmental, social and
governance (“ESG”) concerns, the management of risks
associated with those concerns and the offering of
products intended to achieve ESG-related objectives, or

introduce changes to antitrust or anti-competition laws,
rules and regulations that adversely affect the business
activities of JPMorgan Chase.

Differences in financial services regulation can be
disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.

The content and application of laws, rules and regulations
affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according
to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in
which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For
example:

•

•

•

larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject
to more stringent supervision and regulation

financial technology companies and other non-
traditional competitors may not be subject to banking
regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state
regulatory agency that does not have the same
resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory
agencies which supervise more diversified financial
services firms, or

the financial services regulatory framework in a
particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions
that are based in that jurisdiction.

These types of differences in the regulatory framework can
result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to
competitors that are less regulated or not subject to
regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial
products.

11

Part I

There can also be significant differences in the ways that
similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services
industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries
and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For
example, when adopting rules that are intended to
implement a global regulatory standard, a national
regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive
requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages
for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that
may be subject to those enhanced regulations.

Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could
require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications
to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant
countries or regions in order to comply with those
requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations
that have been adopted or proposed relating to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding
companies or operating subsidiaries

requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital
or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries

the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking
products and services from markets activities

the resolution of financial institutions

requirements for executing or settling transactions on
exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)

position limits and reporting rules for derivatives

governance and accountability regimes

conduct of business and control requirements, and

restrictions on compensation.

These types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in
financial services regulation have required and could in the
future require JPMorgan Chase to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

divest assets or restructure its operations

absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity
costs

change the prices that it charges for its products and
services

curtail the products and services that it offers to its
customers and clients

curtail other business opportunities, including
acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise
would have pursued, or

incur higher costs for complying with different legal
and regulatory frameworks.

Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s
ability to compete against other firms that are not subject
to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory
oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of
operations and profitability.

12

Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan
Chase to significant penalties and collateral
consequences, and could result in higher compliance
costs or restrictions on its operations.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened
oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many
jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines,
provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties
and experienced other repercussions in connection with
resolving investigations and enforcement actions by
governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become
subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in
the future, and addressing the requirements of any such
resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase
incurring higher operational and compliance costs,
including devoting substantial resources to the required
remediation, or needing to comply with other restrictions.

In connection with resolving specific regulatory
investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators
have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial
institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the
activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of
admissions can lead to:

•

•

•

•

greater exposure in litigation

damage to reputation

disqualification from doing business with certain clients
or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or

other direct and indirect adverse effects.

Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated
a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial
institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty
to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in
connection with resolving regulatory investigations or
enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have
significant collateral consequences for the subject financial
institution, including:

•

•

•

loss of clients, customers and business

restrictions on offering certain products or services,
and

losing permission to operate certain businesses, either
temporarily or permanently.

JPMorgan Chase expects that:

•

•

it and other financial services firms will continue to be
subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and
governmental investigations and enforcement actions

regulators will continue to require that financial
institutions be penalized for actual or deemed
violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement
actions, including the imposition of significant
monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving
these matters through informal supervisory actions;
and

•

regulators will be more likely to pursue formal
enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan
Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject
to other governmental investigations or enforcement
actions.

If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any
resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement
action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet
the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators,
it could be required to, among other things:

•

•

•

enter into further resolutions of investigations or
enforcement actions

pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into
judgments, or

accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes
in the management of, its businesses.

In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become
subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil
litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an
investigation or enforcement action.

JPMorgan Chase can face greater risks of non-compliance
and incur higher operational and compliance costs under
laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-money
laundering, economic sanctions, embargo programs and
anti-corruption.

JPMorgan Chase must comply with laws, rules and
regulations throughout the world relating to anti-money
laundering, economic sanctions, embargo programs and
anti-corruption which can increase its risks of non-
compliance and costs associated with the implementation
and maintenance of complex compliance programs. A
violation of any of these legal and regulatory requirements
could subject JPMorgan Chase, or individual employees, to
regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil
and criminal penalties. In addition, certain national and
multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside
the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that
conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase
from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it
is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also
increase its risks of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can be
negatively impacted in countries with less predictable
legal and regulatory frameworks.

JPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in
certain countries in which the application of the rule of law
is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:

•

•

the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or
guidance for engaging in specific types of business or
transactions

conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or
the inconsistent application or interpretation of
existing laws, rules and regulations

•

•

•

uncertainty concerning the enforceability of
contractual, intellectual property or other obligations

difficulty in competing in economies in which the
government controls or protects all or a portion of the
local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or
corruption may be pervasive, and

the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil
litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of
licenses required to operate in the local market or the
suspension of business relationships with governmental
bodies.

If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in a
particular country is susceptible to producing inconsistent
or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult
environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business
and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations
and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For
example, conducting business could require JPMorgan
Chase to devote significant additional resources to
understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules
and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to
comply with local laws, rules and regulations and
implementing and administering related internal policies
and procedures.

There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always
be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to
conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and
regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates,
and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries
that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems.

Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan
Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to
restructure or reorganize its businesses and could
increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its
businesses.

JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and
FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those
agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in
bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in
the event of material financial distress or failure. The
agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan
may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may
be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or
modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to
make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain
internal or external activities, which could increase its
funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve
clients and customers.

If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine
that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has
deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent
capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on
JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. The
agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase
restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in

13

Part I

ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan
Chase’s operations and strategy.

Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity
securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a
resolution.

Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of
unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-
absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for
purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating
subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a
resolution either:

•

•

in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or

in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II
of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).

If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution,
holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities
of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent
Company and its subsidiaries.

The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under
JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only
the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy
proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be
recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue
normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound
down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent
Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries
would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s
equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors,
including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities.
Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior
position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s
subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by
statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.

Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in
bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt
securities of the Parent Company would realize value only
to the extent available to the Parent Company as a
shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other
subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and
secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully
repaid.

The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry
recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to
resolve a systemically important financial institution, such
as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC
has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution
strategy.

If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a
resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal
Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s
preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of
eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the

14

Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately
followed, could be greater than they might have been under
JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.

Political

Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political
developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses.

Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can
cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market
conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its
businesses. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy
initiatives and proposals could significantly affect U.S. and
global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the
financial markets, including:

• monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal

Reserve and other central banks or governmental
authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset
purchases or any suspension or reversal of those
actions

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and
spending

actions that governments take or fail to take in
response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as
well as the effectiveness of any actions taken

isolationist foreign policies

an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities

economic sanctions

the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist
trade policies, or

other governmental policies or actions adopted or
taken in response to political or social pressures.

These types of political developments, and uncertainty
about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:

•

•

•

•

•

erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and
financial markets, which could potentially undermine
the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency

provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other
countries and otherwise heighten tensions in
diplomatic relations

lead to the withdrawal of government support for
agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal
National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S.
GSEs”)

increase concerns about whether the U.S. government
will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at
any particular time

result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or
governments in other countries

•

•

•

increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal
Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor
perceptions concerning government support of sectors
of the economy or the economy as a whole

adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings
of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan
Chase does business, or

cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in
business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.

These factors could lead to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession

greater market volatility

a contraction of available credit and the widening of
credit spreads

erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial
assets

diminished investor and consumer confidence

lower investment growth

large-scale sales of government debt and other debt
and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries

reduced commercial activity among trading partners

the potential for a currency redenomination by a
particular country

the possible departure of a country from, or the
dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty

potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or

other market dislocations, including the spread of
unfavorable economic conditions from a particular
country or region to other countries or regions.

Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan
Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in
its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital
levels, increase credit risk, hamper its ability to deliver
products and services to its clients and customers, and
weaken its results of operations and financial condition.

Market

Economic and market events and conditions can
materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and
investment and market-making positions.

JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively
affected by adverse changes in any of the following:

•

•

•

•

•

investor, consumer and business sentiment

events that reduce confidence in the financial markets

inflation or deflation

high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor
market

the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit

•

•

levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and
market prices for currencies, equities and commodities,
and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility

the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of
hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities,
cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe
weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of
infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other
extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control,
and

•

the health of the U.S. and global economies.

All of these are affected by global economic, market and
political events and conditions, as well as regulatory
restrictions.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and
market-making businesses can suffer losses due to
unanticipated market events, including:

•

•

•

•

•

severe declines in asset values

unexpected credit events

unforeseen events or conditions that may cause
previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated
(and vice versa)

the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks
related to market-making and investment portfolio
positions, or

other market risks that may not have been
appropriately taken into account in the development,
structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.

If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its
investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this
could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity
and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its
businesses.

JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively
affected by adverse economic conditions and
governmental policies.

JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly
affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

personal and household income distribution

unemployment or underemployment

prolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates

housing prices

the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods
and services

consumer and small business confidence levels, and

changes in consumer spending or in the level of
consumer debt.

15

Part I

Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment
that result in reduced personal and household income could
negatively affect consumer credit performance to the
extent that consumers are less able to service their debts.
In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest
rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions
could diminish customer demand for the products and
services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses.

Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase
in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses
and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan
Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly
worse in certain geographies and industry segments where
declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted
in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or
where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding
student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay
their other consumer loan obligations.

JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses
could also be adversely affected by governmental policies
and actions that affect consumers, including:

•

•

policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance,
education, immigration, employment status and
housing, and

policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as
higher taxes and increased regulation which could
result in reductions in consumer disposable income.

In addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan
obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings
could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan
Chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and
thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and
other consumer loans extended to those customers.

Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an
adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale
businesses.

In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and
economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that
JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it
advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan
Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can
also influence the willingness of other financial institutions
and investors to participate in capital markets transactions
that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or
securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and
sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur,
the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets
businesses, including its loan syndication, securities
underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be
reduced to the extent that those businesses:

earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction
volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable
to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in
unfavorable market conditions, or

•

16

•

dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or
hold larger residual positions in credit commitments
that cannot be sold at favorable prices.

An adverse change in market conditions in particular
segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe
downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity
prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that
affect specific economic sectors, could have a material
adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose
operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly
dependent on the health or stability of those market
segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are
engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur
losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients
that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the
economy that is under stress.

The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client
assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be
diminished by declining asset values or other adverse
macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest
rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the
valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or
holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan
Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of
assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse
macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt
outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause
clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue.
Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan
Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of
the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the
fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or
prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the
weaker investment performance.

An economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer
behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business
spending could also have a negative impact on certain of
JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish
JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations.
For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s
wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of
rental income from commercial real estate properties which
are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse
economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental
cash flows that owners or developers receive from their
tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the
properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or
refinance their commercial real estate loans. These
consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing
increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher
delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its
commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher
costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in
that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings
from its wholesale businesses.

Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can
adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and
income streams related to its traditional banking and
funding activities.

In general, a low or negative interest rate environment may
cause:

•

•

•

•

net interest margins to be compressed, which could
reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its
investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is
unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-
yielding instruments

unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor
behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan
Chase’s broader asset and liability management
strategy

JPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount of deposits that
it accepts from customers and clients, which could
result in lower revenues, and

a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage
servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing
revenues.

When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for
JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit
spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events
and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but
also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events
and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads
will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s
earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are
recorded at fair value.

When interest rates are increasing, JPMorgan Chase can
generally be expected to earn higher net interest income.
However, higher interest rates can also lead to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

fewer originations of commercial and residential real
estate loans

losses on underwriting exposures

the loss of deposits, including in the event that
JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about
depositor behavior

unrealized mark-to-market losses on available-for-sale
(“AFS”) securities held in the investment securities
portfolio

lower net interest income if central banks introduce
interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated
and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of
short-term and long-term borrowings

less liquidity in the financial markets, and

higher funding costs.

All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan
Chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher
interest rates can also negatively affect the payment

performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer
and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable
interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable
to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may
reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing
JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational
costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent
loans.

JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by
market fluctuations and significant changes in the value
of financial instruments.

The value of securities, derivatives and other financial
instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it
makes markets can be materially affected by market
fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions
and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it
extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments.
Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future
periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in
significant changes in the value of these instruments. In
addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial
instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately
realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the
market at that time and may be materially lower than their
current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a
decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan
Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have
an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of
operations.

JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring
processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to
quantify and control JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more
extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s
hedging and other risk management strategies may not be
effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme
market events were to occur.

Credit

JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse
changes in the financial condition of clients,
counterparties, custodians and CCPs.

JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients
and counterparties such as corporations, financial
institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities
exchanges and government entities within and outside the
U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to
the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can
involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client
or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be
subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that
it has appointed to provide custodial services for client
assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the
failure to abide by existing laws and obligations.

A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP
through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would
require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby

17

Part I

increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in
losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to
losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also
a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of
requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a
portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can
be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses
incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial,
settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other
security breaches.

As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is
exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which
it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate
collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day
credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash
management, clearing, custodial and other transaction
services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan
Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or
insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become
involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs,
the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be
subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing
events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and
litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to
the extent that any collateral that it has received is
insufficient to cover those losses.

Transactions with government entities, including national,
state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can
expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit,
operational and reputation risks. Government entities may,
among other things, claim that actions taken by
government officials were beyond the legal authority of
those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a
previous incumbent government. These types of actions
have in the past caused, and could in the future cause,
JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to
conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.

In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation
in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to
make previously agreed-upon payments, which could
subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.

Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives
contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement
procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The
disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase
to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal
costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can
also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage
its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause
harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

The financial or operational failure of a significant market
participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or
concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market
participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial
markets. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be

18

significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it
leads to other market participants incurring significant
losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and
JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant
interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a
significant market participant.

JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of
collateral declines in stressed market conditions.

During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan
Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when:

•

•

•

JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the
collateral it holds

collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient
to recover the full amount owed to it, or

counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether
for operational or other reasons.

Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the
valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant
market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase
could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to
realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in
the value of collateral.

JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising
from concentrations of credit and market risk.

JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market
risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or
counterparties:

•

•

•

engage in similar or related businesses, or in
businesses in related industries

do business in the same geographic region, or

have business profiles, models or strategies that could
cause their ability to meet their obligations to be
similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.

For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality
of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties
could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other
borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or
dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could
exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market
risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses,
including fair value losses in its market-making businesses
and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may
be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with
respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with
directives or expectations of its banking regulators.

Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a
particular industry or geographic area could lead to
concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s
borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular
industry or geography but in related or dependent
industries, wherever located. These conditions could also
heighten concerns about the ability of customers of

JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those
areas or work in those affected industries or related or
dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan
Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various
segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess
the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its
efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those
risks may not be successful.

JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed
by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or
non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain
types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide
reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or
margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-
creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers
subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak
credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this
could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to
JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other
credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on
consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the
U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses
may earn lower revenues in such an environment.

If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively
during a market dislocation, this can increase both the
market and credit risks associated with those positions and
the level of RWA that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance
sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan
Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability
of its businesses.

Liquidity

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could
be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.

JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given
time by factors such as:

• market-wide illiquidity or disruption

•

•

•

•

•

•

unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including
as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations

inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable
times or prices

default by a CCP or other significant market participant

unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral

unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than
anticipated draws on lending-related commitments,
and

lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan
Chase or financial institutions in general.

A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by
events over which it has little or no control. For example,
during periods of market stress, low investor confidence
and significant market illiquidity could result in higher

funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access
to some of its traditional sources of liquidity.

JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative
sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of
funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal
Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of
funding could be more expensive or limited in availability.
JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively
affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order
to:

•

•

•

satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net
stable funding ratio requirements

address obligations under its resolution plan, or

satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside
the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in
subsidiaries that are material legal entities.

More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively
manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund
or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby
adversely affect its results of operations.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends
on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on
its outstanding securities.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the
stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate
holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the
“IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of
JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other
assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding
company.

The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC
substantially all the net proceeds received from securities
issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated
debt securities and of preferred and common stock).

The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to
make payments to the holding company is also
limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory
restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital
adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary
Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and
other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments
to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying
dividends or extending credit to the holding company if
certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if
limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s
management or Board of Directors.

As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding
company to make various payments is dependent on its
receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and
dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations
could affect the holding company’s ability to:

•

pay interest on its debt securities

19

Part I

•

•

•

pay dividends on its equity securities

redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and

fulfill its other payment obligations.

The reform and replacement of benchmark rates could
adversely affect financial instruments issued, funded,
serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase and expose it to
litigation and other disputes.

These arrangements could also result in the holding
company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or
otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time
earlier than would have been the case absent the existence
of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is
subject.

Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may
adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal
subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating
agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and
industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for
a particular financial institution, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

expected future profitability

risk management practices

legal expenses

ratings differentials between bank holding companies
and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries

regulatory developments

assumptions about government support, and

economic and geopolitical developments.

JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the
extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit
ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan
Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the
future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at
times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s
options for responding to events may be more limited and
general investor confidence is low.

A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail
JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its
profitability in a number of ways, including:

•

reducing its access to capital markets

• materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing

securities

•

•

triggering additional collateral or funding
requirements, and

decreasing the number of investors and counterparties
that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend
to JPMorgan Chase.

Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads
charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn,
adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.

20

Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types
of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,” including
those in widespread and longstanding use, have been the
subject of ongoing international, national and other
regulatory scrutiny and initiatives for reform, including:

•

•

•

•

changes to the rules and methodologies under which
certain benchmarks are administered

initiatives designed to discourage or prohibit the use of
certain benchmarks by market participants

the introduction of alternative reference rates to be
used by market participants in lieu of certain
benchmarks, and

legislative proposals and actions providing for the
replacement of reference rates under existing contracts
and instruments that are linked to certain benchmarks
with alternative reference rates.

Some of these reforms are already effective while others
are still to be implemented or are under consideration.
These and other reforms relating to benchmarks could:

•

•

•

•

•

cause certain benchmarks to be substantially modified
or to be permanently discontinued

lead to disruptions in the financial markets, including in
connection with the transition to alternative reference
rates

give rise to litigation and other disputes

cause reputational harm to the extent that operational
and technology systems are not sufficiently prepared
for the transition to alternative reference rates, or

have other consequences which cannot be fully
anticipated.

Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to
regulate, reform or change the administration of
benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the
return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages,
securities, derivatives and other financial instruments
whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including
those issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.

Changes in the manner in which certain benchmarks are
administered, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny
of those benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of
administering or otherwise participating in the setting of
those benchmarks and complying with regulations or
requirements relating to those benchmarks. Such factors
may have the effect of discouraging market participants
from continuing to administer or contribute to certain
benchmarks, trigger further changes in the rules or
methodologies under which certain benchmarks are

administered or lead to the discontinuation of certain
benchmarks.

Regulators, industry bodies and other market participants
in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in
initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of
alternative reference rates to replace certain benchmarks,
and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are
gaining acceptance among market participants. However,
there is no assurance that:

•

•

•

any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the
economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek
to replace

arrangements by market participants to prepare for the
discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the
transition to alternative reference rates will be fully
effective, or

a particular alternative reference rate will be widely
accepted by market participants, or that market
acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the
introduction of other reference rates.

If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an
alternative reference rate has not been successfully
introduced or widely accepted within the market, this could
result in significant adverse effects on the financial
markets. For example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages,
securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are
linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
benchmark. ICE Benchmark Administration, the
administrator of LIBOR, has announced that the publication
of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease after
June 30, 2023, and significant progress has been made by
regulators, industry bodies and market participants to
introduce and implement the Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (“SOFR”) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR.
However, if an alternative reference rate such as SOFR has
not achieved sufficient market acceptance when the
publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR is
discontinued, or if market participants have not otherwise
implemented effective transitional arrangements to address
that discontinuation, this could result in widespread
dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing
of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and the
suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could
have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of
operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit
or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or
held by JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation
and other types of disputes with clients, customers,
counterparties and investors as a consequence of the
transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark
rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan
Chase has:

•

•

treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors
unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher
financing costs or lower returns on investments

failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the
transition from benchmark rates on the products that
JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers,
or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest

• made inappropriate product recommendations to or
investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products
that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection
with the transition from benchmark rates

•

•

engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the
manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in
connection with the discontinuation of or transition
from benchmark rates, or

disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or
investors when interpreting or making determinations
under the terms of agreements or financial
instruments.

These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to
higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to
pay significant amounts in connection with resolving
litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.

Capital

Maintaining the required level and composition of capital
may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business
activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and
distribute capital to shareholders.

JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital
requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital
requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically
Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to
hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge,
a SCB, and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is
reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that
JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these
leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any
given time due to factors such as:

•

•

•

actions by banking regulators, including changes in
laws, rules, and regulations

actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S.
government in response to the economic effects of
systemic events, such as the actions taken in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of
the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits
held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial
institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage
exposure and the GSIB surcharge

changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s
balance sheet or developments that could increase risk
weighted assets such as increased market risk,
customer delinquencies, client credit rating
downgrades or other factors, and

21

Part I

•

increases in estimated stress losses as determined by
the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan
Chase’s SCB.

Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain
the required level and composition of capital, or
unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements,
could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s
shareholders, such as:

•

•

•

•

reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan
Chase is permitted to repurchase

requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the
redemption of, capital instruments in a manner
inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital
management strategy

constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid
on common stock, or

curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or
operations.

Operational

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the
effectiveness of its operational systems and those of
other market participants.

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of
JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction
execution, data processing and other operational systems
to process, record, monitor and report a large number of
transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately,
quickly and securely. In addition to proper design,
installation, maintenance and training, the effective
functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems
depends on:

•

•

the quality of the information contained in those
systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can
significantly compromise the functionality or reliability
of a particular system and other systems to which it
transmits or from which it receives information, and

the ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain
and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to
ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are
managed carefully to ensure security and operational
continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.

JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and
use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and
other market participants, including clearing and payment
systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing,
security and technology companies (including those that
provide cloud computing services).

The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of
operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends,
including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or
other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple

22

effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and
its clients and customers, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

delays or other disruptions in providing services,
liquidity or information to clients and customers

the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to
funds and other assets, including those for which
physical settlement and delivery is required

failure to timely settle or confirm transactions

the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets
trades or other transactions are executed erroneously,
as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended
consequences

financial losses, including due to loss-sharing
requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other
market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to
clients and customers

higher operational costs associated with replacing
services provided by a system that is unavailable

client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan
Chase’s products and services

regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against
JPMorgan Chase

loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or
financial institutions generally, to protect against and
withstand operational disruptions, or

harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and
complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can
become more challenging to effectively maintain and
upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and
infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:

•

•

•

•

•

attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or
its clients and customers may increase, evolve or
become more complex, particularly during periods of
market disruption or economic uncertainty

errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market
participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause
widespread system disruption

isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational
systems compound, or migrate to other systems over
time, to become larger issues

failures in synchronization or encryption software, or
degraded performance of microprocessors, could cause
disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of
systems to communicate with each other, and

third parties may attempt to block the use of key
technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes
on their intellectual property rights.

If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of newly-
acquired businesses or of external parties on which

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet
the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and
operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or
have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could
be materially and adversely affected.

A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could
cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients
and customers.

JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous attempted cyber
attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and
other technology assets on a daily basis from various
actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile
countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or
groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or
social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take
many forms, including attempts to introduce computer
viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to
as “malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These
attacks are often designed to:

•

obtain unauthorized access to confidential information
belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers,
counterparties or employees

• manipulate data

•

•

•

•

destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering
services unavailable

disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan
Chase’s systems

steal money, or

extort money through the use of so-called
“ransomware.”

•

•

JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the
cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of
clients, customers, counterparties and third-party
service providers with which it does business, and

it is possible that a third party, after establishing a
foothold on an internal network without being
detected, might obtain access to other networks and
systems.

The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could
increase in the future due to factors such as:

•

•

•

JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile
banking and other internet-based product offerings and
its internal use of internet-based products and
applications, including those that use cloud computing
services

the acquisition of new businesses, and

the increased use of remote access and third party
video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from-
home arrangements for employees.

In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential
information obtained by intercepting signals or
communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan
Chase’s employees.

A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of
JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor,
governmental body or another market participant could
cause serious negative consequences, including:

•

significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations
and those of its clients, customers and counterparties,
including losing access to operational systems

JPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed
denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt
online banking services.

• misappropriation of confidential information of

JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,
counterparties, employees or regulators

JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to
cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional
breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could
result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan
Chase or its clients and customers.

A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide
absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not
always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats
to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective
preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:

•

•

the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently
and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may
not be recognized until launched

cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of
sources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees,
cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist
organizations or hostile countries, or third parties
whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial
institutions more generally

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems
and those of its clients, customers and counterparties

the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully
recover and restore data that has been stolen,
manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent
systems from processing fraudulent transactions

violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and
other laws

financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,
customers, counterparties or employees

loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity
and business resiliency measures

dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients,
customers or counterparties

significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines,
penalties or other sanctions, and

harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

23

Part I

The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that
JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack
may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant
amount of time before such an investigation can be
completed. While such an investigation is ongoing,
JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of
the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may
continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan
Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information
about the cyber attack to its clients, customers,
counterparties and regulators, as well as the public.
Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and
remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain
errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before
they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these
factors could further increase the costs and consequences
of a cyber attack.

JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to
identify and address operational risks associated with the
introduction of or changes to products, services and
delivery platforms.

When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service,
introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of
products or services (including mobile connectivity,
electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests
in a business or makes changes to an existing product,
service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or
identify new operational risks that may arise from those
changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to
mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any
significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan
Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or
result in:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

potential liability to clients, counterparties and
customers

increased operating expenses

higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines,
penalties and other sanctions

damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation

impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity

regulatory intervention, or

weaker competitive standing.

Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and
adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of
operations.

JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer
satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of
an external operational system.

External operational systems with which JPMorgan is
connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of
operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may
be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack
that may be experienced by a vendor or market

24

infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly
connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack
involving another party to which such a vendor or
infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data
aggregators and other external parties with which
JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase
JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the
case where activities of customers or those parties are
beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems,
including through the use of the internet, cloud computing
services, and personal smart phones and other mobile
devices or services.

If an external party obtains access to customer account data
on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that party experiences a
cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that
data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for
JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:

•

•

•

•

heightened risk that external parties will be able to
execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan
Chase’s systems

losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential
liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in
consumer protection laws, rules and regulations

increased operational costs to remediate the
consequences of the external party’s security breach,
and

reputational harm arising from the perception that
JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.

As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients,
customers and other external parties continues to expand,
JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational
failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those
parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s
clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures,
security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting
other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take
steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems
or to safeguard confidential information, including
restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These
actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs
and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and
confidence in JPMorgan Chase.

Furthermore, the widespread and expanding
interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing
banks, CCPs, payment processors, financial technology
companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other
financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the
disruption of an operational system involving one institution
or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause
industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially
affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations rely on its ability, and the
ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-
staffed workforces, and on the competence,
trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses
efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that
meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to
maintain an effective risk management framework is highly
dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately
and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its
employees. JPMorgan Chase is similarly dependent on the
workforces of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s
operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial
markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could
be materially and adversely affected by:

•

•

•

•

•

the ineffective implementation of business decisions

any failure to institute controls that appropriately
address risks associated with business activities, or to
appropriately train employees with respect to those
risks and controls

staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets

a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft,
fraud or other unlawful conduct, or

other negative outcomes caused by human error or
misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of
another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations
depend.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if the
measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help
ensure the health and safety of its employees are
ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan
Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions
to protect the health and safety of its employees.

JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational
risks in safeguarding personal information.

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and
evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and
outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of
personal information of individuals. The protected parties
can include:

•

•

•

•

JPMorgan Chase’s current, prospective and former
clients and customers

clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and
customers

current, prospective and former employees, and

employees of JPMorgan Chase’s vendors,
counterparties and other external parties.

Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, sharing and
storage of personal information comply with all applicable
laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions,
including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in
conflict, can:

•

•

•

•

increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating
costs

hinder the development of new products or services,
curtail the offering of existing products or services, or
affect how products and services are offered to clients
and customers

demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s
management, and

require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses,
operations and systems in less efficient ways.

Not all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors,
counterparties and other external parties may have
appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality
of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan
Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by
electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to
litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if
personal information of clients, customers, employees or
others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations
where such information is:

•

•

erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted
to have the information, or

intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized
third parties.

Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s
measures to safeguard personal information, or even the
perception that those measures are inadequate, could
cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients
and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s
revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by
JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data
protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to
inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result
in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or
practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties
or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan
Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its
businesses.

In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the
inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal
information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of
practices relating to the safeguarding of personal
information by companies in the U.S. and other countries.
That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the
future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and
regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and
storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules
and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict
financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from
sharing information among affiliates or with third parties
such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or
could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal data when
developing or offering products or services to customers.
These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s

25

Part I

development or marketing of certain products or services,
or increase the costs of offering them to customers.

counterparties and employees, could become more
significant and long-lasting.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation
could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events
beyond its control.

JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could
be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed,
by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially
beyond its control, including material instances of:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

cyber attacks

security breaches of its physical premises, including
threats to health and safety

power, telecommunications or internet outages, or
shutdowns of mass transit

failure of, or loss of access to, technology or
operational systems, including any resulting loss of
critical data

damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan
Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries,
including in connection with any construction projects
undertaken by JPMorgan Chase

effects of climate change

natural disasters or severe weather conditions

accidents such as explosions or structural failures

health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases,
epidemics or pandemics, or

events arising from local or larger-scale civil unrest,
any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or terrorist
acts.

JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program
that is intended to enable it to recover critical business
functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology
and facilities, in the event of a business disruption,
including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event
beyond its control. There can be no assurance that
JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all
potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its
clients, and customers and third parties with which it does
business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to
address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple
business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s
ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event
could be hampered to the extent that the members of its
workforce, physical assets or systems and other support
infrastructure needed to address the event are
geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event
were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated.
Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that
cause or contribute to those events become more chronic,
the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s
business and operations, and on its clients, customers,

26

Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s
operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one
or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control,
could:

•

•

•

•

•

•

hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to
its clients and customers or to transact with its
counterparties

require it to expend significant resources to correct the
failure or disruption or to address the event

cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss
of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries

disrupt market infrastructure systems on which
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely

expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions, and

harm its reputation.

Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the
oversight of vendors and other service providers can
result in higher costs and other potential exposures.

JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and
other standards associated with doing business with
vendors and other service providers, including standards
relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the
performance of significant banking and other functions by
subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and
expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the
risks associated with oversight of its internal and external
service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately
assess and manage these relationships, especially those
involving significant banking functions, shared services or
other critical activities, could materially adversely affect
JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result
in:

•

•

•

•

•

potential harm to clients and customers, and any
liability associated with that harm

regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions

lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost
revenues

increased operational costs, or

harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not
be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to
JPMorgan Chase.

Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk
management framework, governance structure, practices,
models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected
losses, and its financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected. Any such
inadequacy or lapse could:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to
JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of
Directors

lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes
for JPMorgan Chase

require significant resources and time to remediate

lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations

attract heightened regulatory scrutiny

expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or
legal proceedings

subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions

lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and
any liability associated with that harm

harm its reputation, or

otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk
exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of
JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation
processes could result in ineffective risk management
practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate
risk reporting.

Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and
techniques consider historical market behavior and to some
degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or
assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan
Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical
correlations among prices of various asset classes or other
market indicators. In times of market stress, including
difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event
of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated
indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-
correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those
times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated
market or economic movements could, in some
circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s
risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.

JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its
capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater
regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or
judgments, including those used in its financial
statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.

JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of
models and other analytical and judgment-based
estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls
over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and
other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and
estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in
connection with the preparation of its financial statements
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”).

These models and estimations are based on a variety of
assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically
reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and
estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective
in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a
variety of factors, such as:

•

•

•

•

•

reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the
future, including assumptions underlying the models
and estimations such as correlations among certain
market indicators or asset prices

inherent limitations associated with forecasting
uncertain economic and financial outcomes

historical trend information may be incomplete, or may
not be indicative of severely negative market
conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack
of liquidity

sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of
certain loans and securities may make it more difficult
to value certain financial instruments

technology that is introduced to run models or
estimations may not perform as expected, or may not
be well understood by the personnel using the
technology

• models and estimations may contain erroneous data,

valuations, formulas or algorithms, and

•

review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and
estimations.

JPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if
models, estimates or judgments used or applied in
connection with its risk management activities or the
preparation of its financial statements prove to have been
inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market
prices are not available for certain financial instruments
that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan
Chase may make fair value determinations based on
internally developed models or other means which
ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates
and judgment.

Similarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for
expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which
requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments
including forecasts of how economic conditions might
impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and
counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations.
These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to
be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. In
addition, certain models used by JPMorgan Chase as a basis
for the determination of the allowance for expected credit
losses experienced heightened performance risk in the
economic environment during the early stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic. These models are based on historical
experience of internally-developed macroeconomic
scenarios, and when the current and forecasted
environment is significantly different from the scenarios

27

Part I

underlying those models, JPMorgan Chase may need to
apply a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform
any adjustments that it has made or may make to model
outputs.

Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing
risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of,
JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required
before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and
estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA
and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan
Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its
regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges,
which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the
ability to expand its businesses.

Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting
could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or
reputation.

There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s
disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every
circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant
deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will
not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in
inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:

• materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s
business and results of operations or financial
condition

•

•

•

•

•

restrict its ability to access the capital markets

require it to expend significant resources to correct the
lapses or deficiencies

expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions

harm its reputation, or

otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan
Chase.

Strategic

If JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and
execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate
changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s
competitive standing and results could suffer.

JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its
competitive standing and operations. These strategies
relate to:

the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers

the geographies in which it operates

the types of clients and customers that it serves

the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests

the counterparties with which it does business, and

the methods and distribution channels by which it
offers products and services.

•

•

•

•

•

•

28

If management makes choices about these strategies and
goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess
the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to
address changing regulatory and market environments or
the expectations of clients, customers, investors, employees
and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and
growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may
suffer and its earnings could decline.

JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on
management’s ability to develop and execute effective
business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in
the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s
effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s
ability to develop and enhance its resources, control
expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these
objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the
part of management to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

devise effective business plans and strategies

offer products and services that meet changing
expectations of clients and customers

allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term
stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest
in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed
environment

allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise
modeling or subjective judgments made in connection
with those allocations

appropriately address concerns of clients, customers,
investors, employees and other stakeholders, including
with respect to social and sustainability matters

react quickly to changes in market conditions or market
structures, or

develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk,
financial and managerial resources necessary to grow
and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.

Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in
connection with disposing of excess properties, premises
and facilities, and those costs could be material to its
results of operations in a given period.

JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing
competition in the rapidly evolving financial services
industry.

JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive
environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the
significant changes as a result of changes in financial
regulation, technological advances, increased public
scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan
Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global
financial services industry will continue to be intense.
Competitors include:

•

•

other banks and financial institutions

trading, advisory and investment management firms

•

•

•

finance companies

technology companies, and

other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing
similar products and services.

JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the
significant competition in the financial services industry will
not materially and adversely affect its future results of
operations.

New competitors in the financial services industry continue
to emerge. For example, technological advances and the
growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-
depository institutions to offer products and services that
traditionally were banking products. These advances have
also allowed financial institutions and other companies to
provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions,
including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading,
payments processing and online automated algorithmic-
based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial
institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk
that payments processing and other products and services,
including deposits and other traditional banking products,
could be significantly disrupted by the use of new
technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other
applications that use secure distributed ledgers, that
require no intermediation. New technologies have required
and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify
or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and
customers or to match products and services offered by its
competitors, including technology companies. In addition,
new technologies may be used by customers, or breached
or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which
can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with
laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of
products and services through those technologies and
reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from
providing products and services through those
technologies.

Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the
pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may
cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly
with respect to traditional banking products. This
competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of
products and services offered, transaction execution,
innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of
clients and customers, whether due to general market
conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a
particular product or service, changes in client and
customer expectations or other factors, could affect
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and
customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce
JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also
may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital
investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its
capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain
competitive.

The effects of climate change could adversely impact
JPMorgan Chase and its clients.

JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and
communities around the world where its businesses, and
the activities of its clients and customers, could be impacted
by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a
financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in
the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to
a low-carbon economy, including changes in climate policy
or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to
risks posed by climate change.

Climate-related physical risks include acute weather events,
such as hurricanes and floods, and chronic shifts in the
climate, such as altered distribution and intensity of
rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased
frequency of wildfires, rising sea levels, or a rising heat
index. Climate-related physical risks could have adverse
financial and other impacts on JPMorgan Chase, both
directly on its business and operations and as a result of
impacts to its clients and customers, including:

•

•

•

•

declines in asset values, including due to the
destruction or degradation of property

reduced availability of insurance

significant interruptions to business operations,
including supply chain disruption, and

systemic changes to geographies, regional economies
and sectors, and any resulting population migration or
unemployment.

Transition risks arise from the process of adjusting to a low-
carbon economy. In addition to possible changes in climate
policy and financial regulation, potential transition risks
may include economic and other changes engendered by
the development of low-carbon technological advances
(e.g., electric vehicles and renewable energy) and/or
changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon
goods and services. Transition risks could be further
accelerated by the occurrence of changes in the physical
climate. The possible adverse impacts of transition risks to
both JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers include:

•

•

•

•

sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated
write-downs (“stranded assets”)

increased operational and compliance costs driven by
changes in climate policy and/or regulations

negative consequences to business models, and the
need to make changes in response to those
consequences, and

damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including as a
result of any perception that its business practices are
contrary to public policy or stakeholder preferences.

Both physical risks and transition risks could have negative
impacts on the revenues, financial condition or
creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and
on its exposure to those clients and customers.

29

Part I

Conduct

Conduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm
clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and
regulatory action.

JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients,
customers and counterparties, and with each other, every
day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and
exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan
Chase’s Code of Conduct and How We Do Business
Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do
first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase
endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout
an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding,
training and development, and performance
management. Conduct risk management is also an integral
component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and
compensation processes.

Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices,
certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal
conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have
resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental
investigations or enforcement actions involving consent
orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution
agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is
no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions
by employees will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms
of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that
any such actions will always be detected, deterred or
prevented.

JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and
collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one
or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance
with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices,
including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers,
other market participants or other employees. Some
examples of this include:

improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s
products or services

•

•

using electronic communications channels that have
not been approved by JPMorgan Chase

engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment
with respect to clients, customers or employees, or
acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a
diverse and inclusive workplace

• managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate

JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business
performance goals or employee compensation
objectives, and

• misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary

information, or technology assets belonging to
JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third
parties.

The consequences of any failure by one or more employees
to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s
expectations, policies or practices could include litigation,
or regulatory or other governmental investigations or
enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions
could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or
other sanctions, or lead to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

financial losses

increased operational and compliance costs

greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties

regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to
restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities

the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s
management

loss of clients or customers, and

harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to
newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to
successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any
of those employees do not conduct themselves in
accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies
and practices.

engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or
unauthorized trading

Reputation

engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in
connection with government relief programs

facilitating a transaction where a material objective is
to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial
disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by
governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the
proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the
economic substance of the transaction

failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties
owed to clients or customers

violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding
with other market participants

Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its
businesses.

Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability
to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and
employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can
therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s
business and prospects, and can arise from numerous
sources, including:

•

employee misconduct, including discriminatory
behavior or harassment with respect to clients,
customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to
JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and
inclusive workplace

•

•

•

•

•

•

30

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks

failure to safeguard client, customer or employee
information

failure to manage risks associated with its business
activities or those of its clients, including those that
may be unpopular among one or more constituencies

failure to fully discharge publicly-announced
commitments to support social and sustainability
initiatives

non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations

operational failures

litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other
sanctions

actions taken in executing regulatory and
governmental requirements during a global or regional
health emergency

regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or
resolutions of these matters, and

failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules
or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients,
customers, counterparties or other parties, including
newly-acquired businesses, companies in which
JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments,
parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and
vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.

JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged
by adverse publicity or negative information regarding
JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be
published or broadcast by the media or posted on social
media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the
internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and
pervasiveness with which information is disseminated
through those channels.

Social and environmental activists are increasingly
targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase
with public criticism for their relationships with clients that
are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including
businesses whose products are or are perceived to be
harmful to human health, or whose activities negatively
affect or are perceived to negatively affect the
environment, workers’ rights or communities. Activists have
also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s
headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of
JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive
industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among
clients, customers, investors and employees with how
JPMorgan Chase addresses social and sustainability
concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to
activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could
damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients and
customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in
jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose
views are not aligned with those of social and

environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm
to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could:

•

•

•

•

•

•

cause certain clients and customers to cease doing
business with JPMorgan Chase

impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients
and customers, or to expand its relationships with
existing clients and customers

diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain
employees

prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with
certain clients or customers.

cause certain investors to divest from investments in
securities of JPMorgan Chase, or

attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory
bodies.

Actions by the financial services industry generally or
individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s
reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a
whole can be damaged by concerns that:

•

•

consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial
institution, or

a financial institution has acted inappropriately with
respect to the methods used to offer products to
customers

If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these
types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among
clients or customers.

Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of
interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in
litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage
JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of
interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its
business activities which encompass a variety of
transactions, obligations and interests with and among
JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase
can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions,
and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or
perceived failure to:

•

•

•

•

adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts
of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that
may arise in connection with providing multiple
products and services in, or having one or more
investments related to, the same transaction

deliver appropriate standards of service and quality

treat clients and customers with the appropriate
standard of care

use client and customer data responsibly and in a
manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory
expectations

31

Part I

•

•

provide fiduciary products or services in accordance
with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or

handle or use confidential information of customers or
clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable
data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations.

A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address
conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in
customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines,
penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory
scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to
lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious
harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

Country

An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries
or within a country or region could have a material
adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan
Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally.

Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups,
including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could
expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries
or escalating into full-scale war with potentially
catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of
the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the
scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:

•

•

•

•

•

•

worldwide economic disruption

heightened volatility in financial markets

severe declines in asset values, accompanied by
widespread sell-offs of investments

substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially
leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in
the affected region

disruption of global trade, and

diminished consumer, business and investor
confidence.

Any of the above consequences could have significant
negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and
earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected
by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to
become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead
to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase
may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in
any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities.
JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and
aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the
sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a
conflict.

JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain
countries can be adversely affected by local economic,
political, regulatory and social factors.

Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts
business have economies or markets that are less
developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and

32

regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable
than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In
addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase
conducts business, the local economy and business activity
are subject to substantial government influence or control.
Some of these countries have in the past experienced
economic disruptions, including:

•

•

•

•

extreme currency fluctuations

high inflation

low or negative growth, and

defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.

The governments in these countries have sometimes
reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive
policies that adversely affect the local and regional business
environment, such as:

•

•

•

price, capital or exchange controls, including
imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility
restrictions or forced currency exchange

expropriation or nationalization of assets or
confiscation of property, including intellectual
property, and

changes in laws, rules and regulations.

The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading
markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than
more-developed markets. These types of government
actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations
in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the
business activities of local clients or multi-national clients
that conduct business in the jurisdiction.

In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain
more developed countries, have been susceptible to
unfavorable social developments arising from poor
economic conditions or governmental actions, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general
strikes

crime and corruption

security and personal safety issues

an outbreak or escalation of hostilities

overthrow of incumbent governments

terrorist attacks, and

other forms of internal discord.

These economic, political, regulatory and social
developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future
could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan
Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the
revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In
addition, any of these events or circumstances in one
country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and
investments in another country or countries, including in
the U.S.

People

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified
and diverse employees is critical to its success.

JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important
resource, and in many areas of the financial services
industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense.
JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse
new employees and retain, develop and motivate its
existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain
talented and diverse employees can be particularly
challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for
recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable
to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse
employees, including successors to the Chief Executive
Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other
senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its
competitive position, could be materially and adversely
affected.

Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies
could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and
operations.

JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and
expertise of employees located throughout the world.
Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and
other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it
more difficult for employees or their family members to
work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in
which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its
business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract
and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the
quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to
make structural changes to its worldwide or regional
operating models that cause its operations to be less
efficient or more costly.

Legal

JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from
litigation and formal and informal regulatory and
government investigations.

JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise
involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions
and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions
currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions
adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could
materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business,
financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious
reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services
industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to
experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and
government investigations related to its businesses and
operations.

Regulators and other government agencies conduct
examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both
on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan
Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to

heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened
regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation
or examination, may lead to additional regulatory
investigations or enforcement actions. There is no
assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or
other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase.
Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation
of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and
overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by
multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the
U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other
governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.

If another financial institution violates a law or regulation
relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will
often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other
governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or
practice by JPMorgan Chase.

These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S.
governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions,
and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its
operations and activities or to cease offering certain
products or services. All of these potential outcomes could

The premises and facilities occupied by JPMorgan Chase are
used across all of the Firm’s business segments and for
corporate purposes. JPMorgan Chase continues to evaluate
its current and projected space requirements and may
determine from time to time that certain of its properties
(including the premises and facilities noted above) are no
longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance
that the Firm will be able to dispose of any such excess
properties, premises or facilities, or that it will not incur
costs in connection with such dispositions. Such disposition
costs may be material to the Firm’s results of operations in
a given period. Refer to the Consolidated Results of

Refer to Note 21 for a discussion of restrictions on dividend

Repurchases under the common share repurchase
program
Refer to Capital actions in the Capital Risk Management
section of Management’s discussion and analysis on page
94 for information regarding repurchases under the Firm’s
common share repurchase program.

On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized
a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and
common stock dividends in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the
Firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire on
June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the 2021 CCAR
stress test. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the
regulatory capital framework. The Firm continues to be authorized to repurchase common shares under its existing common
share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors.

Shares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during 2021 were as follows.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

The internal control framework promulgated by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”), “Internal Control — Integrated
Framework” (“COSO 2013”), provides guidance for
designing, implementing and conducting internal control
and assessing its effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO
2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firm’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2021. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control
over financial reporting” on page 156.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation,
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively.

The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless,
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls
may occur from time to time, and there can be no
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal
control in the future and collateral consequences

Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $48.3 billion for
2021, or $15.36 per share, on net revenue of $121.6
billion. The Firm reported ROE of 19% and ROTCE of 23%.
The Firm's results for 2021 included a reduction in the
allowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion.
• The Firm had net income of $48.3 billion, up 66%, driven

by a net benefit in the provision for credit losses,
compared to an expense recorded in the prior year.

• Total net revenue was up 1%.

– Noninterest revenue was $69.3 billion, up 6%, driven

by higher Investment Banking fees and asset
management fees, partially offset by lower CIB Markets
revenue.

– Net interest income was $52.3 billion, down 4%,
driven by the impact of lower market rates and
changes in the balance sheet mix, partially offset by
balance sheet growth.

• Noninterest expense was $71.3 billion, up 7%,

predominantly driven by higher compensation expense
and continued investments in the business, including
technology.

• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $9.3

billion, driven by;

– a $12.1 billion reduction in the allowance for credit

losses primarily reflecting improvements in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook, and

– $2.9 billion of net charge-offs predominantly driven by

The prior year provision was an expense of $17.5 billion,
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses
of $12.2 billion, and $5.3 billion of net charge-offs.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $18.7 billion at
December 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.62%,
compared with 2.95% in the prior year; the decrease
from the prior year was driven by reductions in the
allowance for credit losses.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.3 billion at
December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the
prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting
the impact of net portfolio activity and client-specific
upgrades in wholesale, as well as improved credit
performance in consumer; and lower loans at fair value in
the CIB consumer portfolio, largely due to sales.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 3%,

driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, partially offset by
lower loans in CCB and CB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.3 trillion were up 23%,
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs, primarily
driven by the effect of certain government actions in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as growth

Business Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, the
Firm has remained focused on serving its clients, customers
and communities, as well as the well-being of its employees.
The Firm continues to actively monitor and adapt to health
and safety developments at local and regional levels as
more of its global workforce returns to the office.

For information on the impact of U.S. government actions
and programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer
to:

• Credit Portfolio on page 109 for information on PPP,

• Consumer Credit Portfolio on page 112 and Wholesale

Credit Portfolio on page 118 for information on retained
loans under payment deferral, and

• Note 12 on page 231 for information on the Firm’s loan

modification activities.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to
make progress with respect to the transition from the use of
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other
IBORs to comply with the International Organization of
Securities Commission’s standards for transaction-based
benchmark rates. As of January 1, 2022, ICE Benchmark
Administration ceased the publication of all tenors of LIBOR
for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR
(collectively, “non-U.S. dollar LIBOR”) and the one-week
and two-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR. The cessation of
the publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR
(i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and
12-month LIBOR) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.

In joint statements issued by the Federal Reserve, the OCC
and the FDIC, the banking regulators encouraged U.S. banks
to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar
LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021. The Firm
has ceased executing contracts that reference U.S. dollar
LIBOR, with certain permissible limited exceptions, and now
offers various floating rate products, and provides and
arranges various types of floating rate debt financings,
across its businesses that reference replacement rates,
including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).
The Firm continues to engage with clients in relation to the
transition from the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR and
to support clients as they move to replacement rates.

On November 16, 2021 the Financial Conduct Authority
(“FCA”) confirmed that it will allow, for a period of at least
one year, the use of “synthetic” U.K. sterling and Japanese
yen LIBOR rates in all legacy LIBOR contracts, other than
cleared derivatives, that had not been transitioned to
replacement rates by January 1, 2022. The use of these
synthetic LIBORs, will allow market participants additional
time to complete their transition to replacement rates or
otherwise to reduce their exposure to contracts that do not
have robust fallback mechanisms and that are difficult to
amend.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the principal central
counterparties (“CCPs”) converted cleared derivatives
contracts linked to non-U.S. dollar LIBOR to replacement
rates before the cessation of the publication of those
LIBORs on December 31, 2021.

The Firm has made significant progress towards reducing its
exposure to IBOR-referencing contracts, including in
derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and
debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to meet
its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as
the industry milestones and recommendations published by
National Working Groups, including the Alternative
Reference Rates Committee in the U.S.

In connection with the transition from LIBOR, as of
December 31, 2021 the Firm had remediated substantially
all of the notional amount of its bilateral derivatives
contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR and non-U.S. dollar

50

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

LIBOR, and substantially all of its non-U.S. dollar LIBOR-
linked loans. The Firm continues its client outreach with
respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked loans.

The Firm is also on schedule to implement further
necessary changes to risk management systems in order to
transition from LIBOR, including modifications to its
operational systems and models. In 2021, the Firm changed
the rate basis of its transfer pricing methodology for U.S.
dollar-denominated contracts to SOFR and implemented
internal controls to restrict the use of LIBOR in new
transactions.

Legislation intended to reduce the likelihood of disputes
arising from the cessation of LIBOR has been adopted or
proposed in certain jurisdictions. The Firm continues to
review the extent to which these legislative actions or
proposals, if enacted, may reduce the risk of litigation and
disputes arising from the transition from LIBOR.

The Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry,
market, regulatory and legislative developments, including
the transition relief issued by the Internal Revenue Service
and U.S. Treasury Department in January 2022 with respect
to the tax implications of reference rate reform.

(b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current

presentation. Refer to Note 25 for further information.

2021 compared with 2020
Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB,
reflecting:

• higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and

wallet share gains

• higher equity underwriting fees due to a strong IPO

market and wallet share gains, and

• higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by an

active leveraged loan market primarily related to
acquisition financing.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72 and Note 6 for
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting:
• lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets, primarily in

Rates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, Credit and
Commodities, compared to a strong prior year, and an
increase in Securitized Products, and

• lower net valuation gains on several legacy equity

investments in Corporate,

partially offset by

• higher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong
performance across derivatives, prime brokerage, and
Cash Equities

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66,
pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for
additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased driven by:

• higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB as a

result of higher average market levels and net inflows,
and

• higher custody fees in CIB Securities Services, primarily

associated with higher assets under custody.

Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages
63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 76-78, respectively, and
Note 6 for additional information.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net losses
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio,
compared with net gains in the prior year from sales of U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Refer to Corporate
segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for additional
information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting a net

loss in MSR risk management results primarily driven by
updates to model inputs related to prepayment
expectations, and

• lower mortgage production revenue on lower production

margins.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66, Note 6 and
15 for further information.

Card income increased due to:

• higher net interchange income in CCB driven by an

increase in debit and credit card sales volume above pre-
pandemic levels, partially offset by the impact of a
renegotiation of a co-brand partner contract, as well as
an increase to the rewards liability, and

52

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

• higher payments revenue related to commercial card and
merchant processing in CB and CIB on higher volume,

Provision for credit losses
Year ended December 31,

partially offset by

• higher amortization related to new account origination

costs in CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66,
pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for
further information.
Other income decreased reflecting:
• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a

decline in volume, and

• increased amortization on a higher level of alternative
energy investments in the tax-oriented investment
portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more
than offset by lower income tax expense from the
associated tax credits,

predominantly offset by

• net gains on several investments, primarily in CIB and

AWM, and

• the absence of losses recorded in the prior year related to
the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-term
debt in Treasury and CIO.

Net interest income decreased driven by the impact of
lower market rates and changes in the balance sheet mix,
partially offset by balance sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2
trillion, up $436 billion, predominantly driven by higher
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield
was 1.81%, down 53 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on
these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.64%, a decrease of 34
bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.91%, down
39 bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial
measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets,
interest and rates schedule on pages 300-304 for further
details; and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 58-60 for a

Markets.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting
guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

2021 compared with 2020
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit driven by
net reductions in the allowance for credit losses.

The net benefit in consumer was driven by:

• a $9.5 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses,
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook, including $7.6 billion in Card, and $1.2 billion in
Home Lending, which also reflects continued
improvements in Home Price Index ("HPI") expectations,
and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as
consumer cash balances remained elevated;

• the prior year included a $7.4 billion net addition to the

allowance for credit losses.

The net benefit in wholesale was due to a net reduction of
$2.6 billion in the allowance for credit losses across the
LOBs, reflecting improvements in the Firm's
macroeconomic outlook. The prior year included a $4.7
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses.

Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 63-66,
CIB on pages 67-72, CB on pages 73-75, AWM on pages
76-78, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 129-131,

2021 compared with 2020
Compensation expense increased across the LOBs and
Corporate, primarily from higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, as well as the impact of investments in the
businesses.
Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher volume-related expense, including outside

services, predominantly brokerage expense in CIB and
distribution fees in AWM

• higher marketing expense predominantly driven by

higher investments in marketing campaigns and growth
in travel-related benefits in CCB

• higher other investments, including technology expense

across the LOBs

• higher contribution expense, which included a $550
million donation of equity investments to the Firm's
Foundation in the first quarter of 2021, and

• higher other structural expense, including regulatory-

related expense,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense in CCB due to lower auto

lease assets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral
values

• lower legal expense, driven by CIB and AWM, and

• the absence of an impairment recorded in the prior year

on a legacy investment in Corporate.

(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 25 for further information.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in
deposits and limited deployment opportunities in Treasury
and CIO. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements
of its excess cash with various central banks, including the
Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements decreased driven by:

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO, and lower

client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets,

partially offset by

• higher collateral requirements in CIB Markets.

Securities borrowed increased reflecting higher client-
driven activities and an increase in the demand for
securities to cover short positions in CIB Markets.

Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities
purchased under resale agreements and securities
borrowed.

Trading assets decreased reflecting;
• a lower level of securities, primarily debt instruments

related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB
Fixed Income Markets

• lower derivative receivables, primarily as a result of
market movements, as well as maturities of certain
trades in CIB, and

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Investment securities increased due to the net impact of
purchases and paydowns in the available-for-sale (“AFS”)
and held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolios, largely offset by
sales in the AFS portfolio. In the second quarter of 2021,
$104.5 billion of AFS were transferred to the HTM portfolio
for capital management purposes. Refer to Corporate
segment results on pages 79-80, Investment Portfolio Risk
Management on page 132 and Notes 2 and 10 for
additional information on investment securities.

Loans increased, reflecting:

• higher secured lending in CIB Markets; continued strength

in securities-based lending, custom lending and
mortgages in AWM; and growth in Card,

partially offset by

• a decline in CBB and CB due to the net impact of PPP loan

forgiveness and loan originations, and

• lower retained residential real estate loans in Home

Lending primarily due to net paydowns.

The allowance for loan losses decreased primarily as a
result of improvements in the macroeconomic environment.
The decline in the allowance consisted of:

• a $9.4 billion reduction in consumer, reflecting

improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,
predominantly in the credit card and residential real
estate portfolios. The residential real estate portfolio also
reflects continued improvements in HPI expectations, and

• a $2.5 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs,
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook.

Management’s discussion and analysis

There was a $148 million net reduction in the allowance for
lending-related commitments, driven by both wholesale and
consumer. This allowance is included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheets. The total net reduction in
the allowance for credit losses was $12.1 billion, as of
December 31, 2021.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
106-132, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities
primarily in CIB prime brokerage.

• higher MSRs as a result of net additions, partially offset

by the realization of expected cash flows; and

• an increase in Goodwill as a result of the acquisitions of

Nutmeg, OpenInvest, Frank, The Infatuation and Campbell
Global.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information.

Other assets increased due to the higher cash collateral
placed with central counterparties ("CCPs") in CIB, and
higher tax receivables.

Deposits increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the
effect of certain government actions in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by
growth from new and existing accounts across both
consumer and small business customers.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased
driven by lower issuances of commercial paper as a result
of lower loans in the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits in CIB, as well as maturities of credit card
securitizations in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104; and
Notes 2 and 17 for more information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements decreased due to lower
secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury
and CIO, and trading assets in CIB Markets. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 and Note 11
for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher
financing of CIB Markets activities, as well as higher
issuances of commercial paper in Treasury and CIO. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for additional
information.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for information on trading
liabilities.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting
higher client payables related to client-driven activities
primarily in CIB prime brokerage. Refer to Note 19 for
additional information.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104; and
Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on Firm-
sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances, partially
offset by fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to
higher rates, and maturities of Federal Home Loan Bank
(“FHLB”) advances. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 97-104 and Note 20 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income,
partially offset by the net impact of capital actions, and a
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income
(“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was primarily driven by the
impact of higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and
cash flow hedges. Refer to page 163 for information on
changes in stockholders’ equity, and Capital actions on page
94, Note 24 for additional information on AOCI.

Operating activities
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities.
These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk
management activities and market conditions. The Firm
believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to
meet its operating liquidity needs.
• In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading

assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities,
partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower
trading liabilities.

• In 2020, cash used primarily reflected higher trading
assets, other assets, and securities borrowed, partially
offset by higher trading liabilities and net income
excluding noncash adjustments.

Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include
originating held-for-investment loans and investing in the
investment securities portfolio, and other short-term
instruments.

• In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of
investment securities and higher net originations of
loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under
resale agreements.

• In 2020, cash used primarily reflected net purchases of
investment securities, higher net originations of loans,
and higher securities purchased under resale
agreements.

Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer
deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.

• In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net
proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially
offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements.

• In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and an
increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements, partially offset by net payments of long-term
borrowings.

• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of
common stock and cash dividends on common and
preferred stock.

Management’s discussion and analysis

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements
appear on pages 160-164. That presentation, which is
referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of
the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial
statements of other companies.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported
basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the
overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide
managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures.
The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. These financial measures allow

management to assess the comparability of revenue from
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.
These adjustments have no impact on net income as
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial
measures at the Firm and business-segment level because
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide
information to investors about the underlying operational
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular
business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore,
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to
Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP
financial measures used by the Firm may not be
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue
excluding CIB Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and
noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also
reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown
below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and
Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets,
are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews
these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s
lending, investing (including asset-liability management)
and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility
associated with CIB Markets activities. In addition,
management also assesses CIB Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur
across revenue lines. Management believes that these
measures provide investors and analysts with alternative
measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures

Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as
follows:

Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end

Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue

ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets

ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity

ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity

TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end

* Represents net income applicable to common equity

In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures
such as
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense

excluding Firmwide legal expense, and

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue

less total noninterest expense.

Management believes that these measures help investors
understand the effect of these items on reported results
and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s
performance.

The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to
period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and
conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more
meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

Management’s discussion and analysis

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e.,
total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related
deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE.
TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by
the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of customer

served, and they reflect the manner in which financial
information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 58-60 for a
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The
management reporting process that derives business
segment results includes the allocation of certain income
and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of
capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis.
The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also
provide various business metrics which are utilized by the
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing
performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business
segments may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or service, with
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by
corporate support units, or another business segment, the
costs of those services are allocated to the respective
business segments. The expense is generally
allocated based on the actual cost and use of services
provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related
to corporate support units, technology and operations not
currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to the
business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense
retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would
not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone
businesses; and other items not aligned with a particular
business segment.

Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the
Firm allocates interest income and expense to each
business segment and transfers the primary interest rate
risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO within Corporate.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest
rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities
and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest
income to the business segments.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Management’s discussion and analysis

As a result of the current interest rate environment and the
excess liquidity stemming from government and central
bank actions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities
have generally declined, impacting the business segments
net interest income. As such, during the period ended
December 31, 2021, this has resulted in lower cost of funds
for loans and margin compression on deposits across the
LOBs.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of
the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding
unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is
allocated to the reportable business segments, while the
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term
debt and preferred stock dividends to the business
segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital
requirements, as applicable. The allocated cost of
unsecured long-term debt is included in a business
segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced

by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a business
segment’s net income applicable to common equity.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for
additional information.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred
to as equity.The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates
Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the
GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe
stress environment. As of January 1, 2022, the Firm has
changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as
a result of changes in RWA for each LOB and to reflect an
increase in the Firm’s GSIB surcharge to 4.0% that will be
effective January 1, 2023. The assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically
reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs
may change from time to time.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional
information on capital allocation.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Noninterest expense was $29.3 billion, up 5%, reflecting:

• increased compensation expense, as well as investments
in technology and marketing campaigns, and growth in
travel-related benefits,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense due to lower auto lease

assets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral values.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $7.0
billion, compared with an expense of $12.3 billion in the
prior year, driven by:

• a $9.8 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses,
reflecting improvements in the Firm’s macroeconomic
outlook, consisting of $7.6 billion in Card, $675 million in
CBB, $300 million in Auto and $1.2 billion in Home
Lending, which also reflects continued improvements in
HPI expectations, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as
consumer cash balances remained elevated.

The prior year included a $7.8 billion addition to the
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
106-132 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
129-131 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

Management’s discussion and analysis

2021 compared with 2020
Net income was $20.9 billion, up $12.7 billion, driven by a
net benefit in the provision for credit losses, compared to
an expense in the prior year.

Net revenue was $50.1 billion, a decrease of 2%.

Net interest income was $32.8 billion, down 2%, driven by:

• the net impact in Card of lower revolving loans, primarily

due to higher payments, and lower funding costs,

largely offset by

• higher loans in Auto, and

• the accelerated recognition of deferred processing fees
associated with PPP loan forgiveness, largely offset by
the net impact of margin compression on higher deposits
in CBB.

Noninterest revenue was $17.3 billion, down 3%, driven
by:

• a decrease in mortgage fees and related income due to a
net loss in MSR risk management results primarily driven
by updates to model inputs related to prepayment
expectations as well as lower production margins,

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline

in volume, and

• lower overdraft fee revenue,

largely offset by

• higher asset management fees as a result of higher

average market levels and net inflows, and

• higher card income due to higher net interchange income

driven by an increase in debit and credit card sales
volume above pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by the
impact of a renegotiation of a co-brand partner contract,
an increase to the rewards liability, and higher
amortization related to new account origination costs.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and
mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Critical
Accounting Estimates on pages 150-153, and Note 6 for
additional information on card income.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting
guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for
purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are considered purchased
credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Refer to Consumer Credit
Portfolio on pages 110-116 and Note 12 for further information on PCD
loans.
(a) At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans included
$1.6 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual
loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on
each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

(b) At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S.
government agencies of $342 million, $558 million and $963 million,
respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as
permitted by regulatory guidance.

(c) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, generally excludes loans that were

under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116 for
further information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment
deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly
all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.
(d) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $5.4 billion and $19.2

billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The
Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans
because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio
on pages 108-109 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the principal balance of loans in
Home Lending, Card and Auto under payment deferral programs
offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows: (1)
$1.1 billion and $9.1 billion in Home Lending, respectively; (2) $46
million and $264 million in Card, respectively; and (3) $115 million

Management’s discussion and analysis

and $376 million in Auto, respectively. Loans that are performing
according to their modified terms are generally not considered
delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116 for
further information on consumer payment assistance activity.
(f) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the 30+ day delinquency rates

included PCD loans. The rate at December 31, 2019 was revised to
include the impact of PCI loans.

(g) At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, excluded mortgage loans
insured by U.S. government agencies of $405 million, $744 million
and $1.7 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due.
These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee.

(h) At December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $506 million of
PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

(i) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current

presentation.

Management’s discussion and analysis

2021 compared with 2020
Net income was $21.1 billion, up 24%, largely driven by a
net benefit in the provision for credit losses, compared to
an expense in the prior year.

Net revenue was $51.7 billion, up 5%.

Banking revenue was $19.8 billion, up 27%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $12.5 billion, up 41%,
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, reflecting
higher fees across products. The Firm ranked #1 for
Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Advisory fees were $4.4 billion, up 85%, driven by

increased M&A activity and wallet share gains.

– Equity underwriting fees were $4.0 billion, up 43%,
driven by a strong IPO market and wallet share gains.

– Debt underwriting fees were $5.0 billion, up 15%,
predominantly driven by an active leveraged loan
market primarily related to acquisition financing.

• Payments revenue was $6.3 billion, up 13%, and

included net gains on equity investments. Excluding these
net gains, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 5%, driven by
higher deposit balances and fees, largely offset by
deposit margin compression.

• Lending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 13%,

predominantly driven by lower net interest income,
largely offset by lower fair value losses on hedges of
accrual loans, and higher loan commitment fees.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.0 billion,
down 5%. Markets revenue was $27.4 billion, down 7%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $16.9 billion, down
19%, driven by lower revenue in Rates, Currencies &
Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing, Commodities
and Credit compared to a strong prior year, partially
offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22%,

driven by strong performance across prime brokerage,
derivatives and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 2%,
driven by growth in fees and deposits, predominantly
offset by deposit margin compression.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $250 million

predominantly driven by valuation adjustments related to
derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $25.3 billion, up 8%,
predominantly driven by higher compensation expense,
including revenue-related compensation and investments,
as well as higher volume-related brokerage expense,
partially offset by lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.2
billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with an expense of $2.7 billion in the

difference between the price at which a market participant
is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the
price at which another market participant is willing and able
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity
and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive
to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue,
which include general market conditions, such as interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity
and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic
conditions.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm
assesses its Markets business performance on a total
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line
items. For example, securities that generate net interest
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are
reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.
Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition
of these income statement line items.

Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial
instruments and commodities transactions that arise from
client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions
revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new
transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory-
related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains
and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the
Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to,
client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue
recognized upon executing new transactions with market
participants is affected by many factors including the level
of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the

(a) Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net

revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains
and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk ("VaR") measure and exclude select components of total net revenue, which may
more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on
pages 135-137.

2021 compared with 2020
Net income was $5.2 billion, up $2.7 billion, predominantly
driven by a net benefit in the provision for credit losses,
compared to an expense in the prior year.

Net revenue was $10.0 billion, up 7%. Net interest income
was $6.0 billion, down 3%, driven by the net impact of
margin compression on higher deposits and a decrease in
loans, largely offset by lower funding costs. Noninterest
revenue was $3.9 billion, up 28%, predominantly driven by
higher investment banking and payments revenue.

Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, up 6%,
predominantly driven by investments in the business,
including higher compensation expense, and higher
volume- and revenue-related expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $947
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with an expense of $2.1 billion in the
prior year.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CB product revenue consists of the following:

Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which
are primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral
includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or
other assets. Products include term loans, revolving lines of
credit, bridge financing, asset-based structures, leases, and
standby letters of credit.

Payments includes revenue from a broad range of
products and services that enable CB clients to manage
payments and receipts, as well as invest and manage
funds.

Investment banking includes revenue from a range of
products providing CB clients with sophisticated capital-
raising alternatives, as well as balance sheet and risk
management tools through advisory, equity
underwriting, and loan syndications. Revenue from Fixed
Income and Equity Markets products used by CB clients is
also included.

Other revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent
adjustments generated from Community Development
Banking and activity derived from principal transactions.

2021 compared with 2020
Net income was $4.7 billion, an increase of 58%.

Net revenue was $17.0 billion, an increase of 19%. Net
interest income was $3.9 billion, up 14%. Noninterest
revenue was $13.1 billion, up 21%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $9.2 billion, up 21%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees, net of liquidity fee

waivers, on higher average market levels and strong
cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity
products,

• higher performance fees, and

• higher net investment valuation gains.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $7.7 billion, up
17%, predominantly driven by:

• higher loans including the impact of lower funding costs,

and higher asset management fees,

partially offset by

• the net impact of margin compression on higher deposits.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $227
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with an expense of $263 million in the
prior year.

Noninterest expense was $10.9 billion, up 10%, driven by
higher volume- and revenue-related compensation expense
and distribution fees, higher structural expense, and higher
investments in the business, partially offset by lower legal
expense.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance.

Effective September 2021, AWM changed the source for the peer
group quartile rankings of its funds from Lipper to Morningstar for
U.S.-domiciled funds (except for “Municipals” and “Investor” funds,
for which the source remains Lipper) and Taiwan domiciled funds.
AWM evaluates fund performance utilizing this peer group ranking
and believes that it provides investors with comparability across the
industry. This change resulted in both positive and negative impacts
on the quartile rankings for prior periods, as compared to how they
would have been ranked by Lipper. In addition, AWM has changed its
selection of the “primary share class” for certain non-
U.S. funds, as set forth below, in order to establish a more consistent
approach across these products. Prior periods in the following table
have been revised to conform to the current presentation.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds

rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on
their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating
is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked
funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and
represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds,
separate star ratings are provided at the individual share
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-
adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of
history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All
ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other
funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the
fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds
ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All
quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values
used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is
based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share
class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong
SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance
data may have been different if all share classes had been included.
Past performance is not indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and
Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share
classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary
share class.

respectively.

(b) During the six months ended June 30, 2021, 1,155 technology and

risk management employees were transferred from Corporate to CIB.

2021 compared with 2020
Net income was a loss of $3.7 billion compared with a loss
of $1.8 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $3.5 billion, compared with a loss
of $1.2 billion in the prior year.

Net interest income decreased primarily driven by:

• limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to

significant deposit growth across the LOBs, and

• the impact of faster prepayments on mortgage-backed

securities in the first half of 2021,

partially offset by

• higher net interest income on growth in investment

securities.

Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due to:

• net investment securities losses related to repositioning
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net
gains in the prior year from sales of U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS,

• lower net valuation gains on several legacy equity

investments

partially offset by

• the absence of losses recorded in the prior year in

Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment
transactions, which were more than offset by the related
net interest income earned on these transactions, also in
the prior year, and

• the absence of losses recorded in the prior year related to
the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-term
debt in Treasury and CIO

Noninterest expense of $1.8 billion was up $429 million
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm’s
Foundation, investments related to the Firm’s international
consumer expansion, technology initiatives, and higher
legal expense, largely offset by the absence of an
impairment on a legacy investment recorded in the prior
year.

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on
the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for
credit losses.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by
changes in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes as well as
other tax adjustments, partially offset by the resolutions of
certain tax audits.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Treasury and CIO overview
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s
liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and
foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four
major reportable business segments to serve their
respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-
balance sheet assets and liabilities.

Treasury and CIO seek to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability
management objectives generally by investing in high-
quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as
part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury
and CIO also use derivatives to meet the Firm’s asset-
liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO
manage the Firm’s cash position primarily through deposits
at central banks and investments in short-term instruments.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for
further information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer to
Market Risk Management on pages 133-140 for
information on interest rate, foreign exchange and other
risks.

The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists
of U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency
mortgage-backed securities, U.S. and non-U.S. government
securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities,
other ABS and corporate debt securities. At December 31,
2021, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio,
net of allowance for credit losses, was $670.1 billion, and
the average credit rating of the securities comprising the
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available and, where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further
information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio
and internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects
the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires,
among other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate;
and

•

Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of
risks, and impacts of risks.

Drivers of Risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers
of risks include the economic environment, regulatory and
government policy, competitor and market evolution,
business decisions, process and judgment error, deliberate
wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.

Types of Risks are categories by which risks manifest
themselves. Risks are generally categorized in the following
four risk types:

•

•

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed
business plans or inadequate response to changes in the
operating environment.

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the
default or change in credit profile of a client,
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a
reduction in expected returns on investments, including

consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and
investment portfolio risk.

• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of

changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and
liabilities held for both the short and long term.

• Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes or systems; human factors; or external events
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. It includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model
risk.

Impacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both
quantitative and qualitative. There may be many
consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative
impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital,
liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative
impacts such as reputation damage, loss of clients and
customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.

The Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is
managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent
Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which consists of the
Risk Management and Compliance organizations. The Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by
the Risk Committee of the Board (“Board Risk Committee”),
the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM
organization and manage the risk governance structure of
the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board
Risk Committee in the form of the Risk Governance and
Oversight Policy. The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates
authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”),
and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who each
establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations,
set the Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and
define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk
governance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks that
arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk areas that span
across the individual LOBs, functions and regions.

Three lines of defense
The Firm relies upon each area of the Firm giving rise to
risk to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM
function, and within its own management-identified risk and
control standards.

Each LOB and Treasury & CIO, including their aligned
Operations, Technology and Control Management, are the
Firm’s “first line of defense” and own the identification of
risks, as well as the design and execution of controls to
manage those risks. The first line of defense is responsible
for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and
for the implementation of the risk management structure
(which may include policy, standards, limits, thresholds and
controls) established by IRM.

81

Management’s discussion and analysis

The IRM function is independent of the businesses and is
the Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM function
independently assesses and challenges the first line of
defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible
for its own adherence to applicable laws, rules and
regulations and for the implementation of policies and
standards established by IRM with respect to its own
processes.

Internal Audit is an independent function that provides
objective assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of
Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk
management as the “third line of defense.” The Internal
Audit Function is headed by the General Auditor, who
reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the
CEO.

In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the
Firmwide control environment but are not considered part
of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human
Resources and Legal, and are responsible for adherence to
applicable laws, rules and regulations and policies and
standards established by IRM with respect to their own
processes.

Risk identification and ownership
Each LOB and Corporate owns the ongoing identification of
risks, as well as the design and execution of controls,
including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To
support this activity, the Firm has a formal Risk
Identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB
and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks
inherent to the Firm, catalog them in a central repository
and review the most material risks on a regular basis. The
IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and
Corporate’s identified risks, maintains the central
repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results
to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and Board Risk
Committee.

Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk
Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks.
Periodically the Firm’s risk appetite is set and approved by
senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and
approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and
qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the
Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk
appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board
Risk Committee.

82

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues to
senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.

The chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the
Firm’s risk governance structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and paths of escalation that support the
oversight of risk which are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.

The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the
Firm’s CEO, CRO, CFO, General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs
and other senior executives, is accountable to and may
refer matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The
Operating Committee is responsible for escalating to the
Board the information necessary to facilitate the Board’s
exercise of its duties.

Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business
and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s
financial performance and condition and reviewing the
strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries
out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities
through its independent, principal standing committees.
The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the
control environment, and the Compensation & Management
Development Committee oversees compensation and other
management-related matters. Each committee of the Board
oversees reputational risks and conduct risks within its
scope of responsibility.

The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is
responsible for the oversight of management of the bank.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes this
function acting directly and through the principal standing
committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and
control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is
primarily the responsibility of the Risk Committee and the

Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to
compensation and other management-related matters, the
Compensation & Management Development Committee.

The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight
of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk
management framework reasonably designed to identify,
assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable
primary risk policies and review of certain associated
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by
management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters,
issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm,
including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk
Committee, as appropriate.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an
effective system of controls reasonably designed to
safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the
integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain
compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans
and procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also
assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s independent
registered public accounting firm’s qualifications,
independence and performance, and of the performance of
the Firm’s Internal Audit function.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

83

Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees
oversee the operational risk and control environment of
their respective business or function, inclusive of
Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of
that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators
of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may
impact the level of operating risk in a business or function,
addressing key operational risk issues, with an emphasis on
processes with control concerns and overseeing control
remediation.

The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management
(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting
the management of liquidity risk, balance sheet, interest
rate risk, and capital risk.

The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is
responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising
from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.

Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and
oversight functions. The scope of a particular function may
include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk.
For example, Country Risk Management oversees country
risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of
exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as
credit or market risk.

The following sections discuss the risk governance and
oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in
the Firm’s business activities.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The Compensation & Management Development Committee
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews
and approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified
benefits programs. The Committee reviews the performance
of Operating Committee members against their goals, and
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s
award is subject to ratification by the independent directors
of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of
and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s
role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the
“tone at the top”, the CMDC provides oversight of the Firm’s
culture, including reviewing updates from management
regarding significant conduct issues and any related actions
with respect to employees, including compensation actions.

The Public Responsibility Committee provides oversight and
review of the Firm's positions and practices on public
responsibility matters such as community investment, fair
lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public
policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character
and could impact the Firm's reputation among its
stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on
these matters to management and the Board, as
appropriate.

The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee
exercises general oversight with respect to the governance
of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of
and recommends to the Board of Directors proposed
nominees for election to the Board. The Committee
evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate
governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also
appraises the framework for assessing the Board’s
performance and self-evaluation.

Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are
primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:

The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest
management-level risk committee. It provides oversight of
the risks inherent in the Firm’s businesses and serves as an
escalation point for risk topics and issues raised by
underlying committees and/or FRC members.

The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation
committee for senior management to review and discuss
the Firmwide operational risk environment including
identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant
events that have been escalated.

Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are
responsible for providing oversight of the governance,
limits, and controls that are in place within the scope of
their respective activities. These committees review the
ways in which the particular LOB or the business operating
in a particular region could be exposed to adverse
outcomes with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating
and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these
committees.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed
business plans or inadequate response to changes in the
operating environment.

Management and oversight
The Operating Committee and the senior leadership of each
LOB and Corporate are responsible for managing the Firm’s
most significant strategic risks. Strategic risks are overseen
by IRM through participation in relevant business reviews,
LOB and Corporate senior management meetings, risk and
control committees and other relevant governance forums
and ongoing discussions. The Board of Directors oversees
management’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk
Committee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk management
framework.

In the process of developing business plans and strategic
initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify
the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide
Risk Identification process and their impact on risk appetite.

In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the
LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their
impact on the risk profile of the Firm.

The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the
development and execution of strategic initiatives, is one
component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. Guided by
the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”),
the Operating Committee and senior management teams in
each LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic
plan periodically. The process includes evaluating the high-
level strategic framework and performance against prior-
year initiatives, assessing the operating environment,
refining existing strategies and developing new strategies.

These strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s assessment, are
incorporated in the Firm’s budget and provided to the
Board as part of its review and approval of the Firm’s
strategic plan.

The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-
adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also
a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to
Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for further
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 97-104 for further information on
liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk Management on page
105 for further information on reputation risk.

Management’s discussion and analysis

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business
activities and associated risks during normal economic
environments and under stressed conditions.

A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong
balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is
considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of
Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s
fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted
returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s
capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining
long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in
market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed
environments. Senior management considers the
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant
decisions that could impact future business activities. In
addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior
management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with
a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.

Capital management oversight
The Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function
whose primary objective is to provide independent
oversight of capital risk across the Firm.

Capital Management Oversight’s responsibilities include:

• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;

•

Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk
limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report

capital limit breaches;

• Performing an assessment of the Firm’s capital

management activities, including changes made to the
Contingency Capital Plan described below; and

•

Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital
framework intended to ensure compliance with
applicable regulatory capital rules.

Capital management
Treasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.

The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management
are to:

• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build
and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle
and in stressed environments;

• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment

opportunities;

• Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of

strength to its subsidiaries;

•

Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory
capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized”
status for the Firm and its insured depository institution
(“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable
regulatory capital requirements;

• Meet capital distribution objectives; and

• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate

throughout a resolution period in accordance with the
Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.

The Firm addresses these objectives through:

•

Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and
maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The
internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s
regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal
assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic
cycles and in stress events;

• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of

potential events; and

• Regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and
following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the
Firm and material legal entity levels.

Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital
management include the Capital Governance Committee,
the ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, and the CIO,
Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In
addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the
Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk
Management on pages 81-84 for additional discussion on
the ALCO and other risk-related committees.

Capital planning and stress testing

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at least
annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and
approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve
uses CCAR and other stress testing processes to ensure that
large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of
economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-
looking capital assessment and planning processes in place
that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb
losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the
Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and
internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”),
as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as
dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal
Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario
from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s
Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming
year.

On June 28, 2021, JPMorgan Chase announced that it had
completed the 2021 CCAR stress test process. On August 5,
2021, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2021 SCB
requirement of 3.2% (down from 3.3%) and the Firm's
Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement including
regulatory buffers, of 11.2% (down from 11.3%). The
2021 SCB requirement became effective on October 1,
2021 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2022.

86

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Refer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the
2021 CCAR results.

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the
Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s
processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as
well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital
planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates
stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving
the capital stress testing control framework.

Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative
economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings
and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters
underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and
applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios
are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which
are key drivers of business results; global market shocks,
which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are
intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and
idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and
other periodic stress testing, management also considers
tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as
necessary.

Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital
management framework for the Firm and specifies the
principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital
management in normal economic conditions and during
stress. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm
calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum
capital requirements, monitors the ongoing
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets
out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be
taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion
during a period of stress.

Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated
financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s
IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital
Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to
time.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the
Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by
calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-
balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures,

weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches
are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based
capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated
against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced
approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital
ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-
based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III
Advanced risk-based ratios.

Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating
credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of
Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in
the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized
and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which
largely rely on the use of internal credit models and
parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk
RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings
which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class.
Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent
basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.
In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches,
the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate
management judgment and feedback from its regulators.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to
calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding
than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to
SLR on page 93 for additional information.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition. The Firm elected to apply
the CECL capital transition provisions as permitted by the
federal banking agencies which delayed the effects of CECL
on regulatory capital for two years until January 1, 2022,
followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital
transition provisions”).

As of December 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm
reflected the benefit of the CECL capital transition
provisions of $2.9 billion, which will be phased in at 25%
per year beginning January 1, 2022.

The CECL capital transition provisions have also been
incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
and total leverage exposure and are also subject to the
three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022.

Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL
accounting guidance.

Paycheck Protection Program. The federal banking agencies
issued a final rule in September 2020 to neutralize the
regulatory capital effects of participating in the PPP on risk-
based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk weight
to loans originated under the program. The Firm does not

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

87

Management’s discussion and analysis

expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans
because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. As of
December 31, 2021, the Firm had $6.7 billion of loans
remaining under the program.

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending
Facility, which would have allowed the Firm to exclude them
under the final rule.

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”) debt instruments by certain
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expanded the scope of the prior
capital deductions rule relating to the holdings of capital
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021
and did not have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based
capital metrics.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. In
November 2019, the U.S. banking regulators adopted a rule
implementing “Standardized Approach for Counterparty
Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced the current
exposure method used to measure derivatives counterparty
exposure under Standardized approach RWA, as well as
leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the
regulatory capital framework. The rule applies to Basel III
Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with a mandatory
compliance date of January 1, 2022.

Based on the derivatives exposure as of December 31,
2021, the adoption of SA-CCR is estimated to increase the
Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion and
result in a modest decrease in its total leverage
exposure. These estimates may differ from the actual
impact based on the composition of the Firm’s derivatives
exposure as of March 31, 2022.

88

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements

The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.

All banking institutions are currently required to have a
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted
assets.

Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are
required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a
“capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation
buffer incorporates a global systemically important bank
(“GSIB”) surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital
buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for
Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a variable
SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized
regulatory capital requirements.

Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required
to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two
separately prescribed methods based on data for the
previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the
two. “Method 1”, reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed
by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is
calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across
five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability.
“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1
requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale
funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB
score “multiplication factor”.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

89

Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced
approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of
3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm,
are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage
buffer.

The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided
by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage
exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average
on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be
deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance
sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and
derivatives potential future exposure.

Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the
regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well
as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.

Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of
Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also
maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be
“well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”)
requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”),
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.

Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios,
as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to
which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to
the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports,
which are available on the Firm’s website, for further
information on the Firm’s Basel III measures.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB
surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2021 and
2020. For 2022, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge under
both Method 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at 2.0%
and 3.5%, respectively.

 2.0  %

 3.5  %

2021

 2.0  %

 3.5  %

2020

On November 23, 2021, the FSB released its annual GSIB
list based upon data as of December 31, 2020, which
announced the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5%
(up from 2.0%) effective January 1, 2023, unless the
Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge, as determined by the FSB,
is lower based upon data as of December 31, 2021.

The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of
December 31, 2020 is 4.0%, which will be effective
January 1, 2023. The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge
calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%.
Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the
Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to
4.5% on January 1, 2024 unless the Firm’s Method 2 GSIB
surcharge calculation based upon data as of December 31,
2022 is lower.

The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a
framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital
buffer taking into account the macro financial environment
in which large, internationally active banks function. As of
December 31, 2021, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer
remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to
review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be
increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine
that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can
be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a
12-month implementation period.

Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess
of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the
capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge)
and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to
the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well
as certain executive discretionary bonus payments.

The Firm believes that it will operate with a Basel III
Standardized CET1 capital ratio between 12.0% and 13.0%
in the near term, based on the Basel III capital rules
currently in effect, and with consideration for an increase in
the GSIB surcharge in 2023.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-
tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term
debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for
additional information.

Line of business equity
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for
expected returns are established as key measures of a
business segment’s performance.

The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB
surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress
environment. As of January 1, 2022, the Firm has changed
its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of
changes in RWA for each LOB and to reflect an increase in
the Firm’s GSIB surcharge to 4.0% that will be effective
January 1, 2023. The assumptions and methodologies used
to allocate capital are periodically reassessed and as a
result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change from
time to time.
The following table presents the capital allocated to each
business segment.

The Board of Director’s authorization to repurchase
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and
the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common
shares that may be repurchased is subject to various
factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory
considerations affecting the amount and timing of
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital
generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The
repurchase program does not include specific price targets
or timetables; may be suspended by management at any
time; and may be executed through open market purchases
or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule
10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm
may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm
to repurchase its common shares during periods when it
may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for
example, during internal trading blackout periods.

Common stock
On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021.
Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase
program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal
Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends
in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and
could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for
the four preceding calendar quarters.

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the
temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire
on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the
2021 CCAR stress test. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm
became subject to the normal capital distribution
restrictions provided under the regulatory capital
framework. The Firm continues to be authorized to
repurchase common shares under its existing common
share repurchase program previously approved by the
Board of Directors.

Refer to capital planning and stress testing on pages 86-87
for additional information.

Other capital requirements

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-
tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term
debt.

The external TLAC requirements and the minimum level of
eligible long-term debt requirements are shown below:

(a) RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to their

respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.

Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the
regulatory minimum plus applicable buffers will result in
limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may
distribute, such as through dividends and common share
repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary
bonus payments.

The following table presents the eligible external TLAC and
eligible LTD amounts, as well as a representation of the

Broker-dealer regulatory capital

J.P. Morgan Securities
JPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is
J.P. Morgan Securities. J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to
Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Net Capital Rule”). J.P. Morgan Securities is also
registered as a futures commission merchant and is subject
to regulatory capital requirements, including those imposed
by the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”)
and the National Futures Association (“NFA”).

J.P. Morgan Securities has elected to compute its minimum
net capital requirements in accordance with the
“Alternative Net Capital Requirements” of the Net Capital
Rule.

J.P. Morgan Securities registered with the SEC as a security-
based swap dealer effective November 1, 2021 and
continues to be registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer.
As a result of additional SEC and CFTC capital and financial
reporting requirements for security-based swap dealers and
swap dealers, J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to alternative
minimum net capital requirements and required to hold
“tentative net capital” in excess of $5.0 billion (up from
$1.0 billion). J.P. Morgan Securities is also required to
notify the SEC and CFTC in the event that its tentative net
capital is less than $6.0 billion (up from $5.0 billion).
Tentative net capital is net capital before deducting market
and credit risk charges as defined by the Net Capital Rule.
As of December 31, 2021, J.P. Morgan Securities
maintained tentative net capital in excess of the minimum
and notification requirements.

J.P. Morgan Securities plc
J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and has authority to engage in
banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities.
J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K.
Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial
Conduct Authority (“FCA”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is
subject to the European Union Capital Requirements
Regulation, as adopted in the U.K., and the PRA capital

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support
its assets and liabilities.

Liquidity risk oversight
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Oversight function whose
primary objective is to provide oversight of liquidity risk
across the Firm. Liquidity Risk Oversight’s responsibilities
include:

• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;

•

Independently establishing and monitoring limits and
indicators, including liquidity risk appetite;

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report

limit breaches;

• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk

management processes;

• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal

entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics,
as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances
and funding activities; and

• Approving or escalating for review new or updated

liquidity stress assumptions.

Liquidity management
Treasury & CIO is responsible for liquidity management.

The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management
are to:

•

Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material
legal entities are able to operate in support of client
needs and meet contractual and contingent financial
obligations through normal economic cycles as well as
during stress events, and

• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of

liquidity sources.

The Firm addresses these objectives through:
• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics
of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal
entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and
operational restrictions;

• Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;

• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-
specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and
contingency funding plans;

• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity

risk appetite tolerances and limits;

• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements

related to funding and liquidity risk; and

•

Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity
characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as
well as certain off-balance sheet items.

As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy,
the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized,
global approach designed to:

•

•

•

•

Optimize liquidity sources and uses;

Monitor exposures;

Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between
the Firm’s legal entities; and

Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at
a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.

Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the
Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the
Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In
addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and
recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval,
the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and
liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on
pages 81-84 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-
related committees.

Internal stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm
has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios,
including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution
and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s
material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress
tests are performed in response to specific market events
or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s
contractual financial obligations are met and take into
consideration:

• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured

funding markets;

•

Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash
outflows; and

• Potential impediments to the availability and

transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other
restrictions.

Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range
of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate
both market and idiosyncratic stresses.

Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of
the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity
position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding
for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances,
and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”) provides funding support to the
ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its
subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent
Company, IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient
to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum
liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of

Management’s discussion and analysis

stress when access to normal funding sources may be
disrupted.

Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the
strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource
needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates
liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances.
The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding
and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal
entities in a period of stress.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over
a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress.
Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the
amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain
operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA
primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid
securities as defined in the LCR rule.

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-
alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from
the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.

Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized
stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule,
which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets,
sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a
minimum of 100%.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended
December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020 based on the Firm’s interpretation of
the LCR framework.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months
ended December 31, 2021, compared with the prior year
period primarily due to long-term debt issuances.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during
the three months ended December 31, 2021, compared
with both the three month periods ended September 30,
2021 and December 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in
deposits. The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under
the LCR rule.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of
ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities,
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity.
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was
approximately $914 billion and $740 billion as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, although the
amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular
time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.
The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020,
due to an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased
deposits.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a
result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of
approximately $308 billion and $307 billion as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This borrowing
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities
reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve
Bank discount window and other central banks. Although
available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at
the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year
horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies
issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking
organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. are required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% on
an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule became effective on
July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually
beginning in 2023.

As of December 31, 2021, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR,
based on the Firm’s current understanding of the final rule.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and
off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short-
and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term
secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The
Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from
long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured
borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid
investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk
characteristics.

Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance
sheet obligations.

Deposits

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of
liquidity because they are generated from customers that
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.
Furthermore, certain deposits are covered by insurance
protection that provides additional funding stability and
results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection
may be available to depositors in the countries in which the
deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance
protection for deposits placed in a U.S. Depository
Institution. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firmwide
estimated uninsured deposits were $1,489.6 billion and
$1,275.9 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting
wholesale operating deposits.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during
periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the year ended
December 31, 2021, reflecting significant inflows across
the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain
government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from existing
and new accounts across both consumer and small business
customers.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment
Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on
pages 61-80 and pages 55-56, respectively, for further
information on deposit and liability balance trends.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased
at December 31, 2021, compared with December 31,
2020, due to lower secured financing of AFS investment
securities in Treasury and CIO, and trading assets in CIB
Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in
commercial paper at December 31, 2021, from
December 31, 2020 was due to higher net issuance
primarily for short-term liquidity management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at
December 31, 2021 from December 31, 2020, and for the
average year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the
prior year period, was primarily due to net issuances of
structured notes.

102

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in
support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding
proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Refer to

The cost and availability of financing are influenced by
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it

maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and
credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on
the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and
collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021
were as follows:

(a) On July 12, 2021, Moody’s revised the outlook of the Parent Company’s long-term issuer rating from stable to positive. The outlook for the Parent

Company’s short-term issuer rating and the Firm's principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries remained unchanged at stable.

(b) On May 24, 2021, Standard & Poor's affirmed the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and

revised the outlook from stable to positive.

(c) On April 23, 2021, Fitch affirmed the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and revised the

outlook from negative to stable.

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain
requirements that would call for an acceleration of
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the
existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings
or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios,
earnings, or stock price.

Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a
stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and
liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management
controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies
continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends,
regulatory developments, future profitability, risk
management practices, and litigation matters, as well as
their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit
ratings.

Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the
principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is
the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate
to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding
whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or
client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a
business process or consider any other activity.
Sustainability, social responsibility and environmental
impacts are important considerations in assessing the
Firm’s reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s
reputation risk governance.

Reputation risk issues deemed material are escalated as
appropriate.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may
negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and
reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various
constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers,
investors, regulators, employees, communities or the
broader public.

Organization and management
Reputation Risk Management establishes the governance
framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s
LOBs and Corporate. As reputation risk is inherently
challenging to identify, manage, and quantify, a reputation
risk management function is particularly important.

The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes
the following activities:
•

Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance
policy and standard consistent with the reputation risk
framework

•

Overseeing the governance execution through
processes and infrastructure that support consistent
identification, escalation, management and monitoring
of reputation risk issues Firmwide

The types of events that result in reputation risk are wide-
ranging and may be introduced by the Firm’s employees
and the clients, customers and counterparties with which
the Firm does business. These events could result in
financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as
other harm to the Firm.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The
Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from
large corporate and institutional clients to individual
consumers and small businesses. In its consumer
businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily
through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients
and counterparties, as well as through its operating services
activities (such as cash management and clearing
activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is
also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities
portfolio and cash placed with banks.

Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages
credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk
policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management
governance includes the following activities:

• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework

• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across

all portfolio segments, including transaction and
exposure approval

• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines

• Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection

with the approval of credit exposure

• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and

• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate

credit risk-based capital management

Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or
counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit
risk vary depending on several factors, including type of
asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement
parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit
score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management
and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center
versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk
measurement is based on the probability of default of an
obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default
event and the exposure at default.

Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates
described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit
losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses
reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and
wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the
allowance for lending-related commitments reflects
estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related
commitments and the allowance for investment securities
reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment
securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical
Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 150-153
for further information.

In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and
represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to
the established allowances for loan losses and lending-
related commitments. The analyses for these losses include
stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios
as described below.

Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing
process assesses the potential impact of alternative
economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses
for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying
parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of
macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses.
The stress test results may indicate credit migration,
changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the
credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing
processes, management also considers additional stresses
outside these scenarios, including industry and country-
specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress
testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a
Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress
on individual counterparties.

106

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent
Credit Review function is responsible for:

• Independently validating or changing the risk grades
assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit
portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade
changes initiated by responsible business units; and

• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management
processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the
adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given
default (“LGD”) rationales, proper monitoring and
management of credit exposures, and compliance with
applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.

Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and
wholesale loans.

Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-
making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts,
concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported
regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management.
Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients,
counterparties and customers, product and geography are
prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for
credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on
a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and
governance structure, credit risk trends and limit
exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with,
risk committees, senior management and the Board of
Directors.

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are
designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the
approval and decision-making process for extending credit
to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved
properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both
the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework
establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits,
risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in
evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently
validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.

Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and
other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio
level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through
changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines.
Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and
other trends against business expectations, current and
forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks.
Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends
are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer
credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit
risk profile of the portfolio.

Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate
portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty
level with established concentration limits that are
reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate
by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as
measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite,
are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk
is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively
correlated with the impact of a default by the same
counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the
same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its
obligations is decreasing.

Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is
accomplished through a number of means, including:

• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes

• Loan syndications and participations

• Loan sales and securitizations

• Credit derivatives

• Master netting agreements, and

• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques

Customer and client assistance
The Firm provided various forms of assistance to customers
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The
majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications
have not been considered troubled debt restructurings
(“TDRs”). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19
pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies,
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers
and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due
or nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on
pages 110-116 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages
117-128 for information on loan modifications as of
December 31, 2021. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for further
information on the Firm’s accounting policies for loan
modifications and the allowance for credit losses.

Paycheck Protection Program
The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented by
the SBA, provided the Firm with delegated authority to
process and originate PPP loans. When certain criteria are
met, PPP loans are subject to forgiveness and the Firm will
receive payment of the forgiveness amount from the SBA.
PPP loans have a contractual term of two or five years and
provide borrowers with an automatic payment deferral of
principal and interest. The SBA will pay accrued interest
through the payment deferral period and additional interest
up to a maximum of 120 days past due. Based upon these
servicing guidelines, the Firm continues to accrue interest
for PPP loans 90 or more days past due until delinquency
reaches 120 days past due. PPP processing fees are
deferred and accreted into interest income over the
contractual life of the loans, but may be accelerated upon
forgiveness or prepayment.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had $6.7 billion
and $27.2 billion, respectively, of PPP loans, including $5.4
billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, in consumer, and
$1.3 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, in wholesale. The
PPP ended for new applications on May 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately $34 billion of
PPP loans have been repaid through payments of
forgiveness amounts to the Firm from the SBA. During the
year ended December 31, 2021, this resulted in
accelerated recognition in interest income of the associated
deferred processing fees, primarily in CCB.

At December 31, 2021, $633 million of PPP loans 90 or
more days past due have been excluded from the Firm’s
nonaccrual loans as they are guaranteed by the SBA.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66 and Note 12
for a further discussion of the PPP.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of
residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto
and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-
related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving
primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market.
Originated mortgage loans are retained in the residential
real estate portfolio, securitized or sold to U.S. government
agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other
types of consumer loans are typically retained on the
balance sheet. The credit performance of the consumer
portfolio, including net charge-offs continued to benefit from
the improvement in the macroeconomic environment during
2021. Refer to Note 12 for further information on the
consumer loan portfolio. Refer to Note 28 for further

predominantly in residential real estate, compared to
approximately $28.3 billion at June 30, 2020. During the
fourth quarter of 2021, there were approximately $386
million of new enrollments in consumer payment deferral
programs. Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment
deferral programs are current. The Firm continues to
monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to
payment deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an
ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume
making regularly scheduled payments, and considers
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these
loans in its allowance for credit losses.

Of the $1.3 billion of retained loans under payment deferral
programs as of December 31, 2021, approximately $611
million were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral
and approximately $40 million were accounted for as TDRs
because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not elect to
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided
by the CARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act and which expired on January 1, 2022.
Borrowers that are unable to resume or continue making
payments in accordance with the original or modified
contractual terms of their agreements upon exit from
deferral programs will be placed on nonaccrual status in line
with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit cards as
permitted by regulatory guidance, and the loans charged off
or down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies.
Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the Firm’s
nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-
value ratio of residential real estate loans
At December 31, 2021, $145.5 billion, or 65% of the total
retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding
mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies, were
concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and
Illinois, compared with $146.6 billion, or 65% at
December 31, 2020.
Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios
have declined consistent with recent improvements in home
prices and customer pay-downs.

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic
composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s
residential real estate loans.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased from December 31, 2020 driven by higher
residential real estate loans at fair value, largely offset by
lower auto and other loans.

The following discussions provide information concerning
individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further
information about this portfolio, including information
about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit
quality indicators.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans were relatively flat compared to
December 31, 2020 as the decline in Home Lending driven
by paydowns outpacing originations of prime mortgage
loans was predominantly offset by growth in AWM. Retained
nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2020
reflecting improved credit performance. Net recoveries for
the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher when
compared with the prior year as the current year benefited
from further improvement in HPI and higher reversals of
prior write-downs due to prepayments as a result of the low
rate environment.
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2020,
reflecting loan purchase activity in CIB driven by higher
client demand, as well as increased originations in Home
Lending due to the continued low rate environment.
Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from
December 31, 2020 due to sales in CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit
outstanding was $18.7 billion at December 31, 2021. This
amount included $6.2 billion of HELOCs that have recast
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have
been modified and $6.0 billion of interest-only balloon
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of
interest-only residential mortgage loans were $30.0 billion
and $25.6 billion, respectively. These loans have an
interest-only payment period generally followed by an
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly
in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan
portfolio reflected net recoveries for the year ended
December 31, 2021, in line with the performance of the
broader prime mortgage portfolio.

the government guarantee.

(b) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that
have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90
or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered
collateral-dependent at time of exit.

PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Modified residential real estate loans
The following table presents information relating to
modified retained residential real estate loans for which
concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified
PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions and,
therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has
elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the
option provided by the CARES Act. Refer to Note 12 for
further information on modifications for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020.

were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 for additional
information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual
status.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as
well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared
with December 31, 2020 due to a decrease in business
banking loans largely offset by growth in the scored auto
portfolio. Business Banking loans declined predominantly
due to PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by originations.
The increase in the scored auto portfolio was driven by loan
originations predominantly offset by paydowns. Net charge-
offs for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased
when compared to the prior year driven by lower scored
auto charge-offs as the current year benefited from higher
vehicle collateral values and elevated consumer cash
balances, partially offset by higher overdraft charge-offs.
The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.04%
and 0.25% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and
2020, respectively.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2020
reflecting strong sales volume predominantly offset by
higher payments. The December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+
day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50%, respectively,
decreased compared to the December 31, 2020 30+ and
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%,
respectively. The delinquency rates continue to benefit from
the ongoing impact of government stimulus and support
provided to borrowers who participated in payment
assistance programs. Net charge-offs decreased for the
year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the prior
year reflecting lower charge-offs and higher recoveries as
consumer cash balances remained elevated.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans
typically remain on accrual status until charged off.
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further
information about this portfolio, including information
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2021, $70.5 billion, or 46% of the total
retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared
with $65.0 billion, or 45%, at December 31, 2020. Refer to
Note 12 for additional information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At December 31, 2021, the Firm had $1.0 billion of credit
card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs,
which does not include loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs,
compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer to
Note 12 for additional information about loan modification
programs to borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and
counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities),
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the
loans that it originates into the market as part of its
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry
discussion on pages 119-123 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In 2021 the credit environment continued to improve
following the broad-based deterioration during the earlier
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of December 31, 2021, retained loans increased
$45.4 billion driven by CIB and AWM, partially offset by
decreases in CCB. Lending-related commitments increased
$36.6 billion, predominantly driven by net portfolio activity
in CB and CIB, including an increase in held for sale
commitments intended to be syndicated.

As of December 31, 2021, the investment-grade
percentage of the portfolio remained relatively flat at 71%,
while criticized exposure decreased $3.4 billion from $41.6
billion to $38.2 billion. The decrease in criticized exposure
was driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific
upgrades, primarily in Oil & Gas and Automotive, largely
offset by client-specific downgrades. Nonperforming
exposure decreased $1.2 billion driven by lower
nonperforming loans, primarily in Oil & Gas and Individuals
and Individual Entities, with net portfolio activity and client-
specific upgrades partially offset by client-specific
downgrades. The decrease in nonperforming loans was
partially offset by increases in derivatives and lending-
related commitments.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Wholesale assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to
clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals and
covenant modifications.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had
approximately $107 million and $1.6 billion, respectively,
of retained loans under payment deferral programs,
compared to $16.8 billion at June 30, 2020. Predominantly
all clients that exited deferral are current or have paid
down their loans. The Firm continues to monitor the credit
risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout
the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the
borrowers are required to resume making regularly
scheduled payments, and considers expected losses of

principal and accrued interest on these loans in its
allowance for credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of
covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both
payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are
generally not reported as TDRs, either because the
modifications were insignificant or they qualified to
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option
provided by the CARES Act, as extended by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act and which expired on January 1, 2022.
Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in
accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management
framework. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of
these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to
BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining
the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against
certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual

maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31, 2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow
profile or changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful
categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-
for-sale and loans at fair value, was $38.2 billion at
December 31, 2021 and $41.6 billion at December 31,
2020, representing approximately 3.5% and 4.0% of total
wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The decrease in
criticized exposure was driven by net portfolio activity and
client-specific upgrades, primarily in Oil & Gas and
Automotive, largely offset by client-specific downgrades.
The $38.2 billion of criticized exposure at December 31,
2021 was largely undrawn and $35.0 billion was
performing.

Real Estate
Real Estate exposure was $155.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, of which $89.2 billion was multifamily lending as shown in
the table below. Criticized exposure increased by $455 million from $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020 to $5.3 billion at
December 31, 2021, driven by client-specific downgrades predominantly offset by client-specific upgrades and net portfolio
activity.

contractual amounts of these financial instruments
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to
Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis,
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These
receivables are reported within accrued interest and
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance
sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in
interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions
from its market-making activities, including the
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables.
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own
credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the
counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed.
For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of
the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded
derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and
cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the
Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant
CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit
risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the
use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC
derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements —
excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not
typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short

maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily —
was approximately 88% at both December 31, 2021 and
2020. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the
Firm’s use of collateral agreements. Refer to Note 5 for a
further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties
and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets were $57.1 billion and $75.4
billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The
decrease was primarily driven by market movements and
maturities of certain trades in CIB, partially offset by an
increase in commodity derivatives. Derivative receivables
represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash
collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and
may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the
definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition
of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current
credit risk should also take into consideration other
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but
that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral
amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net
derivative receivables for the counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods

management process for derivatives exposures takes into
consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which
is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a
counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a
default by the same counterparty, which could cause
exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors
may influence the nature and magnitude of these
correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations
are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with
a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages
exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit
derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign
exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.

The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s
current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as
calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three
measures generally show that exposure will decline after
the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Exposure profile of derivatives measures
December 31, 2021
(in billions)

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net
fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the
potential future variability of that credit exposure. To
capture the potential future variability of credit exposure,
the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three
measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak,
Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure
(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and
collateral benefits, where applicable.

Peak represents a conservative measure of potential
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a
counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly
equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the
transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm
for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior
management reporting and derivatives exposure
management.

DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a
basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan
exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential
credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for
aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and
other credit risk.

Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the
Firm’s derivative exposure, including the benefit of
collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of
the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for
pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital
and CVA, as further described below.

The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the
credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk
management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit
risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio
management activities”). Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from
certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making
businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in
credit portfolio management activities.

current presentation.

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management
activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S.
GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with
gains and losses recognized in principal transactions
revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related
commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an
accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment,
between loans and lending-related commitments and the
credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in
value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.

The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge
against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a
number of factors, including the named reference entity
(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures
that are different than the named reference entities in the
purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which
may have a defined credit event that does not align with an
actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter
than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally
seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date
that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the
exposure for which the protection was purchased, and
remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored
and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in
Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and
derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for
credit losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which is recognized within Investment Securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021
was $18.7 billion, a decrease from $30.8 billion at
December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for
credit losses was primarily driven by improvements in the
macroeconomic environment, consisting of:

• a $9.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in

the credit card portfolio; and

• a $2.6 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the
Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse
and upside scenarios compared to the significant weighting
that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of
December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained improvement
and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition,
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic
caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used
for modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues to
place reliance on management judgment and make
adjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser
extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit losses of
$18.7 billion reflects remaining uncertainties, including the
potential impact that additional waves or variants of
COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and
near-term supply chain disruptions.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio
or from principal investments. The investment securities
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in
connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability
management objectives. Principal investments are
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are
typically intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists
of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2021, the
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of
allowance for credit losses, was $670.1 billion, and the
average credit rating of the securities comprising the
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on
pages 79-80 and Note 10 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 133-140 for
further information on the market risk inherent in the
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
97-104 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk
Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk
Committee with regular updates to the Board Risk
Committee.

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of
investment securities in accordance with relevant policies.
Approved levels for investment securities are established
for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial
instruments representing ownership interests or other
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance
sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to
support underserved communities and minority-owned
businesses. The aggregate carrying values of the principal
investment portfolios have not been significantly affected
by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent
with the Firm’s risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk
policy framework exists for all principal investing activities
and includes approval by executives who are independent
from the investing businesses, as appropriate.

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of
investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of
the risk governance structure, approved levels for
investments are established and monitored for each
relevant business or segment in order to manage the
overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress
testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that
estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or
other risk events.

132

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews
and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is
responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these
risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been
reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk
Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs
and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established
limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.

Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk
Management and senior management. In the event of a
breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior
members of appropriate groups within the Firm to
determine the suitable course of action required to return
the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a
reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting
a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected
increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain
Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as
appropriate.

Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 149.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate
those measures accordingly over time.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held
for both the short and long term.

Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout
the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures.

Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate
efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s
market risk profile for senior management, the Board of
Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is
responsible for the following functions:

• Maintaining a market risk policy framework

• Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling

LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk

• Defining, approving and monitoring of limits

• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk

assessments

Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk
There is no single measure to capture market risk and
therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics,
both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
• Value-at-risk (VaR)
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns
• Earnings-at-risk
• Other sensitivity-based measures

Risk monitoring and control
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series
of limits set in the context of the market environment and
business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk
Management takes into consideration factors such as
market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client
business, and management judgment. Market Risk
Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level
limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such
as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within
the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.

testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its
market risk positions.

The daily market data used in VaR models may be different
than the independent third-party data collected for VCG
price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example,
in cases where market prices are not observable, or where
proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data
sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for
further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR
model calculations require daily data and a consistent
source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data
collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR
model calculations.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page
149 for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in
accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which
is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory
VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day
holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which
approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is
applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital
rules, which may be different than the positions included in
the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s
Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these
credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently
excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the
Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory
VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed
VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The framework is employed across the Firm using historical
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in
market values are representative of the distribution of
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm
believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with
other market risk measures, provides the appropriate
information needed to respond to risk events.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to
measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across
product types and is used for aggregating risks and
monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are
reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and
regulators.

Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual
VaR models that simulate historical market returns for
individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture
material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are
performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to
market risk. These VaR models are granular and
incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate
daily changes in market values over the historical period;
inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each
portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to
generate daily market values may be different across
product types or risk management systems. The VaR model
results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm
level.

As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect
measure of market risk exposure and potential future
losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors,
VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to
measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly
those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or
severe shifts in market conditions.

For certain products, specific risk parameters are not
captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability
of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to
estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily
time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual
price-based time series for these products, if available,
would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore
considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature

of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) Average and maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR were primarily driven by a private equity position that became publicly traded at the end of the third

quarter of 2020. As of March 31, 2021 the Firm no longer held this position.

(c) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification

benefit is not meaningful.

Generally, average VaR across risk types and LOBs was
lower due to volatility which occurred at the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic rolling out of the one-year historical
look-back period, predominantly impacting exposures in
fixed income and commodities. As a result, average Total
VaR decreased by $40 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 when compared with the prior year.

In the current year, maximum VaR remained elevated
relative to average VaR as the aforementioned volatility
was still included in the historical look-back period in the
first quarter of 2021.

Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to
exclude certain real estate-related fair value option elected
loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based
measures to more effectively measure the risk from these
loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total
VaR and each of the components would have been higher
by the amounts reported in the following table:

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which
compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the
daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting
purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude
select components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e.,
intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, certain
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These
excluded components of total net revenue may more than
offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is
consistent with the requirements for backtesting under
Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting
loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology,
assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm
would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on

average five times every 100 trading days. The number of
VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if
the current level of market volatility is materially different
from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of
historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, the Firm
posted backtesting gains on 145 of the 260 days, and
observed 20 VaR backtesting exceptions. Twelve of the
backtesting exceptions were in the three months ended
December 31, 2021 as market volatility, particularly
related to interest rates, was materially higher than the
market volatility in the 12 months of historical data used
for the VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days can
differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets
and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB
Markets revenue, as the population of positions which
compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion
of select components of total net revenue in backtesting
gains and losses as described above. For more information
on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and
three months ended December 31, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding
daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point
intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in
the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Other risk measures
Stress testing
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to
assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market
behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive
positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures
the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed
but possible economic and market scenarios. The results
are used to understand the exposures responsible for those
potential losses and are measured against limits.

The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive
positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used
to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both
market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant
changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity
prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices,
and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of
hypothetical economic and market scenarios.

The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail
events in specific asset classes and geographies, including
how the event may impact multiple market factors
simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different
products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the
Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes
against possible future stress events. Stress testing results
are reported periodically to senior management of the
Firm, as appropriate.

Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress
framework, under the oversight of Market Risk
Management, and the models to calculate the stress results
are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk
Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress
Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to
stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm.
Significant changes to the framework are escalated to
senior management, as appropriate.

The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating
the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are
reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition,
stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk
Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the
Board Risk Committee.

Profit and loss drawdowns
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading
losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and
loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date
peak level.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk
arises not only from trading activities but also from the

Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits,
issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer
to the table on page 134 for a summary by LOB and
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural
interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject
to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO,
working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s
structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with
senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In
addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the
CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing
independent oversight and governance around assumptions
and establishing and monitoring limits for structural
interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate
risk generally through its investment securities portfolio
and interest rate derivatives.

Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of
factors, including:

• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of

assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments

• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-

balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing
at the same time

• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-
term market interest rates change (for example, changes
in the slope of the yield curve)

• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets,
liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest
rates change

The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis.
Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury
and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into
account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be
risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include
asset and liability balances and contractual rates of
interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected
prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and
maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest
rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S.
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies).
These simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-

transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
134.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different
factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but exclude
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates,
the time since origination, and other factors which are
updated periodically based on historical experience.
Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and scenarios do
not include assumptions to account for the reversal of
Quantitative Easing.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid
could change upon a given change in market interest
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and
other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income
(Refer to Outlook on page 49 for additional information).

Management’s discussion and analysis

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or
future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and
revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in
partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these
risks using derivatives.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net
revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to
the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 134 for additional information on the positions
captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2021 and 2020, as the movement in market parameters
across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

individual country. The use of different measurement
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of
reported country exposure.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement
framework:

•

Lending exposures are measured at the total committed
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities
collateral received

• Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with

•

•

•

central and commercial banks
Securities financing exposures are measured at their
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value
of all positions, including both long and short positions
Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair
value of the eligible collateral received
Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold is
reported based on the underlying reference entity and is
measured at the notional amount of protection
purchased or sold, net of the fair value of the recognized
derivative receivable or payable. Credit derivatives
protection purchased and sold in the Firm’s market-
making activities is measured on a net basis, as such
activities often result in selling and purchasing
protection related to the same underlying reference
entity; this reflects the manner in which the Firm
manages these exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory
requirements.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political
or other significant developments which adversely affect
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be
impacted by these developments and measures the extent
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk
management function that assesses, manages and monitors
exposure to country risk across the Firm.

The Firm’s country risk management function includes the
following activities:

• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards

consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework

• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and

establishing risk tolerance relative to a country

• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and

stress across the Firm

• Managing and approving country limits and reporting
trends and limit breaches to senior management

• Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models

and ratings indicators, for early identification of
potential country risk concerns

• Providing country risk scenario analysis

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes
activity with both government and private-sector entities in
a country.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is
based on the country where the largest proportion of the
assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal
residence) or country of incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors
attributed to that country. Activities which result in
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not
included in the country exposure measure (for example,
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to
collateral on securities financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the
measurement and allocation of country exposure,
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer,
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an

Management’s discussion and analysis

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s
country risk management framework, which aims to
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by
measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to
a country based on market shocks combined with
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk
Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or
sets of countries in response to specific or potential market
events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to
inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as
necessary.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries.

Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported
regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify
trends, and monitor high usages and breaches against
limits.

For country risk management purposes, the Firm may
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully
autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions
(“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the
independent sovereign states with which they are
associated.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2021, and
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s
internal country risk management approach, and does not
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate
from period to period due to client activity and market
flows.

The decrease in exposure to Germany and the increase in
exposure to the United Kingdom were primarily due to
changes in cash placements with the central banks of those
countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity
management activities in the fourth quarter of 2021.

The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased
cash placements with the central bank of Australia, largely
driven by client activity following monetary policy decisions
in the country and growth in client deposits.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems;
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business disruptions (including those caused by
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control) cyber
attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply
with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of
vendors or other third party providers to perform in
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk
Management attempts to manage operational risk at
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position,
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and
regulatory environments in which it operates.

Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable
the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test,
manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk.

Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the
management of operational risk. The Control Management
Organization, which consists of control managers within
each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day
execution of the CCOR Framework and the evaluation of the
effectiveness of their control environments to determine
where targeted remediation efforts may be required.

The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE
for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is
responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework
and establishing minimum standards for its execution. The
LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the
Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative
Risk Appetite and are independent of the respective
businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR
Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance
and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the
Board Risk Committee periodically.

Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-
assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate
evaluate the effectiveness of their control environment to
assess where controls have failed, and to determine where
remediation efforts may be required. The Firm’s
Operational Risk and Compliance organization
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of
and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform
independent assessments of significant operational risk
events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.

Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent
assessment of the operational risks inherent within the
LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the
effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the
results to senior management.

In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses
operational risks through quantitative means, including
operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational
risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions.

The primary component of the operational risk capital
estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”)
statistical model, which simulates the frequency and
severity of future operational risk loss projections based on
historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an
aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time
horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model
incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the
quarter following the period in which those losses were
realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect
such losses even after the issues or business activities
giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.

As required under the Basel III capital framework, the
Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which
uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”),
incorporates internal and external losses as well as
management’s view of tail risk captured through
operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key
business environment and internal control metrics. The
Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA
estimate of operational risk capital.

The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a
forward looking view of material operational risk events
that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s
operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in
calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress
testing processes.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for
information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.

Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by Operational
Risk and Compliance are leveraged as one of the key
criteria in the independent monitoring and testing of the
LOBs and Corporate’s compliance with laws, rules and
regulation. Through monitoring and testing, Operational
Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of
heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of
controls within the LOBs and Corporate.

143

Management’s discussion and analysis

Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as
needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and
Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the
development and implementation of action plans.

Operational Risk Reporting
Escalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for
employees at the Firm. Risks identified by Operational Risk
and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and
Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk
and Compliance has established standards to ensure that
consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk
reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the
LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of
key risk and performance indicators against established
thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of
operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards
reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to
the Board of Directors.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways.
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk,
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement
processes. Refer to pages 146, 147, 148 and 149,
respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct,
Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other
select examples of operational risks are provided below.

Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure to harm
or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by
malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is an important and
continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant
resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the
security of computer systems, software, networks, storage
devices, and other technology assets. The Firm’s security
efforts are designed to protect against, among other things,
cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to
obtain access to confidential information, destroy data,
disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other
damage.

Ongoing business expansions may expose the Firm to
potential new threats as well as expanded regulatory
scrutiny including the introduction of new cybersecurity
requirements. The Firm continues to make significant
investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and
to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate
government and law enforcement agencies and other
businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of
cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance
defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity
threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions and
simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with

law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry
groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate
employees and certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity
risks.

Third parties with which the Firm does business or that
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply
chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and
financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity
risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as
system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the
employees of such parties, or cyberattacks, including
ransomware and supply-chain compromises could affect
their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or
result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its
clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the
Firm and its information assets, particularly when their
activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security
and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in
regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and
clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to
improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents
occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of
their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for
losses incurred.

To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the
Firm maintains a cybersecurity program designed to
prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Audit
Committee is periodically provided with updates on the
Firm’s Information Security Program, recommended
changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing
efforts to improve security, as well as its efforts regarding
significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a
cybersecurity incident response plan (“IRP”) designed to
enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity
incidents, coordinate such responses with law enforcement
and other government agencies, and notify clients and
customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the
IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading
connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various
escalation points.

Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm
increased the use of remote access and video conferencing
solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote
work. As a result the Firm deployed additional
precautionary measures and controls to mitigate
cybersecurity risks and those measures and controls remain
in place.

The Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are
responsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s
Information Security Program. In partnership with the
Firm’s LOBs and Corporate, the Cybersecurity and
Technology Control organization identifies information
security risk issues and oversees programs for the
technological protection of the Firm’s information resources
including applications, infrastructure as well as confidential

144

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

and personal information related to the Firm’s employees
and customers. The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls
organization consists of business aligned information
security managers that are supported within the
organization by the following products that execute the
Information Security Program for the Firm:

Cyber Operations
Identity & Access Management

•
•
• Governance, Risk & Controls
• Global Technology Product Security

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control
governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and
mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key
governance forums to disseminate information and monitor
technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple
levels throughout the Firm and include representatives
from each LOB and Corporate. The forums are used to
escalate information security risks or other matters as
appropriate.

The IRM function provides oversight of the activities
designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate
cybersecurity risk.

The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training
that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and
Security Management policies, standards and practices, as
well as the expectation that employees comply with these
policies. The Security Awareness Program engages
personnel through training on how to identify potential
cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and
information. This training is mandatory for all employees
globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by
Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing
tests. The Firm provides specialized security training for
certain employee roles such as application developers.
Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all
employees to take periodic awareness training on data
privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information
about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to
unauthorized access to or use of information.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services,
cyberattacks and, terrorism. The Firmwide Business
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business
disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event
beyond its control that may impact critical business
functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology,
facilities and third parties). The program includes
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business
interruption and public safety risks.

Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The
risk of payment fraud normalized in 2021 since the
heightened levels experienced during earlier stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm continues to employ various
controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as
providing employee and client education and awareness
trainings.

Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates
Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and
Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding,
monitoring and managing their supplier relationships
including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of
the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third
parties to a high level of operational performance and to
mitigate key risks, including data loss and business
disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group
is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting
and standards.

Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated
is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm
purchases insurance from commercial insurers and
maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance
Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties
with whom the Firm does business.

Management’s discussion and analysis

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the
risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or
codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory
organizations.

Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of
and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is independent
of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review,
monitoring and oversight of business operations with a
focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations
applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and
services to clients and customers.

These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws,
rules and regulations varying across the LOBs and
Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to
financial products and services, relationships and
interactions with clients and customers, and employee
activities. For example, compliance risks include those
associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading
activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws,
rules, and regulations related to the offering of products
and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk
is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including
the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care (such
as the duties of loyalty or care), to act in the best interest of
clients and customers or to treat clients and customers
fairly.

Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory
obligations that are specific to their respective areas of
responsibility.

Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and
standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor
and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.

Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global
CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk
Appetite.

The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its
compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR
Risk Management Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and
FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also
provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee and
the Audit Committee. In certain cases, Special Purpose
Committees of the Board may be established to oversee the
Firm’s compliance with regulatory Consent Orders.

Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth
the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct
themselves with integrity at all times and provides the
principles that govern employee conduct with clients,
customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with
the markets and communities in which the Firm does
business. The Code requires employees to promptly report
any potential or actual violation of the Code, any internal
Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the
Firm’s business. It also requires employees to report any
illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying
principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees,
clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business
partners, or agents. Code training is assigned to newly hired
employees upon joining the Firm, and to current employees
periodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to
affirm their compliance with the Code at least annually.

Employees can report any potential or actual violations of
the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline by phone or
the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain
non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous
reporting, and is available at all times globally, with
translation services. It is administered by an outside service
provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who
raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the
Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct
program.

146

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT

Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk
that any action or inaction by an employee or employees
could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact
the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or
compromise the Firm’s reputation.

Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and
managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture
consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles
(the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how
employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the
Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the
Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides
information and resources to help employees conduct
business ethically and in compliance with the laws
everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk
Management on page 146 for further discussion of the
Code.

Governance and oversight
The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR
Management policy, which establishes the framework for
governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and
testing, management and reporting conduct risk in the
Firm.

The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the
Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of
conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm
in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of
focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program
direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's
employee conduct framework and reviewing the
consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.

Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of
people management practices throughout the employee life
cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and
development, performance management, promotion and
compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and
each designated corporate function completes an
assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics
and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides
conduct education as appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of
loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to
meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with
clients and customers, and products and services offered by
the Firm.

Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services
and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing
the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:

• managing actual and potential litigation and

enforcement matters, including internal reviews and
investigations related to such matters

•

•

advising on products and services, including contract
negotiation and documentation

advising on offering and marketing documents and new
business initiatives

• managing dispute resolution

•

•

interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and
advising on changes to them

advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated
and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and

• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the

Board.

Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the
Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In
addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which
reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have
the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a
member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk
Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s
General Counsel and other members of Legal report on
significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors
and to the Audit Committee.
Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises
the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk
issues.

148

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations across various businesses and functions.
The estimation methods are of varying levels of
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing,
evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making
business decisions. A dedicated independent function,
Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and
governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of
model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and
judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk
management, budget forecasting and capital planning and
analysis.

The governance of analytical and judgment-based
estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent
approach which is used for models, as described in detail
below.

Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the
Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users
and developers of models are responsible for developing,
implementing and testing their models, as well as referring
models to the MRGR for review and approval. Once models
have been approved, model users and developers are
responsible for maintaining a robust operating
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the
performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model
users and developers may seek to enhance models in
response to changes in the portfolios and in product and
market developments, as well as to capture improvements
in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.

Models are tiered based on an internal standard according
to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model
and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject
to the approval of the MRGR. In its review of a model, the
MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the
specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing
a model, the MRGR analyzes and challenges the model
methodology and the reasonableness of model
assumptions, and may perform or require additional
testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model
reviews are approved by the appropriate level of
management within the MRGR based on the relevant model
tier.

Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management
Policy, the MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well
as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In
certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the
Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or
approval. The MRGR may also require the user to take
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the
current and forecasted environment is significantly
different from the historical macroeconomic environments
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm
experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19
pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a greater
degree of judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to
model outputs than in typical periods.

pages 150-153 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based
valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates
are integral to understanding its reported results. The
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has
established policies and control procedures intended to
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,
independently reviewed and applied consistently from
period to period. The methods used and judgments made
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or
liabilities and the related business and risk management
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are
intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of
historical loss experience, assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information
on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for
credit losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one
reporting period to the next.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the
Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse
and upside scenarios compared to the significant weighting
that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of
December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained improvement
and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition,
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic
caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used
for modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues to
place reliance on management judgment and make
adjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser
extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit losses of
$18.7 billion reflects remaining uncertainties, including the
potential impact that additional waves or variants of
COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and
near-term supply chain disruptions.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit
losses because management considers a wide variety of
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and relative
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 129 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S.
unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.8% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 4.4% in the second quarter of 2022; lower
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly

150

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

3.2% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a
peak difference of approximately 6.5% in the second
quarter of 2022; and lower national HPI with a peak
difference of nearly 15.8% in the second quarter of 2023.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future
changes in the allowance for credit losses as the impacts of
changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear,
so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated
for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.
Additionally, expectations of future changes in portfolio
composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect
the allowance for credit losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2021, the
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit
losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the
lending exposures below reflect the following differences:

• An increase of approximately $550 million for residential

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.6 billion for credit card

loans

• An increase of approximately $3.0 billion for wholesale

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and
appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2021.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including,
derivatives and structured note products. Certain assets and
liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of
the underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified

within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for
further information.

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total

reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.3 billion of
derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting
adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on
the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3
balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value
are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the
application of judgment. The type and level of judgment
required is largely dependent on the amount of observable
market information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to
estimate fair value are more significant than those required
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified
within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument
within level 3, management must first determine the
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable
inputs used.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

151

Management’s discussion and analysis

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of
fair value for individual financial instruments.

Goodwill impairment
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting
units and tested for impairment at least annually. The
Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill
impairment testing is described in Note 15.

Management applies significant judgment when testing
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each
business combination is allocated to the related reporting
units for goodwill impairment testing.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Firm reviewed
current economic conditions, including the potential
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business
performance, estimated market cost of equity, as well as
actual business results and projections of business
performance for its reporting units. The Firm has concluded
that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not
impaired as of December 31, 2021. For each of the
reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at
least 10% and there was no indication of a significant risk
of goodwill impairment based on current projections and
valuations.

The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent
with management’s current business outlook assumptions
in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long-
term growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where
possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to
benchmark its assumptions and estimates.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill,
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of
December 31, 2021.

Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards
programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points
based on their account activity and the terms and
conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no
limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor
do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a
variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the
form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm
maintains a rewards liability which represents the
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be
redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the
cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the
cardholder redeems points. This liability was $9.8 billion
and $7.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards
points earned on increased spend and promotional offers
outpacing redemptions throughout 2021, and to a lesser
extent adjustments to redemption rate assumptions.

The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”)
and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption
is used to estimate the number of points earned by
customers that will be redeemed over the life of the
account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of
future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated
periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder
redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates
to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of
December 31, 2021, a combined increase of 25 basis
points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the
rewards liability by approximately $265 million.

Income taxes
JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the
various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S.
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These
laws are often complex and may be subject to different
interpretations. To determine the financial statement
impact of accounting for income taxes, including the
provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax
benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and
judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex
tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as
well as make judgments regarding the timing of when
certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and
non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the
world are subject to review and examination by the various
taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm
operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a
tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the
various taxing authorities may be settled by audit,
administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such
differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for
income taxes in the period in which such a determination is
made.

The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of
current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax
provisions are calculated based on estimates and
assumptions that could differ from the actual results
reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally
recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and
the global tax implications are known, which could impact
the Firm’s effective tax rate.

Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income
taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 30 for a description of the significant
estimates and judgments associated with establishing
litigation reserves.

of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates.
JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be
assessed additional income taxes as a result of the
resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional
unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the
Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes
in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business
strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate
of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of
operations in any reporting period.

Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and
liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income
tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if,
in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined
to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the
provision for income taxes in the period enacted.

The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in
connection with certain tax attributes, including net
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit
(“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews
to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable.
These reviews include management’s estimates and
assumptions regarding future taxable income, including
foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax
planning strategies, including strategies that may be
available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In
connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a
deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is
established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a
subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that,
based on revised estimates of future taxable income or
changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not
that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become
realizable. As of December 31, 2021, management has
determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will
realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation
allowance.

The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary
when new information becomes available, including
changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with
taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain
tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit
that management believes is more likely than not to be
realized upon settlement. It is possible that the
reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax
benefits may have a material impact on its effective income
tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs.
Although the Firm believes that its estimates are
reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the
amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and
accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase”
or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by
JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and
other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2021. In making the assessment, management used the
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”)
promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

Based upon the assessment performed, management
concluded that as of December 31, 2021, JPMorgan
Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework.
Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the
Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in
its internal control over financial reporting as of

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Shareholders  of  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control
over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the
“Firm”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021,
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited
the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2021 and
2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Firm changed the manner in which it
accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in
2020.

Basis for Opinions

The Firm’s management is responsible for these
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s report on internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the
Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters
arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)
relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component of
Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios

As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-
based component of the wholesale and credit card loan
portfolios was $14.0 billion on total portfolio-based
retained loans of $711.4 billion at December 31, 2021. The
Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining
expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers
expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The
portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan
losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan
portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected
credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying
credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The
credit loss factors applied are determined based on the
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the
Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast
macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are
U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product.
This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.

The principal considerations for our determination that
performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan
losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale
and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are
(i) the significant judgment and estimation by management
in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S.
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the
Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect
its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet
date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by
management in determining the quantitative calculation
utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to
take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate,
which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,
subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in

evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit
loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments
to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort
involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses,
including controls over model validation and generation of
macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included,
among others, testing management’s process for estimating
the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating
the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used
in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the
reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S.
real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness
and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv)
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s
adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of
model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and
other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected
in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included
the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of
certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic
variables.

Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments

As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Firm carries $1.2 trillion of its assets and
$403.1 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring
basis. Included in these balances are $9.6 billion of trading
assets and $41.5 billion of liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments,
which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more
inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant
to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally
developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to
estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The
unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the
fair value of certain of these financial instruments include
forward equity prices, volatility relating to interest rates
and equity prices and correlation relating to interest rates,
equity prices, credit and foreign exchange rates.

The principal considerations for our determination that
performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain
level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i)
the significant judgment and estimation by management in
determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn
led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and
effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit
evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial
instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to the Firm’s determination of the fair
value, including controls over models, inputs, and data.
These procedures also included, among others, the
involvement of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate
of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and
comparing management’s estimate to the independently
developed estimate of fair value. Developing the
independent estimate involved testing the completeness
and accuracy of data provided by management, developing
independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and
utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable
inputs.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities.

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform with the current presentation.
Notably in the first quarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified
certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts
payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a
reduction to the carrying value of the associated tax-
oriented investments. Refer to Note 25 for further
information.

Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by
the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.

Voting interest entities
Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient
equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that
enable them to make significant decisions relating to the
entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s
determination of whether it has a controlling interest is
primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests
held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial
interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’
voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights
that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.

Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant
influence over operating and financing decisions (but does
not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are
accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of
accounting (which requires the Firm to recognize its
proportionate share of the entity’s net earnings), or (ii) at
fair value if the fair value option was elected. These
investments are generally included in other assets, with
income or loss included in noninterest revenue.

Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are
structured as limited partnerships or limited liability
companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the
general partner or managing member, but the non-
affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove
the Firm as the general partner or managing member
without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple
majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members
have rights to participate in important decisions.
Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting
interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the
non-managing partners or members do not have
substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm
evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if
the Firm is the general partner or managing member and
has both power and a potentially significant interest.

The Firm’s investment companies and asset management
funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately-
held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth
equity and venture opportunities. These investments are
accounted for under investment company guidelines and,
accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity
ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated
balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other
assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.
If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such
specialized investment company guidelines.

Variable interest entities
VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient
equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other
parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the
ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s
operations through voting rights, or do not have the
obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the
right to receive the residual returns of the entity.

The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly
used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain
assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to
investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company
selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of
those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal
documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash
earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s
investors and other parties that have rights to those cash
flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors
from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other
entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.

The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a
controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the
assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is
the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

165

Notes to consolidated financial statements

obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the
activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s
economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and
circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and
its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment
includes, first, identifying the activities that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and
second, identifying which party, if any, has power over
those activities. In general, the parties that make the most
significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset
managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call
options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have
the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are
deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.

To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb
losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm
considers all of its economic interests, including debt and
equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other
arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE.
This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in
determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are
considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors
considered in assessing significance include: the design of
the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination
of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests
held across various classes within the VIE’s capital
structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the
Firm.

The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether
entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-
interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain
events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation
framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and
circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE
cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change.

Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs.

Revenue recognition

Interest income
The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt
securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level-
yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer
to Note 7 for further discussion of interest income.

Revenue from contracts with customers
JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from
certain contracts with customers, in investment banking
fees, deposit-related fees, asset management
administration and commissions, and components of card
income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations
are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the
Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers.

Principal transactions revenue
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities
at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for
further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note
6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue.

Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated
financial statements
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these
estimates.

Foreign currency translation
JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and
expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S.
dollars using applicable exchange rates.

Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency
financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the
Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains
and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions,
including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency
is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated
statements of income.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP
also permits securities sold and purchased under
repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned
under securities loan agreements to be presented net when
specified conditions are met, including the existence of a
legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has
elected to net such balances where it has determined that
the specified conditions are met.

The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate
counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including
derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities
borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master
netting agreement is a single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the
event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a
required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral
or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives
termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all
transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued
and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are
netted against the negative values of “out of the money”
transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation
is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination
amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)
The adoption of this guidance established a single
allowance framework for all financial assets measured at
amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit
exposures. This framework requires that management’s
estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s
remaining expected life and considers expected future
changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption
of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s allowance for
credit losses represented management’s estimate of
probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan
portfolios and certain lending-related commitments. The
adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, resulted in a $2.7
billion decrease to retained earnings.

agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i)
all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all
values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are
calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other
and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of
the parties to pay the netted termination amount.

Typical master netting agreements for these types of
transactions also often contain a collateral/margin
agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title
transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party
that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding
party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires
a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding
party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit
on a net basis across all transactions governed by the
master netting agreement, less any threshold. The
collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding
party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off
any amounts payable by the counterparty against any
posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted
collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the
right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the
proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.

Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s
derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further
discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements.

Statements of cash flows
For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash
flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash
and due from banks and deposits with banks on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities
at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly
carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and
liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets,
liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they
are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are
subject to fair value adjustments only in certain
circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of
impairment).

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market
prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not
available, fair value is based on valuation models and other
valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction
characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs,
observable or unobservable market parameters, including
yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as
commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign
exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments
may be made to ensure that financial instruments are
recorded at fair value, as described below.

The level of precision in estimating unobservable market
inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the
Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of different
methodologies or assumptions by other market participants
compared with those used by the Firm could result in the
Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the
reporting date.

Valuation process
Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair
value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s
Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s
Finance function and independent of the risk-taking
functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and
determining any fair value adjustments that may be
required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at
fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance
Forum (“VGF”), which is composed of senior finance and
risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the
management of risks arising from valuation activities
conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by
the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the
Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the

CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including
Treasury and CIO.

Price verification process
The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-
taking functions by leveraging independently derived
prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where
available. Where independent prices or inputs are not
available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the
reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may
include evaluating the limited market activity including
client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those
used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of
structured instruments into individual components,
comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit
and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral
valuation. There are also additional levels of management
review for more significant or complex positions.

The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be
required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking
functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for
instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further
information on the fair value hierarchy). For other
positions, judgment is required to assess the need for
valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net
open risk position. The determination of such adjustments
follows a consistent framework across the Firm:

•

•

Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an
observable external price or valuation parameter exists
but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower
market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are
made based on current market conditions. Factors that
may be considered in determining the liquidity
adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-
offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2)
alternative pricing points for similar instruments in
active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values
that the price or parameter could take.

The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial
instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and,
as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the
fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of
the entire net open risk position in an orderly
transaction. Where this is the case, valuation
adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of
exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk
position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on
factors that a relevant market participant would
consider in the transfer of the net open risk position,
including the size of the adverse market move that is
likely to occur during the period required to reduce the
net open risk position to a normal market-size.

• Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable

parameters may be made when positions are valued

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

169

Notes to consolidated financial statements

using prices or input parameters to valuation models
that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or
because they cannot be implied from observable market
data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and
are, therefore, subject to management judgment.
Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty
inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.

• Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to
its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately
reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own
creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA),
using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to
Credit and funding adjustments on page 186 of this Note
for more information on such adjustments.

Valuation model review and approval
If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a
similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using
valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms
such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or
independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case
the price verification process described above is applied to
the inputs in those models.

Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management
Policy, the MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well
as material changes to existing models, prior to
implementation in the operating environment. In certain
circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s
policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or
approval. The MRGR may also require the user to take
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

Fair value hierarchy
A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established
under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements.
The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.

•

•

•

Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation
methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair
value measurement.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value
hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement.

170

for further information.

•  Market rates for the respective maturity
•  Collateral characteristics

Loans and lending-related
commitments — wholesale

Where observable market data is available, valuations are based on:

Level 2 or 3

Loans carried at fair value
(trading loans and non-trading
loans) and associated
lending-related commitments

•  Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent)
•  Relevant broker quotes
•  Observed market prices for similar instruments

Where observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are
based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following:

•  Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit

curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating

•  Prepayment speed
•  Collateral characteristics

Loans — consumer

Loans carried at fair value —
conforming residential
mortgage loans expected to be
sold

Investment and trading
securities

Fair value is based on observable market prices for mortgage-backed
securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to
these prices to account for differences between the securities and the
value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics,
portfolio composition, and liquidity.

Predominantly level 2

Quoted market prices

Level 1

In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based
on:

Level 2 or 3

•  Observable market prices for similar securities
•  Relevant broker quotes
•  Discounted cash flows

In addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for
the following products:
Mortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs:

•  Collateral characteristics
•  Deal-specific payment and loss allocations
•  Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed,

conditional default rates and loss severity

Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) specific inputs:

•  Collateral characteristics
•  Deal-specific payment and loss allocations
•  Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss
severity
•  Credit spreads

Derivatives

Valuation methodology
Exchange-traded derivatives that are actively traded and valued using
the exchange price.

Classifications in the fair value
hierarchy
Level 1

Derivatives that are valued using models such as the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models
that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs as well as
considering the contractual terms.

Level 2 or 3

The key valuation inputs used will depend on the type of derivative and
the nature of the underlying instruments and may include equity prices,
commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, volatilities, correlations, CDS
spreads and recovery rates.

In addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued based on
models with significant unobservable inputs are as follows:
Interest rate and FX exotic options specific inputs include:

•  Interest rate volatility
•  Interest rate spread volatility
•  Interest rate correlation
•  Interest rate-FX correlation
•  Foreign exchange correlation
•  Interest rate curve

Structured credit derivatives specific inputs include:

•  Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments
•  CDS spreads and recovery rates
Equity option specific inputs include:

•  Forward equity price
•  Equity volatility
•  Equity correlation
•  Equity-FX correlation
•  Equity-IR correlation

Commodity derivatives specific inputs include:

•  Forward commodity price
•  Commodity volatility
•  Commodity correlation

Additionally, adjustments are made to reflect counterparty credit quality
(CVA) and the impact of funding (FVA). Refer to page 186 of this Note.

Mortgage servicing rights

Refer to Mortgage servicing rights in Note 15.

Level 3

Level 2 or 3

Private equity direct
investments

Fund investments (e.g.,
mutual/collective investment
funds, private equity funds,
hedge funds, and real estate
funds)

Beneficial interests issued by
consolidated VIEs

Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range of
potential inputs include:
•  Transaction prices
•  Trading multiples of comparable public companies
•  Operating performance of the underlying portfolio company

•  Adjustments as required, since comparable public companies are

not identical to the company being valued, and for company-specific
issues and lack of liquidity.

•  Additional available inputs relevant to the investment.

Net asset value

•  NAV is supported by the ability to redeem and purchase at the NAV

Level 1

level.

•  Adjustments to the NAV as required, for restrictions on redemption

(e.g., lock-up periods or withdrawal limitations) or where
observable activity is limited.

Valued using observable market information, where available.
In the absence of observable market information, valuations are based
on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE.

Level 2 or 3(a)

Level 2 or 3

(a) Excludes certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.

the embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of
the note.

•  The embedded derivative features are considered using models such
as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a
combination of models that may use observable or unobservable
valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The
specific inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded
derivative features, as described in the discussion above regarding

(a) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $73.9 billion and $117.6 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.
(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S.
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have
been included in each period presented.

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).

Notes to consolidated financial statements

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private
equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $801 million and $670 million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020,
were trading assets of $51 million and $52 million, respectively, and other assets of $750 million and $618 million, respectively.

(e) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $26.2 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $8.2 billion and $6.3

billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell
to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $13.6 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit
associated with cash collateral.

(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty
or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the
characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each
balance sheet date.

Level 3 valuations
The Firm has established well-structured processes for
determining fair value, including for instruments where fair
value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs
(level 3). Refer to pages 169-173 of this Note for further
information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed
discussion of the determination of fair value for individual
financial instruments.

Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment.
The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent
on the amount of observable market information available to
the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed
valuation models and other valuation techniques that use
significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to
estimate fair value are more significant than those required
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified
within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument
within level 3, management must first determine the
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to
use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant
inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield
curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,
volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign
exchange rates and credit curves.

The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those
inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such
inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument
within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable
inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is,
components that are actively quoted and can be validated to
external sources) in addition to the unobservable
components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not
included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk
of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments
using securities and derivative positions that are classified
within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The range of values presented in the table is representative
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the
significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument
classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the
input values presented in the table are calculated based on
the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used
to value.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated

balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $265 million, nonagency securities of $28 million and non-trading loans of $888 million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $10 million, trading loans of $40 million and non-trading loans of $341 million.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $668 million and non-trading loans of $704 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain

embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant
unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $806 million including $144 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is

generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant
both individually and in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-

based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative-related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to
collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the
underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the
obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating)
of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically
collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a
higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower
credit quality, all other factors being equal.

Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a
measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral
balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of
defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship
between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds,
collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral
has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower
conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default
rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss
severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the
conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a
decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default
rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a
securitization and the structure of the securitization itself.
Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-
making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically
at the lower end of the range presented.

Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the
recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized
losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular
loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the
outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is
generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default
rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed
security investment depends on factors relating to the
underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of
the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-
specific factors.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
The following discussion provides a description of the impact
on a fair value measurement of a change in each
unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship
between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant.
The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a
change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change
in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist
between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are
discussed below. Relationships may also exist between
observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as
observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment
rates decline); such relationships have not been included in
the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual
relationships described below, the inverse relationship would
also generally apply.

The following discussion also provides a description of
attributes of the underlying instruments and external market
factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of
the Firm’s positions.

Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to
discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow
calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result
in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional
annualized return over the market interest rate that a market
participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit
risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument
forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow
calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-
backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the
instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of
the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not
correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore,
the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk
inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk
inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the
subordination of the security being valued and the
characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the
collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV
ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the
property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For
corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and
municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads
reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the
obligation.

Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of
the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a
prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment
speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An
increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a
decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a
premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement
of assets valued at a discount to par.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship
between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a
pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is
driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are
related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit,
equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature
of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively
correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an
increase in the other parameter. When parameters are
negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will
result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in
correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair
value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an
increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in
a decrease in a fair value measurement.

The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives
with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of
factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the
correlation between two credit risk exposures would be
different than that between two interest rate risk exposures.
Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the
correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying
risks may be different over different time periods.
Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on
market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of
levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in
volatile market conditions.

Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible
returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given
how much the particular instrument, parameter or index
changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for
options, including equity options, commodity options, and
interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of
the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long
position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation,
would generally result in an increase in a fair value
measurement.

The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular
option-based derivative depends on a number of factors,
including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g.,
the volatility of a particular equity security may be
significantly different from that of a particular commodity
index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price
of the option.

Interest rate curve – represents the relationship of interest
rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to
set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows
and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any
derivative cash flow.

Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer
agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract
on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that
the value of the contract is zero at inception.

The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of
certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors
including interest rates, the current price of the underlying
asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be
incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until
the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an
increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated
balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for
financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of
the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019. When a determination is made to
classify a financial instrument within level 3, the
determination is based on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in
addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are actively
quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include
changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that
are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-
manages the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as
these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are
not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables
do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management
activities related to such level 3 instruments.

• $10 million of net gains on assets driven by gains in net

interest rate derivative receivables due to market
movements largely offset by losses in MSRs reflecting
faster prepayment speeds on lower rates.

• $102 million of net gains on liabilities driven by market

movements in short-term borrowings.

2019
• $2.1 billion of net losses on assets largely due to MSRs

transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following:

• $1.5 billion of total debt and equity instruments, the
majority of which were obligations of U.S. states and
municipalities and trading loans, driven by an increase in
observability.

• $1.1 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and

$1.3 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result
of an increase in observability and a decrease in the
significance of unobservable inputs.

• $962 million of gross commodities derivative payables as

a result of an increase in observability.

• $1.2 billion of deposits as a result of an increase in
observability and a decrease in the significance of

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives
Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as
their basis observable market parameters. These market
parameters generally do not consider factors such as
counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit
quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally
necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair
value to reflect these factors.

CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant
benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty
nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a
scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit
exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with
each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the
probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a
result of a counterparty credit event considering
contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit
exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The
key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a
default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived
from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated
recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider
the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor
relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally
reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.

FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of
funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a
market participant in the principal market would
incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s
FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including
partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”)
derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected
funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with

each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the
estimated market funding cost in the principal market
which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit
risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the
relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying
collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a
separate FVA is not necessary.

The following table provides the impact of credit and
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in
the respective periods, excluding the effect of any
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below
includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the
inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes
in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected
liabilities
The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s
own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities
reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability)
in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are
estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread
observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to
DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in
principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses
are reported in OCI. Refer to page 184 in this Note and Note
24 for further information.

(a)  Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $1.6 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2021, $1.5 billion related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.

(b)  Of the $856 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2021, $254 million related to residential real
estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as
they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 12% to 45% with a weighted average of 25%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative),
with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed
necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for
private equity direct investments.

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded
during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the
nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B common shares, recorded at a
nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa
Class A common shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B
common shares into Visa Class A common shares is 1.6181 at December 31, 2021, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on
developments related to the litigation matters.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial
instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated
balance sheets at fair value
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of
certain financial instruments, which are included in the
following table. However, this table does not include other
items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain
financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the
opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add
significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is
not disclosed in this table.

Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates
fair value
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair
value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at
amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-
term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These
instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with
banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale
agreements and securities borrowed, short-term
receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term
borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and
sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and
accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the
fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e.,
demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be
equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent
funding value of these instruments is not permitted.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,

contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as

notice. Refer to page 171 of this Note for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value
as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets,
financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and
written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair
value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the
measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an
accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis,
as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following
instruments:

•

Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization
warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-
related commitments

•

Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets
that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as
a derivative instrument

•

•

Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which
are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as
part of client-driven activities

Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s
consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such
risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid

financial instruments recorded in CIB. Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense.

(f) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items
for which the fair value option was elected
The following describes how the gains and losses that are
attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk,
were determined.

•

Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-
rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to
instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate
instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for
the period is made between those changes in value that
are interest rate-related and changes in value that are
credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an
analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery

•

•

information, where available, or benchmarking to
similar entities or industries.
Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to
instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally
from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as
observed in the bond market.

Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these
types of agreements, there is a requirement that
collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or
in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result,
there would be no adjustment or an immaterial
adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to
these agreements.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected

structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if

applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was
elected was $11.9 billion and $18.1 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $10 million and $(39) million,
respectively. Refer to Note 28 for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan
syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations,
credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral
and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for
additional information on loans.

The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any
particular loan product or industry segment results in a
significant concentration of credit risk.

Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included
in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and
establishing its allowance for loan losses.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients,
counterparties or customers are engaged in similar
business activities or activities in the same geographic
region, or when they have similar economic features that
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to
be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its
credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk
concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when
deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s
agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in
the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are
adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite.

In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic
region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the
portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations
can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies
and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional
information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s
consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit
risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and
monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level
and on an individual client or counterparty basis.

(b) The  industry  rankings  presented  in  the  table  as  of  December  31,  2020,  are  based  on  the  industry  rankings  of  the  corresponding  exposures  at

December 31, 2021, not actual rankings of such exposures at December 31, 2020.

(c) Individuals  and  Individual  Entities  predominantly  consists  of  Global  Private  Bank  clients  within  AWM  and  includes  exposure  to  personal  investment

companies and personal and testamentary trusts.

(d) In addition to the credit risk exposure to states and municipal governments (both U.S. and non-U.S.) at December 31, 2021 and 2020, noted above, the
Firm held: $7.1 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, of trading assets; $15.9 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, of AFS securities; and $14.0 billion
and $12.8 billion, respectively, of HTM securities, issued by U.S. state and municipal governments. Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 for further information.
(e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 94% and 6%, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and

92% and 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2020 . Refer to Note 14 for more information on exposures to SPEs.

(f) Receivables  from  customers  reflect  held-for-investment  margin  loans  to  brokerage  clients  in  CIB,  CCB  and  AWM  that  are  collateralized  by  assets
maintained  in  the  clients’  brokerage  accounts  (e.g.,  cash  on  deposit,  liquid  and  readily  marketable  debt  or  equity  securities).  Because  of  this
collateralization,  no  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  generally  held  against  these  receivables.  To  manage  its  credit  risk  the  Firm  establishes  margin
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce
positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $729.6 billion and $516.9 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is predominantly placed with

various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.

(h) Credit  exposure  is  net  of  risk  participations  and  excludes  the  benefit  of  credit  derivatives  used  in  credit  portfolio  management  activities  held  against

derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables.

(i) At  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  included  $5.4  billion  and  $19.2  billion  of  loans  in  Business  Banking  under  the  PPP,  respectively.  PPP  loans  are
guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an
allowance for loan losses on these loans.

(j) Represents lending-related financial instruments.
(k) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 5 – Derivative instruments
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying
asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a
combination of these factors and may expose
counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset
or liability without having to initially invest in, own or
exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes
markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives
to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly
all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-
making or risk management purposes.

Market-making derivatives
The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for
market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate
or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and
commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from
its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other
derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other
financial instruments that partially or fully offset the
exposure from client derivatives.

Risk management derivatives
The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures
using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge
accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used
to manage risks associated with specified assets and
liabilities.

The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage
the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate
assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market
value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income
and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-
rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates,
and as a result of the repayment and subsequent
origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at
current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative
instruments related to these assets and liabilities are
expected to substantially offset this variability.

Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the
foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign
currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and
liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s
net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches
whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a
result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–
equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated
assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses
increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative
instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated
assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected
to substantially offset this variability.

Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk
of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these
derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset
the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.

Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty
credit risk associated with loans and lending-related
commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser
when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a
credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an
obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of
CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages
207-210 of this Note for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses
table on page 207 of this Note, and the hedge accounting
gains and losses tables on pages 204-206 of this Note for
more information about risk management derivatives.

Derivative counterparties and settlement types
The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated
and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The
Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as
futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts
with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized
contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP,
which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the
transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a
bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.

Derivative clearing services
The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the
Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and
clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’
derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial
Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the
Firm’s clearing services.

Accounting for derivatives
All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its
own account are required to be recorded on the
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.

As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative
assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral
receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable
master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the
derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further
discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The
accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on
whether or not the transaction has been designated and
qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not
designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair
value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages
200-207 of this Note provide additional information on the
amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities,
gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further
discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are
recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged
item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting
earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of
the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net
interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge
relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the
derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when
the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge
relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted
transaction is expected to not occur according to the
original hedge forecast, any related derivative values
recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.

JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the
value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are
not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges,
changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes
in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as
translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the
assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in
earnings.

Derivatives designated as hedges
The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives
executed for risk management purposes – generally interest
rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives.
However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge
accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm’s
risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not
apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage
the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments,
because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as
hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply
hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange,
and commodity derivatives used for risk management
purposes.

To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly
effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated
as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy
must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify
the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or
forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and
how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed
prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness,
the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression
analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value
comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative
to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged
item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the
evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to
which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to
be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or
cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and
documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated
exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.

There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair
value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.
JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge
fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain
commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges,
the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the
value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are
recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the
assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and
recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the
hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to
the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the
basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate
hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment.
Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized
consistent with the classification of the hedged item –
primarily net interest income and principal transactions
revenue.

JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge
the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from
floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency–
denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by
contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same
counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion
with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are
not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown
separately in the tables below.

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and
payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate
counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown

separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure
amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;

• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of

the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and

• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to
credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts
and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of
JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral
agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.

While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the
derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the
contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit
ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2021 and 2020, related to OTC
and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings
downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the
predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a
preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral
(except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination
payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating
of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2021 and
2020.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate

risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.

(b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net
interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate
swaps and the related hedged items.

(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.

(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net

realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward

points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.

(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-

currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $25.7 billion and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to which the Firm
applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing
unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future
periods.

(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not

reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is
$14.0 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $10.8 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.

(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 10 for additional information.
(d) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive
(negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.

(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value

hedging relationships.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of contractually specified floating-rate (e.g., LIBOR and SOFR-indexed) assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in

net interest income.

(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of

gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $671 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at
December 31, 2021, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been
terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is
approximately eight years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately six years. The Firm’s
longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses
The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting

Credit derivatives
Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a
third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow
one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to
another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives
expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of
the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to
make payments under the contract when the reference
entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a
failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of
credit protection receives a premium for providing
protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument
referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.

The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the
credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two
primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker,
the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives
by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly
on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of
customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit
derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending
exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its
wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives
counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to
manage the credit risk arising from certain financial
instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses.
Following is a summary of various types of credit
derivatives.

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk
management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated
in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage
risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities,
including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments,
warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the

interest rate risk inherent in mortgage commitments, warehouse loans
and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees
and related income.

(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated

with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These
derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is
included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.

(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain
risks associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk
management categories above are included in this
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer
to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

207

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Credit default swaps
Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single
reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based index or
portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both
single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name
CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared
derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage
the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS
contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with
the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like
the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists
of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New
series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new
underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes
in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the
index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity
that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be
referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or
against customized exposure levels based on specific client
demands: for example, to provide protection against the
first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million
portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known
as tranche CDS.

For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS
contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the
terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract
has recourse to the reference entity. The protection
purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the
difference between the face value of the CDS contract and
the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of
the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery
value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the
debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order
to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a
credit event occurs.

Credit-related notes
A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the
issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note
investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index.
Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par
value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in
return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor,
based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer
also repays the investor the par value of the note at
maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities
that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified
credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not
obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the
issuer pays the investor the difference between the par
value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted
reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party
to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting
reference entity.

The following tables present a summary of the notional
amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the
Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2021 and
2020. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection
would typically pay out only a percentage of the full
notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount
actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into
account the recovery value of the reference obligation at
the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on
contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with
identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other
purchased protection referenced in the following tables
includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not
identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio
coverage and other reference points) as well as protection
purchased by CIB through credit-related notes primarily in
its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains
credit protection against certain loans in the retained
consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related
notes. Since these credit-related notes are not part of the
market-making businesses they are not included in the
table below.

208

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives,
because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value
of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the
risks associated with such derivatives.

Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense
Noninterest revenue
The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain
contracts with customers in investment banking fees,
deposit-related fees, asset management, administration,
and commissions, and components of card income. The
related contracts are often terminable on demand and the
Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services.
For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit
to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with
these remaining performance obligations typically depends
on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset
values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those
events or values are known.

Investment banking fees
This revenue category includes debt and equity
underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm
helps clients raise capital via public offering and private
placement of various types of debt and equity instruments.
Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price
and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are
recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the
client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates
loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication
fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded
as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and
yield criteria.

The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its
clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures,
restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees
are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the
client’s transaction.

The following table presents the components of investment
banking fees.

Investment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer
to Note 32 for segment results.

Principal transactions
Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including:
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the
price at which a market participant is willing and able to
sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which
another market participant is willing and able to buy it
from the Firm, and vice versa; and

• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial
instruments and commodities transactions, including
those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily
used in client-driven market-making activities, and on
private equity investments.
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of

instruments, closing out or termination of transactions,
or interim cash payments.

– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in

valuation.

In connection with its client-driven market-making
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments
that reference commodities.

Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and
unrealized gains and losses related to:
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting

relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity
and foreign exchange risk;

• derivatives used for specific risk management purposes,
primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange
risk.

Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income
statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives
activities.

In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in
OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD
that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In
the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily
purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold
other commodities inventories under financing and other
arrangements with clients.

The following table presents all realized and unrealized
gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue.
This table excludes interest income and interest expense on
trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of
the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market-
making activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information
on interest income and interest expense.
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type.
The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses
generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection
with their market-making and related risk-management
activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the
table below is not representative of the total revenue of any
individual LOB.

Lending- and deposit-related fees
Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan
commitments, standby letters of credit, financial
guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. Deposit-
related fees include fees earned from providing overdraft
and other deposit account services, and from performing
cash management activities. Lending- and deposit-related
fees in this revenue category are recognized over the period
in which the related service is provided.

Asset management, administration and commissions
This revenue category includes fees from investment
management and related services, custody, brokerage
services and other products. The Firm manages assets on
behalf of its clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored
funds and owners of separately managed investment
accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value
of assets under management and are collected and
recognized at the end of each period over which the
management services are provided and the value of the
managed assets is known. The Firm also receives
performance-based management fees, which are earned
based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other
performance targets and are accrued and recognized when
the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of
the related billing period. The Firm has contractual
arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and
other services in connection with its asset management
activities. Amounts paid to these third-party service
providers are generally recorded in professional and

outside services expense.

(b) Represents fees for services that are ancillary to investment

management services, such as commissions earned on the sales or
distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as
revenue at the time the service is rendered or, in the case of certain
distribution fees based on the underlying fund’s asset value and/or
investor redemption, recorded over time as the investor remains in the
fund or upon investor redemption.

(c) Predominantly includes fees for custody, securities lending, funds

services and securities clearance. These fees are recorded as revenue
over the period in which the related service is provided.

(d) Represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by
facilitating its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other
financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and
recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The
Firm reports certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and
exchanges net against commission revenue.

Asset management, administration and commissions are
earned primarily by AWM, CIB and CCB. Refer to Note 32 for
segment results.

Mortgage fees and related income
This revenue category reflects CCB’s Home Lending
production and net mortgage servicing revenue.

Production revenue includes fees and income recognized as
earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell,
and the impact of risk management activities associated
with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans.
Production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales
and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage
loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans
insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the
fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair
value option. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes
operating revenue earned from servicing third-party
mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in
which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of
MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated
with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess
mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also
includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair

212

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by
U.S. government agencies.

Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk
management activities and MSRs.

Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in
interest income.

Card income
This revenue category includes interchange and other
income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees
earned from processing card transactions for merchants,
both of which are recognized when purchases are made by
a cardholder and presented net of certain transaction-
related costs. Card income also includes account origination
costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized
on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.

Certain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability
to earn points based on account activity, which the
cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash
rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary
rewards programs varies based on multiple factors
including the terms and conditions of the rewards
programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward
redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The
Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its
rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a
reduction of card income.

Credit card revenue sharing agreements
The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co-
brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue
co-branded credit card products and market them to the
customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co-
brand credit card programs and provide their customer or
member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct
marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under
their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co-
brand credit cardholders based on account activity. The
terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten
years.

The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit
card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing
activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit
cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes.
Payments to partners based on marketing efforts
undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as
incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for
partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a
reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to
partners based on new credit card account originations are
accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are
deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a
straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to
partners based on sales volumes are reported as a
reduction of card income when the related interchange
income is earned.

Interest income and interest expense includes the current-
period interest accruals for financial instruments measured
at fair value, except for derivatives and financial
instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be
separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
absent the fair value option election; for those instruments,
all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are
primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. For
financial instruments that are not measured at fair value,
the related interest is included within interest income or
interest expense, as applicable. Refer to Notes 12, 10, 11
and 20 for further information on accounting for interest
income and interest expense related to loans, investment
securities, securities financing activities (i.e., securities
purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements;
securities borrowed; and securities loaned) and long-term
debt, respectively.

Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement
employee benefit plans
The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and
OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the
U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the
defined benefit pension plans are closed to new
participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in
the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees,
was closed to new participants and frozen for existing
participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for
new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits
continue to accrue to participants’ accounts based on their
accumulated balances.

The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement
benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for
certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their

dependents covered under these programs. None of these
plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan
in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in
certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these
plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the
401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S.
employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings
Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The
Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well as an
annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings
Plan on behalf of eligible participants.

The following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in
AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, was 2.54% and
2.17%, respectively.

Gains and losses
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI.
Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods, if, as of the
beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of
the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen
status of most plans. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net gain was predominantly attributable to a
market-driven increase in the fair value of plan assets and changes in the discount rate.

The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Plan assumptions
The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return is a blended
weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected long-
term returns for the various asset classes, taking into
consideration local market conditions and the specific
allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are
developed using a forward-looking approach and are not
strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given
to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each
plan.

The discount rates used in determining the benefit
obligations are generally provided by the Firm’s actuaries,
with the Firm’s principal defined benefit pension plan using
a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on
portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that
closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows.

Investment strategy and asset allocation
The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are
held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified
portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and
cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The Firm
regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers,
as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios,
which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. The
approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for the
Firm’s principal defined benefit plan are 42-100% debt
securities, 0-40% equity securities, 0-3% real estate, and
0-12% alternatives as of December 31, 2021.

As of December 31, 2021, assets held by the Firm’s defined
benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities
issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through
indirect exposures through investments in exchange traded
funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds
managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension and
OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or
managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of
$2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, as of December 31, 2021 and
2020, respectively.

Fair value measurement of the plans’ assets and liabilities

Changes in level 3 fair value measurements using
significant unobservable inputs
Investments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
increased $220 million in 2021 from $3.0 billion to
$3.2 billion, predominantly due to $332 million in
unrealized gains, partially offset by $94 million in
settlements. In 2020, there was an increase of $263
million, from $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion consisting of
$343 million in unrealized gains and $33 million of
transfers into level 3, partially offset by $118 million in
settlements.

Note 9 – Employee share-based incentives
Employee share-based awards
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, JPMorgan Chase granted long-
term share-based awards to certain employees under its
LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and
subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the
terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2021, 83 million
shares of common stock were available for issuance
through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under
which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive
awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm
plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are
referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans
constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans.

RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their
grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a
rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and
are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting
date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility
provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon
voluntary termination based on age or service-related
requirements, subject to post-employment and other
restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until
vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in
cancellation under certain specified circumstances.
Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash
payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the
underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are
outstanding.

Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually,
and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members
of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable
compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s
achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-
year period. The number of awards that vest can range
from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition,
dividends that accrue during the vesting period are
reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the
related dividend equivalent share units are converted into
shares of common stock after vesting.

Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have
vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after
applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional
two-year period, for a total combined vesting and holding
period of approximately five to eight years from the grant
date depending on regulations in certain countries.

Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and
stock options have generally been granted with an exercise
price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common
stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally
expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm
awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief
Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs,
respectively. There were no material grants of SARs or stock
options in 2020 and 2019.

The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for
each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as
if it were a separate award with its own vesting date.
Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense
is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date
until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided
that the employees will not become full-career eligible
during the vesting period. For awards with full-career
eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future
substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the
estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to
employees as of the grant date without giving consideration
to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each
tranche granted to employees who will become full-career
eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until
the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or
the vesting date of the respective tranche.

The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of
employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either
new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During
2021, 2020 and 2019, the Firm settled all of its employee
share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.

Refer to Note 23 for further information on the
classification of share-based awards for purposes of
calculating earnings per share.

RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity
Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock
price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes
JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity for 2021.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 10 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of
the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and
CIO in connection with its asset-liability management
activities.

AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated
balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any
applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for
credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific
identification method is used to determine realized gains
and losses on AFS securities, which are included in
investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated
statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has
the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at
amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or
premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a
level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security.
However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are
amortized to the earliest call date.

During the second quarter of 2021, the Firm transferred
$104.5 billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for
capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax
unrealized gains of $425 million on the securities at the
date of transfer.

Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these
securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized
into interest income on a level-yield basis over the
remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset
the effect on interest income of the amortization of the
premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at
fair value.

Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash
transactions and are recorded at fair value.

(c) Excludes $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion of accrued interest receivables at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, included in accrued interest and
accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest
receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse through
interest income any accrued interest receivables for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

At December 31, 2021, the investment securities portfolio
consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of
AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and
where not available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality
of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The
Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the
economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s,

however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of
default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”)) may differ as
they reflect internal historical experiences and
assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition,
reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk
Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the
investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s
ability to fulfill its obligations.

AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is
less than the amortized cost.

The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the
Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more
likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt
security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these
circumstances the impairment loss recognized in
investment securities gains/(losses) is equal to the full
difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if
applicable) and the fair value of the security.

For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent
and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to
determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a
credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for
credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the
Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount
of impairment. Any impairment not due to credit losses is
recorded in OCI.

Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include
adverse conditions specifically related to the industry,
geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or
underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of
the security.

When assessing securities issued in a securitization for
credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering
relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level
data, and structural features of the securitization, such as
subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other
forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses
projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”)
against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization
structure to determine whether these features are sufficient
to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.

For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated
below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually
prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm
would not recover substantially all of its recorded
investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses
when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

HTM securities – credit risk

Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses represents expected credit
losses over the remaining expected life of HTM securities.

The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S.
states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed
securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss
factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The
credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of
five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic
scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line
interpolation to revert to long run historical information for
periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for
further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic
forecast.

The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan
obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities
is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost
and the present value of the cash flows expected to be
collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest
rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on
expectations of underlying collateral performance derived
using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the
single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering
the structural features of the security.

The application of different inputs and assumptions into the
calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to
significant management judgment, and emphasizing one
input or assumption over another, or considering other
inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the
allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.

Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the
risk rating assigned to each security. At both December 31,
2021 and 2020, all HTM securities were rated investment
grade and were current and accruing, with approximately
98% rated at least AA+.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each

security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging
derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly,
actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable
debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.

(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency
residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 11 – Securities financing activities
JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities
borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively,
“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the
Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short
sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle
other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess
cash.

Securities financing agreements are treated as
collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance
sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting
guidance, securities financing agreements with the same
counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1
for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and
liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with
securities financing agreements are recorded over the life
of the agreement in interest income and interest expense
on the Consolidated statements of income.

The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain
securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further
information regarding the fair value option. The securities
financing agreements for which the fair value option has
been elected are reported within securities purchased
under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements
carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are
recorded within interest income and interest expense, with
changes in fair value reported in principal transactions
revenue. However, for financial instruments containing
embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted
for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid
instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest
elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.

Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair
value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of
the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below,
the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with
respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as
of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Credit risk mitigation practices
Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily
to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm
monitors the value of the underlying securities
(predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including
government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government
agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its
counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and
exchanged collateral, and either requests additional
collateral or returns securities or collateral when
appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based
upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities,
and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an
ongoing basis.

In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is
exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the
securities received is less than initial cash principal
advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In
repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk
exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying
securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash
principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.

Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting
agreements and other similar arrangements with its
counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the
underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged
in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s
policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities
underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements.
Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets
pledged and collateral received in securities financing
agreements.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of
the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020. When the Firm has obtained
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with
the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance
sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with

securities financing balances that do not meet all these
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net
amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other
assets and the obligation to return those securities within
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm held $440 million and $598 million, respectively, of financial assets for which the
rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading
assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated
balance sheets.

228

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s
strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on
the following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e.,

“retained”)

•

•

Loans held-for-sale

Loans at fair value

The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of
the Firm’s loans by category:

Loans held-for-investment
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment,
including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting
the principal amount outstanding, net of the following:
unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or
discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign
exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance
charges and fees.

Interest income
Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is
accrued and recognized as interest income at the
contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or
premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are
amortized into interest income over the contractual life of
the loan as an adjustment of yield.

The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including
accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in
accrued interest and accounts receivables on the
Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued
interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances,
with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for
credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on
accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the
provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized
by reversing interest income. Expected losses related to
accrued interest on certain performing, modified loans to
borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in the
Firm’s allowance for loan losses. For other loans, the Firm
generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses
on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to
write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing
interest income.

Nonaccrual loans
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest
has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans
and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government
agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered
nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest
is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when
principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90
days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in
the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past
due when the minimum payment is not received from the
borrower by the contractually specified due date or for

certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a
monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more.
Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained
on nonaccrual status.

On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all
interest accrued but not collected is reversed against
interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred
amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans
may be recognized as cash interest payments are received
(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is
deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt
regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan
balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the
carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For
consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in
the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual
consumer loans on a cash basis.

A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is
reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated
performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable,
the terms of the restructured loan.

As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are
generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status;
accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans
continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in
full.

Allowance for loan losses
The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated
expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan
portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the
balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized
cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for
loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on
the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to
Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting
policies for the allowance for loan losses.

Charge-offs
Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down
to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable
value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less
estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for
loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency
in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC.
Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans
and scored business banking loans are generally charged
off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and
modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120
days past due.

Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to
their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off
standards in certain circumstances as follows:

•

Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be
collateral-dependent.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

229

Loans held-for-sale
Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair
value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest
revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on
a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is
performed on an individual loan basis.

Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and
recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.

Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts
or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the
related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and
discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the
loan and therefore are included in the periodic
determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments
and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.

Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or
fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-
off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans
held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies
described above.

Loans at fair value
Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are
measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded
in noninterest revenue.

Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized
based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair
value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan
origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest
revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the
associated expense category as incurred.

Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s
allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not
apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are
subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.

Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s
elections of fair value accounting under the fair value
option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information
on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading
assets.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

•

Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that
suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are
subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,
residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or
charged down within 60 days of receiving notification of
a bankruptcy filing).

• Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile.

Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm
typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-
guaranteed portion of loans.

Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain
that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether
to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including
the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy,
expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and
valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral.

When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized
cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying
collateral, the determination of the fair value of the
collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities,
real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of
liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market
prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other
financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally
estimated using a discounted cash flow model.

For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based
upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely
that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the
Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an
automated valuation model of the home based on an
exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then
updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently
depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable
after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt
(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm
generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that
includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”).
Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted
based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation
values as compared with the estimated values provided by
exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-
specific factors.

For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are
generally based on appraisals from internal and external
valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated
every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new
appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in
accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers
both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may
result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price
opinions at more frequent intervals.

230

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

The Firm granted various forms of assistance to customers
and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including
payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The
majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications
have not been considered TDRs because:

•

•

they represent short-term or other insignificant
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan
modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory
guidance, or

the Firm elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance
under the option provided by the CARES Act, as
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act and
which expired on January 1, 2022.

To the extent that certain modifications did not meet any of
the above criteria, the Firm accounted for them as TDRs.

As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm did not place
loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on
nonaccrual status where such loans were not otherwise
reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considered expected
losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all
COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for
credit losses.

Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual
status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would
have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.

Foreclosed property
The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan
restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property
acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real
estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal
property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).

The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving
assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or
physical possession). For loans collateralized by real
property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received
at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed
assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated
balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less
estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the
acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to
the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to
fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue.
Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and
maintenance, are charged to other expense.

Foreclosures have resumed after having been temporarily
suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Loan classification changes
Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that
management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-
sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date
of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the
allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as
those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency
exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.

In the event that management decides to retain a loan in
the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the
held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date
of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for
impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology.
Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the
methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for
loan losses.

Loan modifications
The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with
its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification,
JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a
borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to
minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or
repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize
payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The
concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-
specific characteristics, and may include interest rate
reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal
forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in
lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and
reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other
insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions are not TDRs.

Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are
generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many
cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to
modification. These loans may be returned to performing
status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following
criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the
modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six
payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that
repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based
on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of
future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other
current market considerations. In certain limited and well-
defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the
modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual
status at the time of modification.

Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for
impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific
allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-
default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a
TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific
component of the allowance throughout its remaining life,
regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been
returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further
discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s
asset-specific allowance.

as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Firm
typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable
requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.

(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $25.8 billion, $16.3 billion and $16.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,

respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards.

Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-
related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue was $261 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 of which $253 million was related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and
lending-related commitments was $(43) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 of which $(36) million was related to
loans. Net gains on sales of loans was $394 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the sale of loans may
also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans,
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market.
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only
payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may
result in negative amortization.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator
for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past
due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be
experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be
unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues
to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely
to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential
real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than
150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will
ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation
transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit
quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the
class of loan, as follows:

For residential real estate loans, the current estimated
LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior
lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in
the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV
ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued
willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV
loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the
borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic
distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as
to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as
the regional economy, home price changes and specific
events such as natural disasters, will affect credit
quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO
score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain
loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s
credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a
low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of
higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO
score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV
ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default
than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio
and a high FICO score.

•

For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic
distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of
the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans,
geographic distribution provides insights into the
portfolio performance based on regional economic
activity and events.

million; 30–149 days past due included $11 million and $16 million; and 150 or more days past due included $20 million and $24 million at
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their

deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(c) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $31 million and $40

million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien
position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in
accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower
(“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2021, approximately 7% of Chapter 7
residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-

dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying
collateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $172 million and $161 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19

payment related deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and
interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, these balances were
no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or
more days past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum,
quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and
forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as
unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been

included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(j) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(k) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2021.
(l) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $66 million and $76 million, respectively. These amounts have

been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans, where the
Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported
as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not
TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option
provided by the CARES Act. The carrying value of new TDRs
was $866 million, $819 million and $490 million for the
years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend
to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been
modified in TDRs.

principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise
have been required under the terms of the original
agreement. The following table provides information about
how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs
under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7
loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of
debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions, and

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction.
Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.

At December 31, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified
in TDRs were 4 years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and
involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Active and suspended foreclosure
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government
agencies, with a carrying value of $619 million and $846 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the
process of active or suspended foreclosure.

(a) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their

deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(b) At December 31, 2021, auto and other loans excluded $667 million of PPP loans guaranteed by the SBA that are 30 or more days past due. These

amounts have been excluded based upon the SBA guarantee. At December 31, 2020, all PPP loans guaranteed by the SBA were current.

(c) At December 31, 2021, included $4.4 billion of loans originated in 2021 and $1.0 billion of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP.
PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual
nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans.

(d) At December 31, 2020, included $19.2 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP.

Loan modifications
Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered
to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to
borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans
with short-term or other insignificant modifications that
are not considered concessions are not TDRs.

The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs,
were not material to the Firm for the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been
modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2021 and 2020
were not material.

(a) At December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $506 million of
PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of
which $35 million is no longer accruing interest based on the
guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal balance of the loans is
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate
subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. There were no loans
that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past
due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In

accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves
subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be
negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was
not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on
the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31,

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans
originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates
are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans
as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be
experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on
those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer
period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In
addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of
the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the
portfolio based on the regional economy.

While the borrower’s credit score is another general
indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit
scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the
borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The

distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of
credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score

does not capture all factors that would be predictive of
future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score
information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a
statistically significant random sample of the credit card
portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is
considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.

The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime
consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO
scores may decrease over time, depending on the
performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit
score calculation.

The following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained credit card
loans.

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer loan modification programs granting
concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.
Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-term
programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions are not TDRs.

If the cardholder does not comply with the modified
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.
For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than
1% of total retained credit card loans.

in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they
defaulted.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified
credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients,
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to
high-net-worth individuals.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is
the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings
are used to identify the credit quality of loans and
differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans
consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a
loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan
that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and
takes into consideration collateral and structural support
for each credit facility.

Management considers several factors to determine an
appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt
capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s
earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level
and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the
industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The
Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the
economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s,
however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD)
may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and
assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings
with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or
higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower
PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.

Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as
noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is
further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans,
representing management’s assessment of the collectibility
of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD
than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized
aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of
criticized exposures, which consist of special mention,
substandard and doubtful categories.

Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by
Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for
updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill
its obligations.

As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the
industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As
part of the overall credit risk management framework, the
Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its
industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid
to industries with actual or potential credit concern. Refer
to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.

within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. The credit quality of wholesale
loans is assessed primarily through ongoing review and monitoring of an obligor’s ability to meet contractual obligations rather than relying on the past

(a) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management

framework. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of these loans were considered performing.

(b) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically

occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs
nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act.
New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $881 million, $734 million and $407 million,
respectively. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 reflected deferral of principal and
interest payments, extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan predominantly in Other
and Commercial and Industrial loan classes. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the
Firm for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The carrying value of TDRs was $607 million and $954 million
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which is recognized within investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance
for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit
losses.
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit
losses is complex and requires significant judgment by
management about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses
is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the
Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures,
considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and
other factors then prevailing, may result in significant
changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods.
The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan
losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments
are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10
for a description of the policies used to determine the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-
related commitments
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-
related commitments represents expected credit losses
over the remaining expected life of retained loans and
lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally
cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for
future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related
commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to
accrued interest on credit card loans and certain
performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by
COVID-19 are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan
losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on
other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write
these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by
reversing interest income.

The expected life of each instrument is determined by
considering its contractual term, expected prepayments,
cancellation features, and certain extension and call
options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is
generally estimated by considering expected future
payments on the credit card account, and determining how
much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments

of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date)
versus other account activity. This allocation is made using
an approach that incorporates the payment application
requirements of the Credit Card Accountability
Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying
down the highest interest rate balances first.

The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected
recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to
be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative
allowance.

Collective and Individual Assessments
When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the
allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm
assesses whether exposures share similar risk
characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm
estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering
the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability
that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or
default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to
significant management judgment. Emphasizing one
characteristic over another or considering additional
characteristics could affect the allowance.
• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio
include product type, delinquency status, current FICO
scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized
loans, current LTV ratios.

• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio
include LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency status,
level and type of collateral, industry, credit enhancement,
product type, facility purpose, tenor, and payment terms.

The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk
characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result
are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based
component”). The portfolio-based component covers
consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain
lending-related commitments.

If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other
exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit
losses on an individual basis, considering expected
repayment and conditions impacting that individual
exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific
component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or
reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-
dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been
placed on nonaccrual status.

Portfolio-based component
The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative
calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower
changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating
to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected
credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is
estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s
estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors
incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as
loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using

248

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated
with improvements in the fair value of collateral).

The asset-specific component of the allowance for loans
that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs
incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s
expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal
forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the
potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans
modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm
develops product-specific probability of default estimates,
which are applied at a loan level to compute expected
losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm
considers the relationship between the credit quality
characteristics of the underlying loans and certain
assumptions about housing prices and unemployment,
based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its
own historical loss experience to-date based on actual
redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified
in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses
incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based
on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification
program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be
modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate
management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to
repay under the modified terms.

Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is
highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon
estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default
rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the
amounts and timing of interest or principal payments
(including any expected prepayments) or other factors that
are reflective of current and expected market conditions.
These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as
the duration of current overall economic conditions,
industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the
expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in
certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these
estimates and assumptions require significant management
judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

a weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast
period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation
to revert to long run historical information for periods
beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five
macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative
adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme
upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central
forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from
subject matter experts across the Firm, and market
consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates
feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate
Finance and Risk Management.

The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are
not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are
accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss
experience, including during stressed periods, for each
major product or model. Management applies judgment in
making this adjustment, including taking into account
uncertainties associated with the economic and political
conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower
behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an
industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant
internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of
the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships
between these factors create further uncertainties.

The application of different inputs into the quantitative
calculation, and the assumptions used by management to
adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant
management judgment, and emphasizing one input or
assumption over another, or considering other inputs or
assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for
loan losses and the allowance for lending-related
commitments.

Asset-specific component
To determine the asset-specific component of the
allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those
loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger,
nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio
segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller
loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for
evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of
assets.

The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as
the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and
the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected,
discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate.
Subsequent changes in impairment are generally
recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan
losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of
collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine
the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the
amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or
the amount of negative allowance that should be

(a) Represents the impact to allowance for credit losses upon the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. Refer to Note 1 for further information.
(b) Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated
losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying
loan was removed from a pool.

(c) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-
collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been

250

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be
modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(e) At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, lending-related commitments excluded $15.7 billion, $19.5 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively, for the

consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $730.5 billion, $658.5 billion and $650.7 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment;
and $32.1 billion, $25.3 billion and $24.1 billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-
related commitments. Prior-period amount for wholesale lending-related commitments, including the amount not subject to allowance, has been revised
to conform with the current presentation.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021
was $18.7 billion, a decrease from $30.8 billion at
December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for
credit losses was primarily driven by improvements in the
macroeconomic environment, consisting of:

• a $9.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in

the credit card portfolio; and

• a $2.6 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. As of December 31, 2021, the
Firm assigned more balanced weightings to both its adverse
and upside scenarios compared to the significant weighting
that the Firm placed on its adverse scenarios as of
December 31, 2020, reflecting the sustained improvement
and resilience of the macroeconomic environment, despite
the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition,
because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic
caused a dislocation in certain historical relationships used
for modeling credit loss estimates, the Firm continues to
place reliance on management judgment and make
adjustments specific to that dislocation, although to a lesser
extent than in 2020. The allowance for credit losses of
$18.7 billion reflects remaining uncertainties, including the
potential impact that additional waves or variants of
COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic growth and
near-term supply chain disruptions.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and year over year growth in U.S. real
GDP as follows:

focused measure of the cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from pre-
pandemic conditions at December 31, 2019. Prior periods have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future
periods.

Refer to Note 1 on page 165 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.

The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a
“Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE
is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name;
or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent,
as follows:

• Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the

funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively
priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable
interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.

•

•

Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain
third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and
does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally
limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-
party transaction.

Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally
subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including
VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of
VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant
activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio.

In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to pages
257-258 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs sponsored by third
parties.

Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities

Credit card securitizations
CCB’s Card business may securitize originated credit card
loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the
“Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card
securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining
an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining
certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining
escrow accounts.

The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its
sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on
the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs
through its servicing responsibilities and other duties,
including making decisions as to the receivables that are
transferred into those trusts and as to any related
modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and

extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the
trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb
losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain
benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be
significant.

The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other
assets of the securitization trusts are available only for
payment of the beneficial interests issued by the
securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s
other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors.

The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts
require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest
in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm held undivided
interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts
of $7.1 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. The Firm

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

253

Notes to consolidated financial statements

maintained an average undivided interest in principal
receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 57%
and 39% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and
2020, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior
securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated
securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at
both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Firm’s undivided
interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are
eliminated in consolidation.

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages
and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well
as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial
interests in the securitization trusts.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization
entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing
involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be
held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain
instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $131 million and
$41 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other
securitization trusts consisted of $3.5 billion and $2.0 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $929 million and $753 million of
noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are
client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group
of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For
these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the
decision-making power of the entity is shared between the
Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and
decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its
assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client
holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does
not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re-
securitization VIEs during 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively, and retained interests in any such Firm-
sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were
immaterial.

Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of
third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally
purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these
circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability
to direct the most significant activities of the re-
securitization trust, either because it was not involved in
the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with
an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated
shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the
Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

Residential mortgage
The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated
by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased
from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally
retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it
originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans
purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by
CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant
activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions
related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also
retain an interest upon securitization.

In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading
activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored
securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior
and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests
and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at
the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the
secondary market in the normal course of business. In
certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or
reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when
considered together with the servicing arrangements
entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary
beneficiary of certain securitization trusts.

The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage
securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored)
when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the
power to direct the most significant activities of the trust)
or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could
potentially be significant to the trust.

Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations
CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans,
and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving
the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain
unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at
the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not
service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO
may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For
commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct
the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the
servicer or investors in a specified class of securities
(“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an
interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial
mortgage securitization transactions.

Re-securitizations
The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in
which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange
for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in
connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency
sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages.
The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on
the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm did not

securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-
securitization VIEs.

Multi-seller conduits
Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy
remote entities that provide secured financing,
collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial
assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their
financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated
commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the
commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets.
In most instances, the assets are structured with deal-
specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by
the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-
specific credit enhancements are generally structured to
cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of
assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization
provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit
enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its
agreements with the conduits.

To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and
to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to
customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain
funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool
financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-
specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also
provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted
program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit
enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The
amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is
based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates
10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.

The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the
significant activities of the conduits and a potentially
significant economic interest in the conduits. As
administrative agent and in its role in structuring
transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset
types and credit quality, and manages the commercial
paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests
that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the
fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and
program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the
potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit
enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.

In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held
$13.7 billion and $13.5 billion of the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which have
been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments
reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not
driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts
required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules,
the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase
the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits.

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were
$13.4 billion and $12.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and
2020, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments in other unfunded
commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more
information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”)
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB
transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal
bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing
two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate
certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate
residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically
purchased by money market funds or other short-term
investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the
TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor
seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB
transactions where the residual is held by a third-party
investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and
non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the
Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are
sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for
all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide
various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing
agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing
agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent
is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on
the floaters, conducting the initial placement and
remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may,
but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters
held by the Firm were not material during 2021 and 2020.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider
for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to

256

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

perform is conditional and is limited by certain events
(“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure
to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement
provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or
the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below
investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s
exposure is typically further limited by the high credit
quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess
collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions,
the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.

Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters
to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot
successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the
liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for
the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly
purchases the tendered floaters.

TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities.
The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as
the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic
performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the
right to receive benefits and bear losses that could
potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.

Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,
and commercial mortgages. The purposes of these
securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand
and to generate liquidity for the Firm.

For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to
consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the
loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the
following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the
transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the
Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest
holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial
assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control
over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot
repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and
it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder
to return the transferred assets).

For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm
recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between
the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial
interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying
value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations
are reported in noninterest revenue.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the
quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a
variable interest that could potentially be significant, the
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance
sheets in the same manner it would record and report
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.

Tax credit vehicles
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A
third party is typically the general partner or managing
member and has control over the significant activities of the
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by
equity investments and funding commitments, was $26.8
billion and $23.6 billion, of which $9.4 billion and $8.7
billion was unfunded at December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure
amount has been revised to conform with the current
presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce
the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital
investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer
to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing
tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In
those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the
Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for
any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect
Residual holders from potential losses on any of the
underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the
power to make decisions that significantly impact the
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The
Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to
customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was
$6.8 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. The fair value of
assets held by such VIEs at both December 31, 2021 and
2020 was $10.5 billion.

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization
activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g.,
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed
by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional
information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-
related indemnifications. Refer to Note 15 for additional

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain
loans due to material breaches of representations and
warranties as discussed in Note 28, the Firm also has the
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan

pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or
guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage
loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Substantially all of

Note 15 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business
combination as the difference between the purchase price
and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and can be
adjusted up to one year from the acquisition date as more
information is obtained about the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to initial
recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or
more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse
changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be
an impairment.

The goodwill associated with each business combination is
allocated to the related reporting units, which are generally
determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are
managed and how they are reviewed. The following table
presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business
segments and Corporate.

Goodwill impairment testing
The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted new
accounting guidance related to goodwill impairment testing.
The adoption of the guidance requires recognition of an
impairment loss when the estimated fair value of a
reporting unit falls below its carrying value. It eliminated
the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only

if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below
its carrying value.

The goodwill impairment test is generally performed by
comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with
its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the
carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is
considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than
the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized
for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value
exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit.

The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus
goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the
carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the
goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is
determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to
the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors
including capital levels of similarly rated peers and
applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB
capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual
budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of
Directors. Allocated capital is further reviewed periodically
and updated as needed.

The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value
of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach
projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the
perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values.
These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted
using an appropriate discount rate. Projections of cash
flows are based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts
which are reviewed with senior management of the Firm.
The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents
an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and
is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost
of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model),
as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each
reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or
uncertainty associated with the business or management’s
forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness
of the discount rates used for each reporting unit,
management compares the discount rate to the estimated
cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar
businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the
weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various
reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall
estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The
valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis
are then compared with market-based trading and
transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and
transaction comparables are used as general indicators to
assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair
values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be
drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between
the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions.

Management also takes into consideration a comparison
between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

261

Notes to consolidated financial statements

units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In
evaluating this comparison, management considers several
factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a
market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of
execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do
not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term
market volatility and other factors that do not directly
affect the value of individual reporting units.

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated
fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the
future, which could result in a material impairment charge
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the
associated goodwill.

Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows
for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary
revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and
generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are
received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against
contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are
either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale
or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.

As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account
for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a
single class of servicing assets based on the availability of
market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR
asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for
risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair
value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”)
model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest
rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment
model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted
rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics,
contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment
assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late
charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic
factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and
assumptions to observable market data where available,
and also considers recent market activity and actual
portfolio experience.

262

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest
rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs
typically decrease in value when interest rates decline
because declining interest rates tend to increase
prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the
net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset.
Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities),
and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm

receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value
when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses
combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the
risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to
offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of
MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk
management instruments.

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Note 16 – Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment, including leasehold
improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes
depreciation using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold
improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method
computed over the lesser of the remainder of the lease
term, or estimated useful life of the improvements.

JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with
the acquisition or development of internal-use software.
Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s
expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an
ongoing basis.

Note 18 - Leases
Firm as lessee
At December 31, 2021, JPMorgan Chase and its
subsidiaries were obligated under a number of
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for
premises and equipment used primarily for business
purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or
less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the
lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or
terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain
that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease
terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease
liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset.
None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the
Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity
financing transactions or enter into further lease
agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation
clauses that will increase rental payments based on
maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease
components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and
non-lease components of a contract for its real estate
leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent
payments on both lease and non-lease components.

Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at
the lease commencement date based on the present value
of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term.
The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that
represents the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for
financing instruments of a similar term and are included in
accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease
ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also
includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct
costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental
expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally
included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated
statements of income.

Firm as lessor
The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its
customers through lease arrangements with lease terms
that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase
options. The Firm’s lease financings are predominantly auto
operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases
are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis
over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated
residual value. Depreciation expense is included in
technology, communications and equipment expense in the
Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease
income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term and is included in other income in the
Consolidated statements of income.

On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for
impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset
exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease
payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition
of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized.

The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets
relating to the residual value of the leased assets is
monitored through projections of the asset residual values
at lease origination and periodic review of residual values,
and is mitigated through arrangements with certain
manufacturers or lessees.

subject to leases reported on the Consolidated balance

(a) The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, including non-U.S. dollar

fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if
applicable. The interest rates shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.

(b) Included long-term debt of $14.1 billion and $17.2 billion secured by assets totaling $170.6 billion and $166.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020,

(d) Included $15.8 billion and $16.1 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The aggregate principal amount

of these notes at their respective maturities is $46.4 billion and $45.3 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable.

(e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $12 million and $41 million accounted for at
fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $8.2 billion
and $12.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total
long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at
fair value were 2.67% and 2.89% as of December 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively. In order to modify exposure
to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements,
JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily
interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in
conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of
these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on
the associated debt. The modified weighted-average
interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects
of related derivative instruments, were 1.43% and 1.59%
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term
debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These
guarantees rank on parity with the Firm’s other unsecured
and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such
guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $16.4
billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements
that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities
or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any
limitations on future borrowings or require additional
collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s
credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021.
Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase
program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal
Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends
in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and
could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for
the four preceding calendar quarters.

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the
temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire
on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the
2021 CCAR stress test. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm
became subject to the normal capital distribution
restrictions provided under the regulatory capital
framework. The Firm continues to be authorized to
repurchase common shares under its existing common
share repurchase program previously approved by the
Board of Directors.

The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of
common stock for the years ended December 31, 2021,
2020 and 2019.

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused

by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended
repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve
directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share
repurchases through the end of 2020.

The authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized
at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases
and the exact amount of common shares that may be
repurchased is subject to various factors, including market
conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the
amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital
position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles);
internal capital generation; and alternative investment
opportunities. The repurchase program does not include
specific price targets or timetables; may be suspended by
management at any time; and may be executed through
open market purchases or privately negotiated
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are
written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from
time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its
common shares during periods when it may otherwise not
be repurchasing common shares —for example, during
internal trading blackout periods.

As of December 31, 2021, approximately 58.3 million
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under
various employee incentive, compensation, option and
stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 23 – Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the
two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings
(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common
stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants
RSUs under its share-based compensation programs,
predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive
nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a
basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s
common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of
participating securities based on their respective rights to
receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a
separate class of securities in computing basic EPS.
Participating securities are not included as incremental
shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for
additional information.

Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of
contingently issuable shares, including awards which
require future service as a condition of delivery of the
underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under
both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the
more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods
presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under
the two-class method was more dilutive.

The following table presents the calculation of net income
applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted
EPS for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and

Note 25 – Income taxes
JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan
Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide income
taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. This method requires that income
taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly,
a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary
difference is determined based on the tax rates that the
Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of
income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s
expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred
portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is
established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the
Firm expects to realize.

Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of
the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and
being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions,
significant judgments and estimates are required to be
made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase
and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax
returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the
Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately
be different from those currently reported.

In the first quarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified certain
deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and
other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the
carrying value of the associated tax-oriented investments.
The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income
tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income,
with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have
been revised to conform with the current presentation,
including the Firm’s effective income tax rate.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Affordable housing tax credits
The Firm recognized $1.7 billion of tax credits and other tax
benefits associated with investments in affordable housing
projects within income tax expense for the year ended
2021, and $1.5 billion in each of the years ended 2020 and
2019. The amount of amortization of such investments
reported in income tax expense was $1.3 billion, $1.2
billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The carrying value of
these investments, which are reported in other assets on
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $10.8 billion
and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. The amount of commitments related to these
investments, which are reported in accounts payable and
other liabilities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets,
was $4.6 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2021
and 2020, respectively.

Deferred taxes
Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from
differences between assets and liabilities measured for
financial reporting purposes versus income tax return
purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in
management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to
be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is
determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is
established. The significant components of deferred tax
assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table.

federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards and other tax
attributes, FTC carryforwards, and state and local capital
loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2021, total U.S.
federal NOL carryforwards were $972 million, non-U.S. NOL
carryforwards were $210 million, FTC carryforwards were
$258 million, state and local capital loss carryforwards
were $1.1 billion, and other U.S. federal tax attributes were
$359 million. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal
NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax attributes will
expire between 2026 and 2037 whereas others have an
unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S.
NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2036
whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The
FTC carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2030, and
the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire in
2022.
The valuation allowance at December 31, 2021, was due to
the state and local capital loss carryforwards, FTC
carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets,
including NOL carryforwards.

expense and penalties, were $4.6 billion, $4.3 billion and
$4.0 billion, respectively, of which $3.4 billion, $3.1 billion
and $2.8 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce
the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not
affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the
Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized
items include the tax effect of certain temporary
differences, the portion of gross state and local
unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the
benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions,
and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits
that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan
Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing
authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service as
summarized in the Tax examination status table below. As
JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of
taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that over the
next 12 months the resolution of these examinations may
increase or decrease the gross balance of unrecognized tax
benefits by as much as approximately $300 million. Upon
settlement of an audit, the change in the unrecognized tax
benefit would result from payment or income statement
recognition.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, in addition to the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $1.1
billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, for income tax-related
interest and penalties.

Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted
assets and intercompany funds transfers
Restricted cash and other restricted assets
Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by
various regulatory authorities based on the particular
activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries.

The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to
examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a
member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its
deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to
applicable limits.
The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain
non-US central banks.

The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established
by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements,
the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain
restrictions on cash and other assets.

The following table presents the components of the Firm’s
restricted cash:

$1.3 billion and $1.7 billion in cash and due from banks on the
Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

Also, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Firm had the
following other restricted assets:

• Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations
for the benefit of customers of $47.5 billion and $37.2
billion, respectively.

• Securities with a fair value of $30.0 billion and $1.3

billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to
customer activity.

Intercompany funds transfers
Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of
its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified
amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking
subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular
affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such
affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”),
must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent
with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless
collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations,
covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the
banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-
based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered
transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its
affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total
capital.

The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings
LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC
generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries
other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries.
The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany
loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is
obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net
proceeds received from securities issuances (including
issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of
preferred and common stock).

The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent
Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In
addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and
regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have
authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to
prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking
organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company
and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding
companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment
of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound
practice in light of the financial condition of the banking
organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or
extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or
liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise
imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of
Directors.

At January 1, 2022, the Parent Company’s banking
subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $20
billion in dividends to their respective bank holding
companies without the prior approval of their relevant
banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2022
will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings
during the year.

Note 27 – Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and
banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches
are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based
capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of
the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to
their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.
The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel
III rules are as illustrated below:

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to
maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to
these capital requirements established by their respective
primary regulators.

The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to
which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements each
include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of
3.5% as calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.2% SCB for Basel III
Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to
0% by the federal banking agencies.

(b) For the period ended December 31, 2020, the CET1, Tier 1, and Total

capital ratio requirements under Basel III Standardized applicable to
the Firm were 11.3%, 12.8% and 14.8%, respectively.

(c) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The

CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital
conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI
subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.

(d) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to

regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.

(e) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations

issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.

Current Expected Credit Losses
The Firm elected to apply the CECL capital transition
provisions as permitted by the federal banking agencies
delaying the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two
years until January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year
transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”).

As of December 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm
reflected the benefit of the CECL capital transition

provisions of $2.9 billion, which will be phased in at 25%
per year beginning January 1, 2022.

The CECL capital transition provisions have also been
incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets,
and total leverage exposure and are also subject to the
three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022.

The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of December 31, 2021

Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and
other commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The
contractual amount of these financial instruments
represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most
of these commitments and guarantees have historically
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements.

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments
is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments. The following table summarizes the
contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance
sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and
other commitments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The
amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity
lending-related commitments represent the total available
credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced,
and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for
these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm
can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law,
without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit
card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due.
The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are
significant decreases in the value of the underlying
property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in
the creditworthiness of the borrower.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally
consist of commitments for working capital and general
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing
organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of
credit.

Guarantees
U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to
the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that
contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed
party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset,
liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a
third party’s failure to perform under a specified
agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance
sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP:
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees,
securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification
agreements included within third-party contractual
arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the
guarantees under the sponsored member repo program.

As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records
guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-
contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of
consideration received or the net present value of the
premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm
records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an
offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received),

or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium
receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is
received under the contract, and the fair value of the
liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as
lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the
guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent
obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in
addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent
obligation.

Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized
when the liability becomes probable and reasonably
estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the
estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any
non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted
for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related
contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in
sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is
allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss
that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these
indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income
as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the
indemnification expires).

The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees
and indemnifications are included in the table on page 284.

For additional information on the guarantees, see below.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are
conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings,
trade financings and similar transactions.

The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Securities lending indemnifications
Through the Firm’s securities lending program,
counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial
arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this
program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the
lending agreements which protects the lender against the
failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To
minimize its liability under these indemnification
agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid
collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value
of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is
marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization
is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the
borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released
to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a
borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to
purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit
the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent
thereof.

The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on
behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements,
whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of
principal invested. To minimize its liability under these
agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value
exceeding 100% of the principal invested.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These
contracts include written put options that require the Firm
to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a
specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm
may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet
client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of
written put options are typically five years or less.

Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable
value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value
products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the
difference between the market value and the book value of
a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event
that market value is less than book value and certain other
conditions have been met. Stable value products are
transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment
returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio.
These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no
stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the
contract under certain conditions.

The notional value of derivative guarantees generally
represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However,
exposure to certain stable value products is contractually
limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional
amount.

The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the
probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be
required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces
exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting
transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the
market risk related to the derivative guarantees.

The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying
as guarantees as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives
market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Unsettled securities financing agreements
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale
and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these
commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and
receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The
Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned
agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the
Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral
to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future
date. These agreements generally do not meet the
definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded
on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date.
These agreements predominantly have regular-way
settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion
of securities financing agreements.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
Mortgage repurchase liability
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are
breached by the Firm.

Private label securitizations
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.

Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding
litigation.

Loans sold with recourse
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain
commercial lending products on both a recourse and
nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal
credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing
advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In
recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk

286

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae
or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor.
Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when
foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a
defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding
principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the
cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property.
The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse,
thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit
losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities
issued by the trust. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the
unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled
$827 million and $889 million, respectively. The carrying
value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of
the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse
obligations, was $19 million and $23 million at
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Other off-balance sheet arrangements
Indemnification agreements – general
In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the
U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the
holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change
in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed
on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities
may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if
such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also
enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the
licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or
when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third-
party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies
software licensees for claims of liability or damages that
may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or
third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to
actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or
assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum
exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since
this would require an assessment of future changes in tax
law and future claims that may be made against the Firm
that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical
experience, management expects the risk of loss to be
remote.

Merchant charge-backs
Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the
transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant

Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-
backs.

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
Merchant Services processed an aggregate volume of
$1,886.7 billion, $1,597.3 billion, and $1,511.5 billion,
respectively.

Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk
The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering
into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts
with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as
well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing
member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its
clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as
well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and
remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part.
There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted
on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative
contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a
derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential
changes in the variation margin requirement for the
contract.

As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of
nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for
the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm
seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection
of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and
throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also
cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to
their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event
of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the
client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP
would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with
any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as
a clearing member.

The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the
client through the recognition of margin receivables from
clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying
securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the
Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible
exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this
would require an assessment of transactions that clients
may execute in the future. However, based upon historical
experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the
Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will
have to make any material payments under these
arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.

Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the
Firm executes for its own account and records in its
Consolidated Financial Statements.

counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are
included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are
reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the
Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for
these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of
any event that would trigger payments by the Parent
Company under these guarantees is remote.

The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and
no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 284 of
this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Exchange & Clearing House Memberships
The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative
exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other
countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients.
Membership in some of these organizations requires the
Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the
organization as a result of the default of another member.
Such obligations vary with different organizations. These
obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of
the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee
fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of
the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a
member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also
include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying
the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses
require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of
losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment
of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin,
unrelated to and independent of the default of another
member. Generally a payment would only be required
should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing
house or exchange that are contractually required to
absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is
difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure
under these membership agreements, since this would
require an assessment of future claims that may be made
against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However,
based on historical experience, management expects the
risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s
maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount
is disclosed in the table on page 284, in the Exchange &
clearing house guarantees and commitments line.

Sponsored member repo program
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements
through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm
minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house;
therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote.
The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments
line on page 284. Refer to Note 11 for additional
information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale
agreements and the types of collateral pledged under
repurchase agreements.

Guarantees of subsidiaries
In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may
provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the
trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a
contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s

288

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Collateral
The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales,
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

The following table presents the fair value of collateral
accepted.

purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically

Note 30 – Litigation
Contingencies
As of December 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and
affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government
investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The
litigations range from individual actions involving a single
plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of
class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by
both governmental agencies and self-regulatory
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve
each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies
and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort
and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel
legal theories.

The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to
approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021. This
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
was based upon information available as of that date for
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
involves significant judgment, given:

•

•

•

•

the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in
preliminary stages,

the existence in many such proceedings of multiple
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability
(if any) has yet to be determined,

the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the
proceedings, including issues regarding class
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and

the attendant uncertainty of the various potential
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may
vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings.

Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is
investigating J.P.Morgan India Private Limited in connection
with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore
funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into
residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali
Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil
claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by
home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to
deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have
been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are
ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P.
Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million.
The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in
July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order
making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other
parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and
the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,
violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P.
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.

Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major
international oil companies. The account held
approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in
accordance with directions received from its clients. In
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)
commenced a claim in the English High Court for
approximately $875 million in payments made out of the
accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the
FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a
complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but
that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on
notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was
unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial commenced in
February 2022.

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm
previously reported settlements with certain government
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and
trading activities and controls related to those activities.
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The
Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year

290

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its
affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional
Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm
will need the Department of Labor to approve a further
exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year
disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only
remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa
Competition Commission matter which is currently pending
before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.

With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a
consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of
persons who transacted in FX futures and options on
futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed
requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and
certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other
foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of
these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class
action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign
exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who
purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates.
Another putative class action was brought against the Firm
and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported
indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court
approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants
of that class action for a total of $10 million. In addition,
some FX-related individual and putative class actions based
on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed
outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the
Netherlands, Brazil and Australia.

Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements. In
December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered
into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective
civil investigations of compliance with records preservation
requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap
dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and
CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain
copies of certain communications required to be maintained
under their respective record keeping rules, where such
communications were sent or received by employees over
electronic messaging channels that had not been approved
for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also
included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan
Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found
related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC paid a $125 million civil monetary
penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc
paid a total $75 million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC.
The Firm continues to respond to requests for information

and other material from certain authorities concerning its
compliance with records preservation requirements in
connection with business communications sent over
electronic messaging channels that have not been approved
by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries.

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York for further proceedings consistent with the
appellate decision.

The original class action was divided into two separate
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the
parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement
which amends and supersedes the prior settlement
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants
collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the
approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from
the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court.
Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval
order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended
class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in
part, and denied the motion in part.

In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those
actions remain pending.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from
various governmental agencies and entities around the
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s
("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject,
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission
issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding
an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to
EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

291

Notes to consolidated financial statements

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along
with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been
dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a
lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and
other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement
to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards.
Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In
December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a
preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from
setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial
instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm’s
settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc
LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the
Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill
Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.

Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and
Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which,
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective
investigations relating to historical trading practices by
former employees in the precious metals and U.S.
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to
2016.

The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after
three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully
comply with all of their obligations.

Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary
amount of approximately $920 million. A portion of the
total monetary amount includes victim compensation
payments.

Several putative class action complaints have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of

New York against the Firm and certain former employees,
alleging a precious metals futures and options price
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court
consolidated these putative class actions, and, in December
2021, the Court preliminarily approved a settlement among
the parties. In addition, several putative class actions were
filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern
District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against
the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and
options, and bringing claims under the Commodity
Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois
were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The
Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in
December 2021, the Court preliminarily approved a
settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have
moved to commence putative class action proceedings
based on similar alleged underlying conduct related to
precious metals.

In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these
putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their
second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally
alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures
contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during
the putative class period were materially false and
misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust
law and New York State common law in connection with an
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous
exchange trading for securities lending transactions.
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which
defendants are opposing.

*     *     *

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to

292

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may
be initiated from time to time in the future.

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on
management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $426 million, $1.1
billion and $239 million for the years ended December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There is no assurance
that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be
adjusted in the future.

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material
legal proceedings described above and after taking into
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating
results for a particular period, depending on, among other
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 31 – International operations
The following table presents income statement and balance
sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major
international geographic area. The Firm defines
international activities for purposes of this footnote
presentation as business transactions that involve clients
residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented
below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client,
the location from which the client relationship is managed,
booking location or the location of the trading desk.
However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve
international businesses.

As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates
and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion
revenue and expense between U.S. and international
operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent
with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting
as set forth in Note 32.

The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are
not considered by management to be significant in relation
to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets
are located in the U.S.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
segment results as of or for the years ended December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019, on a managed basis. The Firm’s
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S.
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. This allows management to
assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year
arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt
items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).
These adjustments have no impact on net income as
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.

Segment results and reconciliation(a)

(Table continued on next page)

Capital allocation
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for
expected returns are established as key measures of a
business segment’s performance.

The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB
surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress
environment. The assumptions and methodologies used to
allocate capital are periodically reassessed and as a result,
the capital allocated to the LOBs may change from time to
time.

Changes in net interest income, volume and rate analysis

The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate
is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding
annual rates (refer to pages 300-304 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change
cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in
market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability.
This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example,
the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in
the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities
involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the

Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the
origination date.

Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data
where actual data is not available. As a result, the
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values;
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to present
revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management
also uses this financial measure at the segment level,

Mortgage origination channels:

Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through
direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the
Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone.
Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by
a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home
builders or other third parties.

Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and
other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm.

Mortgage product types:
Alt-A
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than
subprime loans but have characteristics that would
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A
lending characteristics may include one or more of the
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv)
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date
triggers.

Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have
reliable payment histories.

Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or

poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v)
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas

MSR: Mortgage servicing rights

Multi-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under
management to more than one asset class.

cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs
generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans,
which is recognized over the period in which the service is
provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of
risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains
and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing.
Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and
losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments
of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government
agencies.

Net revenue rate: Represents Credit Card net revenue
(annualized) expressed as a percentage of average loans
for the period.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for
interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all
sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM: Not meaningful

NOL: Net operating loss

Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S.

308

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2021 Form 10-K

Glossary of Terms and Acronyms

government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and
interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or
more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the
process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are
typically maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain
assets acquired in loan satisfaction, predominantly real
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

NOW: Negotiable Order of Withdrawal

NSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio

between two derivative counterparties, where one or both
counterparties is a derivatives dealer.

Over-the-counter cleared (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives:
Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing
house, such that each derivative counterparty is only
exposed to the default of that clearing house.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small
Business Association (“SBA”)

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a
lending institution to generate income in excess of its
provision for credit losses.

Pre-tax margin: Represents income before income tax
expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in
management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs
are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which
management evaluates the performance of AWM against
the performance of their respective competitors.

Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions
revenue is driven by many factors, including:

• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the
price at which a market participant is willing and able to
sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which
another market participant is willing and able to buy it
from the Firm, and vice versa; and

• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial
instruments and commodities transactions, including
those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily
used in client-driven market-making activities, and on
private equity investments.
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of

instruments, closing out or termination of transactions,
or interim cash payments.

– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in

valuation.

Participating securities: Represents unvested share-based
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase
grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period
on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of
common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition
of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all
earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to
each class of common stock and participating securities,
based on their respective rights to receive dividends.

PCA: Prompt corrective action

PCAOB: Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.

In connection with its client-driven market-making
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments
that reference commodities.

Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and
unrealized gains and losses related to:
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting

relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity
and foreign exchange risk;

• derivatives used for specific risk management purposes,
primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange
risk.

Production revenue: Includes fees and income recognized
as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to
sell, and the impact of risk management activities
associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse
loans. Production revenue also includes gains and losses on
sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on
mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain
repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies),
and changes in the fair value of financial instruments
measured under the fair value option.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OF JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE

As of the filing date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Exhibit is attached (the “Form 10-K”), the following outstanding

stock; (ii) six series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares; (iii) the Alerian MLP Index ETN due May 24, 2024; and (iv)
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s guarantee of the Callable Fixed Rate Notes due June 10, 2032 issued by JPMorgan Chase Financial Company
LLC. All references herein to “JPMorgan Chase,” “we” or “us” are to JPMorgan Chase & Co.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK

The following summary is not complete. You should refer to the applicable provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
our By-laws, each of which are incorporated by reference as Exhibits to the Form 10-K, and to the Delaware General Corporation Law
(“DGCL”), for a complete statement of the terms and rights of our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, which we refer to herein
as common stock. We encourage you to read our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which we refer to herein as our certificate of
incorporation, By-laws and the relevant provisions of the DGCL for additional information.

Authorized Shares

We are authorized to issue up to 9,000,000,000 shares of common stock.

Dividends

Holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends if, as and when declared by our board of directors out of funds legally
available for payment, subject to the rights of holders of our preferred stock.

Voting Rights

Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred
stock under its applicable certificate of designations and applicable law, all voting rights are vested in the holders of shares of our
common stock. Holders of shares of our common stock have noncumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than
50% of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect 100% of the directors and the holders of the remaining shares will
not be able to elect any directors.

Rights Upon Liquidation

In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to
share equally in any of our assets available for distribution after we have paid in full all of our debts and after the holders of all series
of our outstanding preferred stock have received their liquidation preferences in full.

Miscellaneous

The issued and outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Holders of shares of our common stock are not
entitled to preemptive rights or to the benefit of any sinking funds. Our common stock is not convertible into shares of any other class
of our capital stock. Computershare Inc. is the transfer agent, registrar and dividend disbursement agent for our common stock.

Listing

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbol “JPM”.

DESCRIPTION OF LISTED PREFERRED STOCK

The following summary is not complete. You should refer to our certificate of incorporation and to the Certificate of Designations,
Powers, Preferences and Rights relating to each series of Listed Preferred Stock (as defined below), which we refer to herein as a
certificate of designations, for the complete terms of that series of preferred stock. Copies of our certificate of incorporation and the
certificate of designations for each series of Listed Preferred Stock are incorporated by reference as Exhibits to the Form 10-K. We
encourage you to read our certificate of incorporation and the relevant certificates of designations for additional information.

Authorized Shares

Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized, without further stockholder action, to issue up to
200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1 par value per share, which we refer herein to as preferred stock, in one or more series,
and to determine the voting powers and the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and

qualifications, limitations or restrictions of each series. We may amend our certificate of incorporation to increase or decrease the
number of authorized shares of preferred stock in a manner permitted by our certificate of incorporation and the DGCL.

Outstanding Preferred Stock

As of the filing date of the Form 10-K, we have 18 series of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The shares of each series of our
preferred stock are represented by depositary shares, with each depositary share representing a fractional interest in a share of
preferred stock of the relevant series. Of the 18 series of our issued and outstanding preferred stock, depositary shares representing
the following six series of preferred stock are registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with each
depositary share representing a 1/400th interest in a share of preferred stock of the relevant series:

•
•
•
•
•
•

5.75% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series DD;
6.00% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series EE;
4.75 Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series GG;
4.55% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series JJ;
4.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series LL; and
4.20% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series MM.

We refer to the above six series of preferred stock herein collectively as the “Listed Preferred Stock”.

The Listed Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable.

The terms of the depositary shares are summarized below under “Description of Depositary Shares”.

Ranking

The Listed Preferred Stock ranks, as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-
up, on a parity with any series of preferred stock ranking on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock
and to any series of preferred stock ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock. The Listed Preferred Stock is subordinate to our
existing and future indebtedness.

Dividend Rights

Holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or any duly authorized
committee of our board, cash dividends at the rates and on the dates described below under “Specific Terms of Listed Preferred
Stock”. We will pay each dividend to the holders of record as they appear on our stock register on record dates determined by our
board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board. Dividends on the Listed Preferred Stock are noncumulative. If a
dividend is not declared on any series of Listed Preferred Stock, because the dividends are noncumulative, then the right of holders of
that series to receive that dividend will be lost, and we will have no obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or
not dividends are declared for any future dividend period.

We may not declare or pay or set aside for payment full dividends on any series of preferred stock ranking, as to dividends, equally
with or junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock unless we have previously declared and paid or set aside for payment, or we
contemporaneously declare and pay or set aside for payment, full dividends on that series of Listed Preferred Stock for the most
recently completed dividend period. When dividends are not paid in full on a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other
series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that series, all dividends declared and paid upon the shares of that
series of Listed Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the that series will be
declared and paid pro rata. For purposes of calculating the pro rata allocation of partial dividend payments, we will allocate dividend
payments based on the ratio between the then-current dividends due on shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and (i) in the case of
any series of non-cumulative preferred stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the
current and unpaid dividends due on such series of preferred stock and (ii) in the case of any series of cumulative preferred stock
ranking on a parity as to dividends with that Listed Preferred Stock, the aggregate of the current and accumulated and unpaid
dividends due on such series of preferred stock.

In addition, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Listed Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or a sum
sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment in respect of the applicable most recently completed dividend period,
with respect to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock:

•

 no dividend (other than a dividend in common stock or in any other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred
Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) will be declared or paid or a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof set aside for such payment or other distribution declared or made upon our common stock or upon any
other capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-
up, and

•

no common stock or other capital stock ranking junior or equally with that Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any
moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such capital stock) by us,
except:

(1) by conversion into or exchange for capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;
(2) as a result of reclassification into capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock;
(3) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of shares of capital stock ranking junior to
that Listed Preferred Stock or, in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock,
through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of capital stock ranking on
a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;

(4) in the case of capital stock ranking on a parity with that Listed Preferred Stock, pursuant to pro rata offers to

purchase all or a pro rata portion of the shares of that Listed Preferred Stock and such capital stock ranking on a
parity with that Listed Preferred Stock;

(5) in connection with the satisfaction of our obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary course

prior to the beginning of the most recently completed dividend period; or

(6) any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of capital stock ranking junior to that Listed Preferred Stock
pursuant to any of our or our subsidiaries’ employee, consultant or director incentive or benefit plans or
arrangements (including any employment, severance or consulting arrangements) adopted before or after the
issuance of that Listed Preferred Stock).

However, the foregoing will not restrict our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to engage in underwriting, stabilization,
market-making or similar transactions in our capital stock in the ordinary course of business. Subject to the conditions described
above, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, capital stock, or otherwise), as may be determined by our board of directors or
a duly authorized committee of our board, may be declared and paid on our common stock and any other capital stock ranking junior
to or on a parity with the Listed Preferred Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the
holders of the Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.

As used herein, “junior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to our common stock and any other class or series of
our capital stock over which the Listed Preferred Stock has preference or priority, either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may require; “parity preferred stock” and “on a parity with a series of Listed
Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks on a parity with the shares of a particular
series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as the context may
require; and “senior to a series of Listed Preferred Stock” and like terms refer to any class or series of our capital stock that ranks
senior to a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or both, as
the context may require.

We will compute the amount of dividends payable by annualizing the applicable dividend rate and dividing by the number of dividend
periods in a year, except that the amount of dividends payable for any period greater or less than a full dividend period, other than
the initial dividend period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and, for any period
less than a full month, the actual number of days elapsed in the period. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be
rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.

Rights Upon Liquidation

In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of each series of Listed Preferred Stock will
be entitled to receive and to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders the amount of $10,000 per
share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of undeclared dividends, before we make any distribution of
assets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the Listed Preferred Stock of such
series. After the payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled, such holders will have no right or
claim to any of our remaining assets.

If, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, we fail to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to
a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock, and any stock having the same rank as that series, the holders of that series and of that
other stock will share ratably in any such distribution of our assets in proportion to the full respective distributions to which they are
entitled. For any series of Listed Preferred Stock, neither the sale of all or substantially all of our property or business, nor our
merger or consolidation into or with any other entity will be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, voluntary of or
involuntary, of us.

Because we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and our stockholders, including the holders of the Listed
Preferred Stock, to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon that subsidiary’s liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or

recapitalization may be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that we are a creditor with
recognized claims against the subsidiary.

Holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are subordinate to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets,
including in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding. In addition, holders of the Listed
Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that we enter into a receivership,
insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.

Redemption

We may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock on the dates and at the redemption prices set forth below under “Specific
Terms of Listed Preferred Stock”. In addition, we may redeem each series of Listed Preferred Stock in whole, but not in part, at a
redemption price equal to $10,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends,
following the occurrence of a capital treatment event. For these purposes, “capital treatment event” means the good faith
determination by JPMorgan Chase that, as a result of any:

•

•

•

amendment to, or change or any announced prospective change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any
political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of
such series of Listed Preferred Stock;
proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares
of such series of Listed Preferred Stock; or
official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or
applying those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any shares of such
series of Listed Preferred Stock,

there is more than an insubstantial risk that JPMorgan Chase will not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the full liquidation
amount of all shares of such series of Listed Preferred Stock then outstanding as “additional Tier 1 capital” (or its equivalent) for
purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency, as then in effect and
applicable, for as long as any share of such series of Listed Preferred Stock is outstanding. Redemption of any Listed Preferred Stock
is subject to our receipt of any required approvals from the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory authority.

If we elect to redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, we will provide notice by first class mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the holders of record of such shares to be redeemed. Such mailing will be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days
before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice so mailed will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the
holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any
holder of shares of the series designated for redemption will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
shares of that series. Each notice of redemption will state:

•
•

•
•

•

the redemption date;
the number of shares of the series of Listed Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such
holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder;
the redemption price;
the place or places where the certificates representing such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price; and
that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the series of Listed Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust
Company, or “DTC”, we may give such notice in any manner permitted or required by DTC. For each series of Listed Preferred Stock,
neither the holders of a series nor the holders of the related depositary shares have the right to require redemption of such series of
Listed Preferred Stock.

In the case of any redemption of only part of the shares a series of Listed Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of the
series to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of that series in proportion to the number of shares
held by such holders or by lot. From and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accumulate on the shares of Listed
Preferred Stock called for redemption up to the redemption date and all rights of the holders of those shares, except the right to
receive the redemption price, will cease.

In the event that we fail to pay full dividends, including accumulated but unpaid dividends, if any, on any series of Listed Preferred
Stock, we may not redeem that series in part and we may not purchase or acquire any shares of that series, except by a purchase or
exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of that series.

Preemptive and Conversion Rights

The Listed Preferred Stock is not subject to any preemptive rights and is not convertible into property or shares of any other class or
series of our capital stock.

Depositary, Transfer Agent, and Registrar

Computershare Inc. is the depositary, transfer agent and registrar for each series of the Listed Preferred Stock and the related
depositary shares.

Voting Rights

Except as indicated below or except as expressly required by applicable law, the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are not entitled
to vote. Each share of Listed Preferred Stock a series is entitled to one vote on matters on which holders of that series are entitled to
vote. The voting power of each series of Listed Preferred Stock depends on the number of shares in that series, and not on the
aggregate liquidation preference or initial offering price of the shares of that series.

If, at any time or times, the equivalent of an aggregate of six quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive, for any series of Listed
Preferred Stock has not been paid, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be automatically increased by two
and the holders of each outstanding series of Listed Preferred Stock with such voting rights, together with holders of such other
shares of any other class or series of parity preferred stock outstanding at the time upon which like voting rights have been conferred
and are exercisable, which we refer to as “voting parity stock,” voting together as a class, will be entitled to elect those additional two
directors, which we refer to as “preferred directors,” at that annual meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders
until full dividends have been paid for at least four quarterly consecutive dividend periods. At that time such right will terminate,
except as expressly provided in the applicable certificate of designations or by law, subject to revesting. Upon any termination of the
right of the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock and voting parity stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the
preferred directors will cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all preferred directors then in office will terminate
immediately and the authorized number of directors will be reduced by the number of preferred directors elected. Any preferred
director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided by law or without cause by the affirmative vote of the
holders of shares of the Listed Preferred Stock, voting together as a class with the holders of shares of voting parity stock, to the
extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. Any vacancy created by removal with or without cause
may be filled only as described in the preceding sentence. If the office of any preferred director becomes vacant for any reason other
than removal, the remaining preferred director may choose a successor who will hold office for the unexpired term in respect of
which such vacancy occurred.

So long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock remains outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series and any voting parity stock, voting together as a class, authorize,
create or issue any capital stock ranking senior to that series as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or
reclassify any authorized capital stock into any such shares of such capital stock or issue any obligation or security convertible into or
evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of capital stock. So long as any shares of a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock
remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of that series,
amend, alter or repeal any provision of the applicable certificate of designations or our certificate of incorporation, including by
merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of that series.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following will be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of
any series of Listed Preferred Stock:

•

•

•

any increase in the amount of authorized common stock or authorized preferred stock, or any increase or decrease in the
number of shares of any series of preferred stock, or the authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of
capital stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to that series of Listed Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;
a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase with or into another entity in which the shares of that series remain
outstanding; and
a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase with or into another entity in which the shares of the that series are converted
into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity or any entity, directly or indirectly, controlling such
surviving entity and such new preference securities have powers, preferences and special rights that are not materially less
favorable than that series;

provided that if the amendment would adversely affect such series but not any other series of preferred stock outstanding, then the
amendment will only need to be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the series of Listed Preferred Stock
adversely affected.

In exercising the voting rights described above or when otherwise granted voting rights by operation of law or by us, each share of
Listed Preferred Stock with respect to a series will be entitled to one vote (equivalent to 1/400th
 of a vote per relevant depositary
share).

If we redeem or call for redemption all outstanding shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock and irrevocably deposit in trust
sufficient funds to effect such redemption, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be

required or upon which the holders of such series will be entitled to vote will be effected, the voting provisions described above will
not apply.

Our board of directors may also from time to time, without notice to or consent of holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock, issue
additional shares of such series. Delaware law provides that the holders of preferred stock will have the right to vote separately as a
class on any amendment to our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations) that would increase or decrease
the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, increase or decrease the par value of such class or adversely affect the
powers, preferences and special rights of the shares of preferred stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as permitted by law, our
certificate of incorporation provides that any increase or decrease in our authorized capital stock may be adopted by the affirmative
vote of holders of capital stock representing not less than a majority of the voting power represented by the outstanding shares of
our capital stock entitled to vote. If any proposed amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of one
or more series of preferred stock so as to affect them adversely, but would not so affect the entire class of preferred stock, only the
shares of the series so affected will be considered a separate class for purposes of this vote on the amendment. This right is in
addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations).

Under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, if the holders of any series of our preferred stock become entitled to vote
for the election of directors because dividends on that series are in arrears, that series may then be deemed a “class of voting
securities.” In such a case, a holder of 25% or more of the series, or a holder of 5% or more if that holder would also be considered
to exercise a “controlling influence” over JPMorgan Chase, may then be subject to regulation as a bank holding company in
accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, (1) any other bank holding company may be required to obtain the prior
approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire or retain 5% or more of that series, and (2) any person other than a bank holding
company may be required to provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring or retaining 10% or more of that series.

Description of Depositary Shares

The following summary of the terms of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed Preferred Stock is not complete.
You should refer to each of the deposit agreements among us, the depositary, and the holders from time to time of the depositary
receipts evidencing the depositary shares relating to each series of the Listed Preferred Stock for the complete terms of those
depositary shares. Each of those deposit agreements has been filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed in connection
with the issuance of the depositary shares representing each series of the Listed Preferred Stock.
General. Each depositary share represents a 1/400th
evidenced by depositary receipts. In connection with the issuance of each series of Listed Preferred Stock, we deposited shares of
that series of Listed Preferred Stock with Computershare Inc., as depositary under the deposit agreement relating to that series of
Listed Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms of each deposit agreement, the depositary shares are entitled to all the powers,
preferences and special rights of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, as applicable, in proportion to the applicable fraction
of a share of Listed Preferred Stock those depositary shares represent.
Dividends and Other Distributions. Each dividend payable on a depositary share will be in an amount equal to 1/400th
declared and payable on the related share of the Listed Preferred Stock.

 interest in a share of the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock, and is

 of the dividend

The depositary will distribute all dividends and other cash distributions received on the relevant series of Listed Preferred Stock to
the holders of record of the related depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder. In the
event of a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to the holders of record of the
depositary receipts as nearly as practicable in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by each holder, unless the
depositary determines that this distribution is not feasible, in which case the depositary may, with our approval, adopt a method of
distribution that it deems practicable, including the sale of the property and distribution of the net proceeds of that sale to the
holders of the depositary receipts.

Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding
record dates for the related shares of Listed Preferred Stock.

The amount paid as dividends or otherwise distributable by the depositary with respect to the depositary shares or the underlying
Listed Preferred Stock will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by us or the depositary on account of taxes or other
governmental charges.

Redemption of Depositary Shares. If we redeem a series of Listed Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time in part, the
corresponding depositary shares also will be redeemed with the proceeds received by the depositary from the redemption of the
Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be 1/400th
share payable with respect to the Listed Preferred Stock, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of
undeclared dividends.

 of the redemption price per

If we redeem shares of a series of Listed Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same
redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing those shares of the Listed Preferred Stock so redeemed. If we

redeem less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary will select pro rata or by lot those depositary shares to be
redeemed. The depositary will mail notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary receipts not less than 30 and not more
than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock and the related depositary shares.

The redemption of depositary shares that are held in book-entry form through DTC will be effected in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC.
Voting the Listed Preferred Stock. Because each depositary share represents a 1/400th
holders of depositary receipts will be entitled to 1/400th
holders of the Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote.

 interest in a share of Listed Preferred Stock,
 of a vote per depositary share under those limited circumstances in which

When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of a series of Listed Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the
depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to that Listed
Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for
the applicable Listed Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock represented by
the holder’s depositary shares. To the extent practicable, the depositary will vote the amount of the Listed Preferred Stock
represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all actions that the depositary
determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from
the holders of any depositary shares representing the Listed Preferred Stock, it will abstain from voting with respect to such shares.

Withdrawal of Listed Preferred Stock. Underlying shares of Listed Preferred Stock may be withdrawn from the depositary arrangement
upon surrender of depositary receipts at the depositary’s office and upon payment of the taxes, charges and fees provided for in the
deposit agreement. Subject to the terms of the relevant deposit agreement, the holder of depositary receipts will receive the
appropriate number of shares of Listed Preferred Stock represented by such depositary shares. Only whole shares of Listed Preferred
Stock may be withdrawn; if a holder holds an amount other than a whole multiple of 400 depositary shares, the depositary will
deliver along with the withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred Stock a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of
depositary shares. Holders of withdrawn shares of Listed Preferred Stock will not be entitled to redeposit such shares or to receive
depositary shares.

Form and Notices. Each series of Listed Preferred Stock was issued in registered form to the depositary, and the depositary shares
representing that Listed Preferred Stock were issued in book-entry only form through DTC. The depositary will forward to the holders
of depositary shares all reports, notices, and communications from us that are delivered to the depositary and that we are required to
furnish to the holders of the Listed Preferred Stock.

Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement. We and the depositary may amend any form of depositary receipt evidencing
depositary shares and any provision of any deposit agreement at any time regarding any depositary shares. However, any
amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares representing a particular series of
Listed Preferred Stock or would be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights granted to holders of that underlying Listed
Preferred Stock pursuant to our certificate of incorporation will not be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the
holders of at least a majority of the related depositary shares then outstanding. The deposit agreement relating to the depositary
shares representing a particular series of Listed Preferred Stock may be terminated by us or by the depositary only if:

•
•

all such outstanding depositary shares have been redeemed; or
there has been a final distribution of the relevant underlying Listed Preferred Stock in connection with our liquidation,
dissolution or winding up and the preferred stock has been distributed to the holders of depositary receipts.

Charges of Depositary. We will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the
depositary arrangements regarding any depositary shares. We also pay charges of the depositary in connection with the initial
deposit of each series of Listed Preferred Stock and any redemption of the Listed Preferred Stock. Holders of depositary receipts will
pay transfer and other taxes and governmental charges and other charges with respect to their depositary receipts as expressly
provided in the deposit agreement.

Resignation and Removal of Depositary. With respect to the depositary shares representing each series of Listed Preferred Stock, the
depositary may resign at any time by delivering a notice to us of its election to do so. We may remove the depositary at any time. Any
such resignation or removal will take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of its appointment.
We must appoint a successor depositary within 60 days after delivery of the notice of resignation or removal.

Miscellaneous. The depositary will forward to holders of applicable depositary receipts all reports and communications from us that
we deliver to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the relevant Listed Preferred Stock.

Neither we nor the depositary will be liable if either of us is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond our control in
performing our respective obligations under any deposit agreement. Our obligations and those of the depositary will be limited to
performing in good faith our respective duties under any deposit agreement. Neither we nor the depositary will be obligated to
prosecute or defend any legal proceeding relating to any depositary shares or Listed Preferred Stock unless satisfactory indemnity is

furnished. We and the depositary may rely upon written advice of counsel or accountants, or upon information provided by persons
presenting preferred stock for deposit, holders of depositary receipts or other persons we believe to be competent, and on
documents we believe to be genuine.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ALERIAN MLP INDEX ETNS DUE MAY 24, 2024

The following description of our Alerian MLP Index ETNs due May 24, 2024 (the “Alerian ETNs”) is a summary and does not purport
to be complete.  It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated May 25, 2001 (as may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, the “2001 Indenture”), between JPMorgan Chase, as issuer, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas (formerly known as Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to
the Form 10-K.  We encourage you to read the 2001 Indenture for additional information.

General

In June 2012, the maximum number of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance was set at 129,000,000, resulting in a maximum
aggregate principal amount of $2,455,722,690.  All of the Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance were issued as of June 2012.
10,000,000 Alerian ETNs were retired on December 16, 2015.  Accordingly, since the retirement of these notes, the maximum
number of Alerian ETNs authorized for issuance is 119,000,000 with an aggregate principal amount of $2,265,356,590, all of which
has been issued and remain outstanding as of December 31, 2019.

The Alerian ETNs are linked to the Alerian MLP Index (the “Index”) and are our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will
rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  The Alerian ETNs do not guarantee any return of
principal at, or prior to, maturity or upon early repurchase.  Any payment on the Alerian ETNs is subject to the credit risk of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The Alerian ETNs are part of a series of our debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series E” (the “Series E Notes”) that
we may issue under the 2001 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the Series E Notes, please see the section
titled “General Terms of the Series E Notes” below.

The Alerian ETNs are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other
governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Alerian ETNs are registered on the books
that we or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests
in the Alerian ETNs (registered in street name or otherwise).

Please see “Certain Defined Terms” below for an explanation of any capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined.

The Index

The return of the Alerian ETNs is linked to the performance of the Index.  The Index measures the composite performance of energy-
oriented Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, and is calculated and maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index
Calculation Agent”), in consultation with GKD Index Partners, LLC (the “Index Sponsor”), using a float-adjusted, market capitalization
methodology.  MLPs are limited partnerships primarily engaged in the exploration, marketing, mining, processing, production,
refining, storage, or transportation of any mineral or natural resource.

Denominations

The Alerian ETNs are denominated in U.S. dollars in minimum denominations equal to the $19.03661 per note (the “Principal
Amount”), which is the amount equal to the Initial VWAP Level (defined below), divided by ten.

Coupon Payments and the Accrued Tracking Fee

For each Alerian ETN a holder holds on the applicable Coupon Record Date, holders will receive on each Coupon Payment Date the
“Coupon Amount,” which is an amount in cash equal to the difference between (a) the Reference Distribution Amount (defined
below), calculated as of the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date and (b) the Accrued Tracking Fee (defined below), calculated as of
the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date.

The Accrued Tracking Fee accrues on a daily basis at a rate of 0.85% per annum, applied to the Daily Note Value as of the Index
Business Day immediately preceding the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date.  The Daily Note Value reflects the cumulative
performance of the VWAP Level of the Index since April 1, 2009, which we refer to as the Inception Date. If the Daily Note Value
increases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will increase, and if the Daily Note Value decreases, the Accrued Tracking Fee will decrease. The
Daily Note Value is published on the Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”) under the ticker symbol “AMJIVWAP” and on
Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol “AMJIVWAP:IND.”

On any Index Business Day, the VWAP Level reflects the weighted VWAPs of the Index Components, and the VWAP of each Index
Component is the volume-weighted average price of one share of that Index Component as determined by the VWAP Calculation
Agent based on the Primary Exchange for that Index Component.

To the extent the Reference Distribution Amount on any Coupon Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the
corresponding Coupon Valuation Date, there will be no coupon payment made on the corresponding Coupon Payment Date, and an
amount equal to the difference between the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Reference Distribution Amount (the “Tracking Fee
Shortfall”) will be included in the Accrued Tracking Fee for the next Coupon Valuation Date.  This will be in addition to the accrual at a
rate of 0.85% per annum over the quarter that has elapsed since the previous date of determination.  This process will be repeated
to the extent necessary until the Reference Distribution Amount for a Coupon Valuation Date is greater than the Accrued Tracking Fee
for the corresponding Coupon Valuation Date (which includes the accumulated Tracking Fee Shortfall from all prior quarters).  This
process may also restart as necessary on a subsequent Coupon Valuation Date.  Coupon payments on the Alerian ETNs will be payable
quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth Index Business Day following each Coupon Valuation Date, provided that the final Coupon
Payment Date will be the Maturity Date.  The final Coupon Amount will be included in the Cash Settlement Amount.

Holders will receive no coupon payment on a Coupon Payment Date if the Reference Distribution Amount on the relevant Coupon
Valuation Date is less than the Accrued Tracking Fee on the relevant Coupon Valuation Date.

On each Index Business Day, the Note Calculation Agent will calculate the value of the Coupon Amount as of the immediately
preceding Index Business Day (treating that immediately preceding Index Business Day as if it were a Coupon Valuation Date), which
we refer to as the interim accrued Coupon Amount, and will publish the interim accrued Coupon Amount on Bloomberg under the
ticker symbol “AMJEU” and on Bloomberg.com under the ticker symbol “AMJEU:IND.” While the interim accrued Coupon Amount is
calculated and published in connection with each such Index Business Day, the actual Coupon Amount will be calculated and paid only
once each quarter.

Payment Upon Early Repurchase

Subject to a holder's compliance with the procedures and the potential postponements and adjustments as described under “Market
Disruption Events” below, that holder may submit a request once a week (generally on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
Thursday) during the term of the Alerian ETNs to have us repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, provided that holder requests that
we repurchase a minimum of 50,000 Alerian ETNs.  If a holder requests that we repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs, subject to the
notification requirements and the other terms and conditions set forth under “Repurchase Requirements” below, for each Alerian
ETN that holder will receive a cash payment on the relevant Repurchase Date equal to the Repurchase Amount.  If the Repurchase
Amount is $0 or less, the payment upon early repurchase will be $0.  Because the Repurchase Amount is based on the value of the
Index at the end of a five-day measurement period that begins after a repurchase request is received, holders will not know the
Repurchase Amount they will receive at the time they elect to request that we repurchase their Alerian ETNs.

The Repurchase Amount is calculated by adjusting the Principal Amount to reflect:

•
•
•
•

the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;
the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee;
the deduction of the Repurchase Fee;
the addition of other adjustments representing accrued but unpaid coupons, which include the following:

•

•

•

the Coupon Amount with respect to the Coupon Valuation Date immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase
Valuation Date (generally the last Index Business Day of the week in which a repurchase is requested) if, on the last
Index Business Day in the Repurchase Measurement Period the Coupon Ex-Date with respect to that Coupon
Amount has not yet occurred. The Repurchase Measurement Period is a five-Index Business Day period commencing
on the Repurchase Valuation Date during which the Final VWAP Level will be determined;
an Adjusted Coupon Amount, if any, that reflects certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-
dividend dates from and excluding the immediately preceding Coupon Valuation Date to and including the
applicable Repurchase Valuation Date, less the Accrued Tracking Fee; and
certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase Measurement
Period.

For purposes of determining the Cash Settlement Amount, the Final VWAP Level will be the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels
measured on each Index Business Day in the Repurchase Measurement Period, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.

The Repurchase Fee Amount is equal to 0.125% of the Principal Amount, adjusted to reflect:

•
•
•

the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;
the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee; and
the addition of certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase
Measurement Period.

Accordingly, the Repurchase Fee Amount will vary based on the performance of the Index, the Accrued Tracking Fee and certain cash
distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Repurchase Measurement Period.

Holders may lose some or all of their investment upon early repurchase.  Because the Accrued Tracking Fee reduces their final
payment, holders will likely lose some or all of their principal amount upon early repurchase if the Final VWAP Level is less than the
Initial VWAP Level or if the Final VWAP Level is not greater than the Initial VWAP Level by an amount that is sufficient to offset the
negative effect of the Accrued Tracking Fee and the Repurchase Fee.

Repurchase Requirements

To exercise the right to have us repurchase a holder's Alerian ETNs on a weekly basis, that holder must instruct that holder's broker
or other person through whom that holder holds the Alerian ETNs to take the following steps:

•

Send a notice of repurchase, substantially in the specified form (a “Repurchase Notice”), to us via email at
ETN_Repurchase@jpmorgan.com by no later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, during the term of the Alerian ETNs, each
week on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Valuation Date (generally Thursday);

•

•

•

•

If we receive that holder's Repurchase Notice by the time specified in the preceding bullet point, we will respond by sending
that holder a confirmation of repurchase, substantially in the specified form (a “Repurchase Confirmation”);
Deliver the signed Repurchase Confirmation, in the specified form, to us via facsimile to (917) 456-3471, by 4:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Business Day on which that holder submitted that holder's Repurchase Notice.  We or our affiliate must
acknowledge receipt in order for that holder's Repurchase Confirmation to be effective;
Instruct DTC custodian for that holder to book a delivery versus payment trade with respect to that holder's Alerian ETNs on
the relevant Repurchase Valuation Date at a price equal to the applicable Repurchase Amount; and
Cause that holder's DTC custodian to deliver the trade as booked for settlement via DTC at or prior to 10:00 a.m. New York
City time on the relevant Repurchase Date.

Different brokerage firms may have different deadlines for accepting instructions from their customers.  Accordingly, holders should
consult the brokerage firm through which they own their interest in the offered Alerian ETNs in respect of such deadlines.  If we do
not receive a holder's Repurchase Notice by 11:00 a.m., or a holder's Repurchase Confirmation by 4:00 p.m., on the Business Day
immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase Valuation Date, that holder's Repurchase Notice will not be effective and we will
not repurchase that holder's Alerian ETNs on the relevant Repurchase Date.

The Note Calculation Agent will, in its sole discretion, resolve any questions that may arise as to the validity of a Repurchase Notice
and the timing of receipt of a Repurchase Notice or as to whether and when the required deliveries have been made.  Once given, a
Repurchase Notice may not be revoked.

Expiration of Repurchase Rights

If we do not receive a holder's Repurchase Notice by 11:00 a.m., New York City time (as described under the first bullet point in
“Repurchase Requirements” above), or a holder's Repurchase Confirmation by 4:00 p.m., New York City time (as described under the
third bullet point in “Repurchase Requirements” above) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Repurchase
Valuation Date (generally Thursday), that holder's Repurchase Notice will not be effective and we will not repurchase that holder's
Alerian ETNs on the relevant Repurchase Date.  Any Repurchase Notice for which we (or our affiliate) receive a valid Repurchase
Confirmation in accordance with the procedures described above will be irrevocable.

Payment at Maturity

For each Alerian ETN, unless earlier repurchased, holders will receive at maturity a cash payment equal to the Cash Settlement
Amount.  If the Cash Settlement Amount is $0 or less, the payment at maturity will be $0.

The Cash Settlement Amount is calculated by adjusting the Principal Amount to reflect:

•
•
•
•

the return of the Index from the Initial VWAP Level to the Final VWAP Level;
the addition of the final Coupon Amount, if any,
the deduction of the Accrued Tracking Fee; and
the addition of certain cash distributions on the Index Components with ex-dividend dates during the Final Measurement
Period.

The Final Measurement Period is a five Index Business Day period near the Maturity Date of the Alerian ETNs during which the Final
VWAP Level will be determined.

For purposes of determining the Cash Settlement Amount, the Final VWAP Level will be the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels
measured on each Index Business Day in the Final Measurement Period, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.  The Initial
VWAP Level is the arithmetic mean of the VWAP Levels measured on each Index Business Day over a three Index Business Day period
ending on the Inception Date, as calculated by the VWAP Calculation Agent.

Holders may lose some or all of their investment at maturity.  Because the Accrued Tracking Fee reduces their final payment, holders
will likely lose some or all of their principal amount at maturity if the Final VWAP Level is less than the Initial VWAP Level or if the
Final VWAP Level is not greater than the Initial VWAP Level by an amount that is sufficient to offset the negative effects of the
Accrued Tracking Fee.

Note Calculation Agent

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, or JPMS (the “Note Calculation Agent”), will make all necessary calculations and determinations in
connection with the Alerian ETNs, including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Alerian ETNs, other
those to be made by the VWAP Calculation Agent described below.

VWAP Calculation Agent

The JPMorgan Global Index Research Group (the “VWAP Calculation Agent”), one of our affiliates, will on each day that is not a
Disrupted Day (as defined below) act as the VWAP Calculation Agent.  The VWAP Calculation Agent will determine the VWAP of any
Index Component, the VWAP Level and the Final VWAP Level on any Index Business Day on which such VWAP, VWAP Level and Final
VWAP Level are to be determined during the term of the Alerian ETNs.

Market Disruption Events

To the extent a Disrupted Day (as defined below) exists with respect to an Index Component on an Averaging Date (as defined below),
the VWAP and published share weighting with respect to such Index Component (and only with respect to such Index Component) for
such Averaging Date will be determined by the Note Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates on the first succeeding Index Business
Day that is not a Disrupted Day (the “Deferred Averaging Date”) with respect to such Index Component irrespective of whether
pursuant to such determination, the Deferred Averaging Date would fall on a date originally scheduled to be an Averaging Date.  For
the avoidance of doubt, if the postponement described in the preceding sentence results in the VWAP of a particular Index
Component being calculated on a day originally scheduled to be an Averaging Date, for purposes of determining the VWAP Levels on
the Index Business Days during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, the Note
Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates, as the case may be, will apply the VWAP and the published share weighting with respect to
such Index Component for such Deferred Averaging Date to the calculation of the VWAP Level (i) on the date(s) of the original
disruption with respect to such Index Component and (ii) such Averaging Date.

In no event, however, will any postponement pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph result in the final Averaging Date with
respect to any Index Component occurring more than three Index Business Days following the day originally scheduled to be the final
Averaging Date.  If the third Index Business Day following the date originally scheduled to be the final Averaging Date is not an Index
Business Day or is a Disrupted Day with respect to such Index Component, the Note Calculation Agent or one of its affiliates, will
determine the VWAP and share weighting with respect to any Index Component required to be determined for the purpose of
calculating the applicable VWAP Level based on its good faith estimate of the VWAP and share weighting of each such Index
Component that would have prevailed on the Primary Exchange on such third Index Business Day but for such suspension or
limitation.

An “Averaging Date” means each of the Index Business Days during the Final Measurement Period or the Repurchase Measurement
Period, as applicable, subject to adjustment as described herein.

A “Disrupted Day” with respect to any Index Component is any Index Business Day on which the Primary Exchange or any Related
Exchange fails to open for trading during its regular trading session or on which a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is
continuing, and, in both cases, the occurrence of which is determined by the Note Calculation Agent to have a material effect on the
VWAP Level.

With respect to an Index Component, a “Market Disruption Event,” means:

(a) the occurrence or existence of a condition specified below:

(i) any suspension, absence or limitation of trading on the Primary Exchange for trading in the Index Component, whether by
reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by the Primary Exchange or otherwise;

(ii) any suspension, absence or limitation of trading on the Related Exchange for trading in futures or options contracts related to
the Index Component, whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by such Related Exchange or
otherwise; or

(iii) any event (other than an event described in (b) below) that disrupts or impairs (as determined by the Note Calculation
Agent) the ability of market participants in general (A) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for the relevant Index
Component or (B) to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, futures or options contracts relating to the relevant
Index Component; or

(b) the closure on any Index Business Day of the Primary Exchange or any Related Exchange prior to its Scheduled Closing Time
unless such earlier closing time is announced by the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange at least one hour prior to the earlier
of (i) the actual closing time for the regular trading session on the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index
Business Day and (ii) the submission deadline for orders to be entered into the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange system
for execution at the close of trading on such Index Business Day;

in each case determined by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion; and

(c) a determination by the Note Calculation Agent in its sole discretion that the applicable event described above materially
interfered with our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to adjust or unwind all or a material portion of any hedge with respect
to the Alerian ETNs.

For purposes of the above definition:

(a) a limitation on the hours or number of days of trading will not constitute a Market Disruption Event if it results from an announced
change in the regular business hours of the Primary Exchange or Related Exchange, and

(b) for purposes of clause (a) above, limitations pursuant to the rules of any Primary Exchange or Related Exchange similar to NYSE
Rule 80B or Nasdaq Rule 4120 (or any applicable rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by any other self-regulatory
organization or any government agency of scope similar to NYSE Rule 80B or Nasdaq Rule 4120 as determined by the Note
Calculation Agent) on trading during significant market fluctuations will constitute a suspension, absence or material limitation of
trading.

“Scheduled Closing Time” means, with respect to the Primary Exchange or the Related Exchange, on any Index Business Day, the
scheduled weekday closing time of the Primary Exchange or such Related Exchange on such Index Business Day, without regard to
after hours or any other trading outside of the regular trading session hours.

Discontinuation of the Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation

If the Index Calculation Agent discontinues publication of or otherwise fails to publish the Index, or the Index Calculation Agent does
not make the Index Components, their share weighting and/or the Index Divisor available to the VWAP Calculation Agent, and the
Index Sponsor, the Index Calculation Agent or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Note Calculation Agent
determines to be comparable to the discontinued Index and for which the Index Components, their share weighting, and/or the Index
Divisor are available to the VWAP Calculation Agent (such index being referred to herein as a “successor index”), then the VWAP
Level for such successor index will be determined by the VWAP Calculation Agent by reference to the sum of the products of the
VWAPs of the components underlying such successor index on the Primary Exchanges and each such component's respective
weighting within the successor index (which sum will be adjusted by any index divisor used by such successor index) on the dates and
at the times as of which the VWAP Levels for such successor index are to be determined.

Upon any selection by the Note Calculation Agent of a successor Index, the Note Calculation Agent will cause written notice thereof to
be furnished to the Trustee, to us and to the holders of the Alerian ETNs.

If the Index Calculation Agent discontinues publication of the Index or does not make the Index Components, their share weightings
and/or Index Divisor available to the VWAP Calculation Agent prior to, and such discontinuation or unavailability is continuing on the
Calculation Date or any Index Business Day during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as
applicable, or any other relevant date on which the VWAP Level is to be determined and the Note Calculation Agent determines that
no successor index is available at such time, or the Note Calculation Agent has previously selected a successor index and publication
of such successor index is discontinued prior to, and such discontinuation is continuing on the Calculation Date or any Index Business
Day during the Final Measurement Period or during the Repurchase Measurement Period, as applicable, or any other relevant date on
which the VWAP Level is to be determined, then the Note Calculation Agent will determine the relevant VWAP Levels using the VWAP
and published share weighting of each Index Component included in the Index or successor index, as applicable, immediately prior to
such discontinuation or unavailability, as adjusted for certain corporate actions.  In such event, the Note Calculation Agent will cause
notice thereof to be furnished to the Trustee, to us and to the holders of the Alerian ETNs.

Notwithstanding these alternative arrangements, discontinuation of the publication of the Index or successor index, as applicable,
may adversely affect the value of the Alerian ETNs.

If at any time the method of calculating the Index or a successor index, or the value thereof, is changed in a material respect, or if the
Index or a successor index is in any other way modified so that the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index does not, in the
opinion of the Note Calculation Agent, fairly represent the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index had such changes or
modifications not been made, then the Note Calculation Agent will make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith
judgment of the Note Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a VWAP level of an index comparable to the Index or
such successor index, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and the Note Calculation Agent will
calculate the VWAP Levels for the Index or such successor index with reference to the Index or such successor index, as adjusted.  The
Note Calculation Agent will accordingly calculate any values that reference the VWAP Levels based on the relevant VWAP Levels
calculated by the Note Calculation Agent, as adjusted.  Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index or a successor index is
modified so that the level of the Index or such successor index is a fraction of what it would have been if there had been no such
modification (e.g., due to a split in the index), which, in turn, causes the VWAP Level of the Index or such successor index to be a
fraction of what it would have been if there had been no such modification, then the Note Calculation Agent will make such

calculations and adjustments in order to arrive at a VWAP Level for the Index or such successor index as if it had not been modified
(e.g., as if such split had not occurred).

Payment upon an Event of Default

In case an event of default with respect to the Alerian ETNs shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and
payable per Alerian ETN upon any acceleration of the Alerian ETNs will be determined by the Note Calculation Agent and will be an
amount in cash equal to the Repurchase Amount, calculated as if the date of acceleration were the first Index Business Day in the
Repurchase Measurement Period and the four Index Business Days immediately succeeding the date of acceleration were the
corresponding Index Business Days in the accelerated Repurchase Measurement Period.  For purposes of this calculation the
Repurchase Fee Amount shall be zero.

If the maturity of the Alerian ETNs is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, we will, or will cause the Note
Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee may conclusively rely,
and to DTC, as holder of the Alerian ETNs, of the cash amount due with respect to the Alerian ETNs as promptly as possible and in no
event later than two Business Days after the date of acceleration.

Listing

The Alerian ETNs have been listed on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol “AMJ.”  No assurance can be given as to the continued
listing of the Alerian ETNs for their term or of the liquidity or trading market for the Alerian ETNs.

Book-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company

DTC will act as securities depositary for the Alerian ETNs.  The Alerian ETNs have been issued only as fully registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's nominee).  One or more fully registered global note certificates, representing the total
aggregate principal amount of the Alerian ETNs, have been issued and have been deposited with DTC.  We will not issue definitive
notes in exchange for the global notes except in limited circumstances.

Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent

The Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Alerian ETNs.  The Bank of New
York Mellon will also act as paying agent and may designate additional paying agents.

Reissuances or Reopening Issuances

We may in our sole discretion, “reopen” or reissue the Alerian ETNs based upon market conditions and VWAP Levels at that time.
These further issuances, if any, will be consolidated to form a single sub-series with the originally issued Alerian ETNs and will have
the same CUSIP number and will trade interchangeably with the Alerian ETNs immediately upon settlement.  Any Alerian ETNs
bearing the same CUSIP number that are issued pursuant to any future additional issuances of Alerian ETNs bearing the same CUSIP
number will increase the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Alerian ETNs.  The price of any additional offering will be
determined at the time of pricing of that offering.

General Terms of the Series E Notes

In this “General Terms of the Series E Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series E Notes issued by
JPMorgan Chase.

The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities,
including the Alerian ETNs.

We have summarized below the material provisions of the 2001 Indenture and the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture.
These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2001 Indenture, which describes completely the terms
and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued under it.  Where
appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2001 Indenture.  Any reference to particular sections or
defined terms of the 2001 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by
reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.

The debt securities will be our direct, unsecured general obligations and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of our other
unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries.  As a result, claims of the holders of
the debt securities will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries, except to the extent that JPMorgan
Chase & Co. may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those subsidiaries.  Claims of our subsidiaries' creditors other
than JPMorgan Chase & Co. include substantial amounts of long-term debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities
loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.

Events of Default and Waivers

An “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture is defined in the 2001 Indenture as:

•

•

•

•

•

default for 30 days in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series;

default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity,
upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;

failure by us for 90 days to perform any other covenants or warranties contained in the 2001 Indenture applicable to that
series after written notice has been given by the trustee to us or given by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to us and the trustee;

specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or involuntary; or

any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2001 Indenture or form of security.
(Section 5.01)

If a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable on the debt securities, or a failure in the performance of
any covenant or agreement, or any other Event of Default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2001 Indenture
or form of security, with respect to one or more (but in the case of a default in performance of a covenant or agreement, or in a
manner provided in a supplemental indenture or form of security, less than all) series of debt securities occurs and is continuing,
either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then
outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any
interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately.  If a default in the performance of any covenant or agreement with
respect to  all series of debt securities, or in a manner provided in a supplemental indenture or form of security with respect to all
series of debt securities, or due to specified events of our bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is continuing,
either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all debt securities then outstanding, treated
as one class, by written notice, may declare the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued thereon, to be
due and payable immediately.  Subject to certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by
the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and
5.10)

An Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to
any other series of debt securities.  The 2001 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt
securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt
securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Trustees and/or
responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the
applicable series to do so.  The Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other
amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11)

The 2001 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each
series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The Trustee may decline to act if the
direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2001 Indenture. (Section 5.09)  The Trustee is not
obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2001 Indenture at the request or direction of the holders of debt securities
unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein
or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))

No holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously
given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request upon the Trustee to institute such
action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) have not given direction to the Trustee that is
inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06)

However, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security
or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected
without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07)

The 2001 Indenture requires us to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to whether or not we have knowledge of a
default. (Section 3.05)

Covenant Breach

Under the 2001 Indenture, a “Covenant Breach” would occur with respect to a series of debt securities if we fail to perform or breach
any of the covenants contained in the 2001 Indenture (other than a failure to pay principal or interest on the debt securities) and
that failure or breach continues for 90 days after the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding debt securities give written notice of that failure or breach.  Neither the Trustee nor the holders of the debt securities will
be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the debt securities as a result of any Covenant Breach.

If a Covenant Breach or Event of Default with respect to the debt securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the holders of the debt securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings
as the Trustee deems most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement in the 2001 Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the 2001 Indenture, or to enforce any other
proper remedy.

Modification of the 2001 Indenture

The 2001 Indenture contains provisions permitting us and the Trustee to modify the 2001 Indenture or the rights of the holders of
debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of each outstanding series of
debt securities affected by the modification.  Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a modification that would:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt security;

reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;

change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2001 Indenture applicable
to debt securities in foreign currencies;

change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any debt
security;

reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;

adversely affect the terms on which debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable or payable in other securities,
instruments, contracts, currencies, commodities or other forms of property;

impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any right of
repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security; or

reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any modification.
(Section 8.02)

The 2001 Indenture also permits us and the Trustee to amend the 2001 Indenture in certain circumstances without the consent of
the holders of debt securities to evidence our merger or the replacement of the Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or
supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, to make any change to the 2001 Indenture or our debt securities that we deem
necessary or desirable and that does not materially and adversely affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain
other purposes. (Section 8.01)

Consolidations, Mergers and Sales of Assets

We may not merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to any other
entity (other than the sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to one or more of our direct or indirect
subsidiaries), unless:

•

either we are the continuing corporation or the successor entity or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or
transferred is a United States corporation or limited liability company that expressly assumes the due and punctual payment
of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture and
the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2001 Indenture binding upon
us, and

•

we or the successor entity will not, immediately after the merger or consolidation, sale, conveyance or transfer, be in default
in the performance of any covenant or condition of the 2001 Indenture binding on us. (Section 9.01)

There are no covenants or other provisions in the 2001 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in
the event of a recapitalization transaction, a change of control of JPMorgan Chase & Co. or a highly leveraged transaction.  The
merger covenant described above would apply only if the recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged
transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of JPMorgan Chase & Co. or a sale or conveyance of all or
substantially all of our assets.  However, we may provide specific protections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular
debt securities, which we would describe in the applicable prospectus supplement.

Concerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent

Our subsidiaries and we have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, The Bank of New
York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Bank of New York Mellon and, for notes settled through Euroclear
Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will be the paying agents,
registrars, authenticating agents and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the trustee for other securities issued by us or JPMorgan Financial,
including the debt securities issued under the 2001 Indenture, the debt securities issued under JPMorgan Financial's indenture for
debt securities, to which we are a guarantor, and the warrants issued under JPMorgan Financial's warrant indenture, to which we are
a guarantor.  Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default occurs with respect to any of these securities, the Trustee may
be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  In that case, the Trustee
may be required to resign under the 2001 Indenture, and we would be required to appoint a successor trustee.  For this purpose, a
“potential” event of default means an event that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving us default notice or for
the default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded.

Governing Law and Judgments

The debt securities and the 2001 Indenture will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
(Section 11.08)

DESCRIPTION OF JPMORGAN CHASE FINANCIAL COMPANY LLC’S CALLABLE FIXED RATE NOTES DUE JUNE 10, 2032, FULLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

The following description of the Callable Fixed Rate Notes due June 10, 2032 (the “Callable Notes”) is a summary and does not
purport to be complete.  It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture dated February 19, 2016 (as may
be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “2016 Indenture”), among JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, as issuer
(“JPMorgan Financial” or the “Issuer”), JPMorgan Chase, as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas, as trustee (the “Trustee”), which is incorporated by reference as an Exhibit to the Form 10-K.  We encourage you to read
the 2016 Indenture for additional information.

General

As of December 31, 2021, $5,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes were outstanding.

The Callable Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Financial, the payment of which is fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Callable Notes will rank pari passu with all of the Issuer’s other unsecured
and unsubordinated obligations.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s guarantee of the Callable Notes will rank pari passu with all of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  Any payment on the Callable Notes issued by JPMorgan Financial is
subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Finance Callable Notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as guarantor of the
Callable Notes.

The Callable Notes are part of a series of the Issuer’s debt securities entitled “Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A” (the “Series A
Notes”) that the Issuer may issue under the 2016 Indenture from time to time.  For more information about the Series A Notes,
please see the section titled “— General Terms of the Series A Notes” below.

The Callable Notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other
governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

Unless otherwise specified, references herein to “holders” mean those in whose names the Callable Notes are registered on the books
that the Issuer or the Trustee, or any successor trustee, as applicable, maintain for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial
interests in the Callable Notes (registered in street name or otherwise).

Key Terms of the Callable Notes

We issued the Callable Notes on June 10, 2021, in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 thereafter.
The Maturity Date of the Callable Notes is June 10, 2032.  Interest on the Callable Notes is payable semiannually on June 10th and
December 10th of each year, beginning on December 10, 2021 to and including the Maturity Date (each, an “Interest Payment
Date”), subject to any earlier redemption, at the Interest Rate of 2.60% per annum.

On June 10, 2031 (the “Redemption Date”), the Issuer may redeem the holders’ Callable Notes, in whole but not in part, at a price
equal to the principal amount being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest.  Any accrued and unpaid interest on the Callable
Notes redeemed will be paid to the person who is the holder of record on such Callable Notes at the close of business one (1)
business day prior to the Redemption Date.  To redeem the Callable Notes, the Issuer will deliver notice to DTC, as holder of the
Callable Notes, at least 5 business days and not more than 15 business days prior to the Redemption Date.

Calculation Agent

JPMS (the “Calculation Agent”) will make all necessary calculations and determinations in connection with the Callable Notes,
including calculations and determinations relating to any payments on the Callable Notes.

Payment upon an Event of Default

In case an event of default with respect to the Callable Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and
payable per $1,000 principal amount note upon any acceleration of the Callable Notes will be determined by the Calculation Agent
and will be an amount in cash equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount note plus accrued and unpaid interest, calculated as if
the date of acceleration were the Maturity Date.  In such case, interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the
actual number of days in such adjusted Interest Period and will be based on the Interest Rate on the applicable date immediately
preceding such adjusted Interest Period.

If the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated because of an event of default as described above, the Issuer will, or will cause the
Calculation Agent to, provide written notice to the Trustee at its New York office, on which notice the Trustee may conclusively rely,
and to DTC of the cash amount due with respect to the Callable Notes as promptly as possible and in no event later than two business
days after the date of acceleration.

Listing

The Callable Notes are listed and admitted to trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol “JPM/32.” No assurance can be given as
to the continued listing for the term of the Callable Notes, or the liquidity or trading market for the Callable Notes.

Book-Entry Only Issuance — The Depository Trust Company

DTC will act as securities depositary for the Callable Notes.  The Callable Notes have been issued only as fully registered securities
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s nominee).  One or more fully registered global note certificates, representing the total
aggregate principal amount of the Callable Notes, have been issued and have been deposited with DTC.  We will not issue definitive
notes in exchange for the global notes except in limited circumstances.

Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent

The Bank of New York Mellon or one of its affiliates will act as registrar and transfer agent for the Callable Notes.  The Bank of New
York Mellon will also act as paying agent for the Callable Notes and may designate additional paying agents.

Reopening Issuances

The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, “reopen” the Callable Notes based upon market conditions at that time.  These further
issuances, if any, will be consolidated with, have the same CUSIP number as and trade interchangeably with the respective originally
issued Callable Notes immediately upon settlement and, consequently, will increase the aggregate principal amount of such
outstanding Callable Notes.  The price of any additional offering will be determined at the time of pricing of that offering.

General Terms of the Series A Notes

In this “General Terms of the Series A Notes” section, all references to the “debt securities” refer to Series A Notes issued by
JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC.

The following description of the terms of the debt securities contains certain general terms that may apply to the debt securities,
including the Callable Notes.

We have summarized below the material provisions of the 2016 Indenture and the debt securities and guarantees issued under the
2016 Indenture.

These descriptions are only summaries, and each investor should refer to the 2016 Indenture, which describes completely the terms
and definitions summarized below and contains additional information regarding the debt securities issued under it.  Where

appropriate, we use parentheses to refer you to the particular sections of the 2016 Indenture.  Any reference to particular sections or
defined terms of the 2016 Indenture in any statement under this heading qualifies the entire statement and incorporates by
reference the applicable section or definition into that statement.

The debt securities will be the Issuer’s direct, unsecured general obligations, the payment on which is fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by the Guarantor, and will have the same rank in liquidation as all of the Issuer’s other unsecured and unsubordinated
debt.

The Guarantor is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries.  As a result, claims of the
holders of the debt securities against the Guarantor under the guarantee will generally have a junior position to claims of creditors of
the Guarantor’s subsidiaries, except to the extent that the Guarantor may be recognized, and receives payment, as a creditor of those
subsidiaries.  Claims of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries’ creditors other than the Guarantor include substantial amounts of long-term
debt, deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and
other borrowed funds.

Events of Default and Waivers

An “Event of Default” with respect to a series of debt securities issued under the 2016 Indenture is defined in the 2016 Indenture as:

•

•

•

•

•

•

default in the payment of interest on any debt securities of that series and continuance of such default for 30 days;

default in the payment of principal or other amounts payable on any debt securities of that series when due, at maturity,
upon redemption, by declaration, or otherwise;

default in the performance, or breach, of any other covenants or warranties applicable to the Issuer contained in the 2016
Indenture applicable to that series, and continuation of such default or breach for 90 days after written notice has been
given by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Guarantor or given by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding securities of all series affected thereby to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee;

certain events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, whether voluntary or
involuntary;

the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the 2016 Indenture, or the Guarantor
denies or disaffirms its obligations under the guarantee, provided that no Event of Default with respect to the guarantee will
occur as a result of, or because it is related directly or indirectly to, the insolvency of the Guarantor or the commencement of
proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code, or the appointment of a receiver for the Guarantor under Title II of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having
separately repudiated the Guarantee in receivership, or the commencement of or certain other events of the Guarantor’s
bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation; or

any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016 Indenture or form of security.
(Section 5.01)

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing because of a default in the payment of principal, interest or other amounts payable on
the debt securities, a failure in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement applicable to the Issuer, the guarantee
ceasing to be in full force and effect, or any other event of default provided in the applicable supplemental indentures to the 2016
Indenture or form of security, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt
securities of such series then outstanding, treated as one class, by written notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor, may declare the
principal of all outstanding debt securities of such series and any interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately.  If a
default due to specified events of the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation, occurs and is
continuing, the principal of all outstanding debt securities and any interest accrued thereon will automatically, and without any
declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable.  Subject to certain
conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding debt securities of the series affected. (Sections 5.01 and 5.10)

Events of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution, receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor will not constitute an
Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.  In addition, failure by the Guarantor to perform any of its covenants or
warranties (other than a payment default) will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities.
Therefore, events of bankruptcy, resolution, receivership, insolvency, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor (in the
absence of any such event occurring with respect to the Issuer) will not permit any of the debt securities to be declared due and
payable and the Trustee is not authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the Guarantor upon the occurrence or
continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.  Instead, even if an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution,
receivership, winding up or liquidation relating to the Guarantor has occurred, the Trustee and the holders of debt securities of a
series will not be able to declare the relevant debt securities to be immediately due and payable unless there is an Event of Default
with respect to that series as described above, such as the Issuer’s bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up or liquidation or

a payment default by the Issuer or the Guarantor on the relevant debt securities.  The value holders receive on any series of debt
securities may be significantly less than what holders would have otherwise received had the Issuer’s debt securities been
declared due and payable immediately or the Trustee been authorized to exercise any remedy against the Issuer or the
Guarantor upon the occurrence or continuation of these events with respect to the Guarantor.

An Event of Default with respect to one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default with respect to
any other series of debt securities.  The 2016 Indenture requires the Trustee to provide notice of default with respect to the debt
securities within 90 days, unless the default is cured, but provides that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the debt
securities of any default if the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Trustees and/or
responsible officers of the Trustee determines in good faith that it is in the interest of the holders of the debt securities of the
applicable series to do so.  The Trustee may not withhold notice of a default in the payment of principal of, interest on or any other
amounts due under, such debt securities. (Section 5.11)

The 2016 Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of each
series affected, with all such series voting as a single class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.  The Trustee may decline to act if the
direction is contrary to law and in certain other circumstances set forth in the 2016 Indenture. (Section 5.09)  The Trustee is not
obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the 2016 Indenture at the request or direction of the holders of debt securities
unless the holders offer the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities incurred therein
or thereby. (Section 6.02(d))

No holder of any debt security of any affected series has the right to institute any action for remedy unless such holder has previously
given to the Trustee written notice of default, the Trustee has failed to take action for 60 days after the holders of not less than 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each affected series make written request upon the Trustee to institute such
action and have offered reasonable indemnity in connection with the same and the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the debt securities of each affected series (voting as a single class) have not given direction to the Trustee that is
inconsistent with the written request referred to above. (Section 5.06)

However, the right of any holder of a debt security or coupon to receive payment of the principal of and interest on that debt security
or coupon on or after its due date, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, may not be impaired or affected
without the consent of that holder. (Section 5.07)

The 2016 Indenture requires the Issuer and the Guarantor to file annually with the Trustee a written statement as to whether or not
the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, has knowledge of a default. (Section 3.05)

Modification of the 2016 Indenture

The 2016 Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to modify the 2016 Indenture or the
rights of the holders of debt securities with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of
each outstanding series of debt securities affected by the modification.  Each holder of an affected debt security must consent to a
modification that would:

•
•
•

•

•
•

•

extend the final maturity date of the principal of, or of any interest on, or other amounts payable under any debt security;
reduce the principal amount of, rate of interest on, or any other amounts due under any debt security;
change the currency or currency unit of payment of any debt security or certain provisions of the 2016 Indenture applicable
to debt securities in foreign currencies;
change the method in which amounts of payments of principal, interest or other amounts are determined on any debt
security;
reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any debt security;
impair the right of a holder to institute suit for the payment of a debt security or, if the debt securities provide, any right of
repurchase at the option of the holder of a debt security;
reduce the percentage of debt securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any modification;
or

• make any change in the guarantee that would adversely affect the holders of the debt securities of such series or release the

Guarantor from the guarantee other than pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Indenture. (Section 8.02)

The 2016 Indenture also permits the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee to amend the 2016 Indenture in certain circumstances
without the consent of the holders of debt securities to evidence the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s merger or the replacement of the
Trustee, to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision, to make any change to the 2016
Indenture or the Issuer’s debt securities that the Issuer deems necessary or desirable and that does not materially and adversely
affect the interests of holders of the debt securities and for certain other purposes. (Section 8.01)

Consolidations, Mergers, Sales and Transfers of Assets

Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor may merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell, convey or transfer all or substantially all
of their respective assets to any other entity, unless:

•

with respect to the Issuer:

•

•

either the Issuer is the continuing company in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor entity in the case
of a merger or consolidation (including an affiliate of the Guarantor) or the entity to whom those assets are sold,
conveyed or transferred in the case of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation or limited liability
company that expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other
amounts due under the debt securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and
conditions of the 2016 Indenture binding upon the Issuer, and
no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has
occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer,
and

•

with respect to the Guarantor:

•

•

either the Guarantor is the continuing corporation in the case of a merger or consolidation or the successor corporation
in the case of a merger or consolidation or the entity to whom those assets are sold, conveyed or transferred in the case
of a sale, conveyance or transfer is a United States corporation that expressly assumes the full and unconditional
guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the principal of, any interest on, or any other amounts due under the debt
securities and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the 2016
Indenture binding upon the Guarantor, and
no Event of Default and no event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default has
occurred or would be continuing, immediately after the merger or consolidation, or the sale, conveyance or transfer.
(Sections 9.01 and 9.02)

Any transfer of material assets of the Guarantor to any other entity that occurs as a result of, or because it is related directly or
indirectly to, any proceedings relative to the Guarantor under Title 11 of the United States Code or under a receivership under Title II
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or under any other applicable federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or other similar law will be deemed to be a sale, conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of
the Guarantor’s assets.

There are no covenants or other provisions in the 2016 Indenture that would afford holders of debt securities additional protection in
the event of a recapitalization transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor, a change of control of the Issuer or the Guarantor or
a highly leveraged transaction involving the Issuer or the Guarantor.  The merger covenant described above would apply only if the
recapitalization transaction, change of control or highly leveraged transaction were structured to include a merger or consolidation of
the Issuer or the Guarantor or a sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s assets.  However, the
Issuer may provide specific protections, such as a put right or increased interest, for particular debt securities, which the Issuer would
describe in the applicable prospectus supplement.

JPMorgan Chase Guarantee

The Guarantor will fully and unconditionally guarantee the full and punctual payment of the principal of, interest on, and all other
amounts payable under the debt securities when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity, upon redemption,
repurchase at the option of the holders of the applicable debt securities or upon acceleration.  If for any reason the Issuer does not
make any required payment in respect of the Issuer’s debt securities when due, the Guarantor will on demand pay the unpaid amount
at the same place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by the Issuer under the 2016 Indenture.  The guarantee is
of payment and not of collection. (Section 14.01)

The Guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee are unconditional and absolute. However, (1) the Guarantor will not be liable for
any amount of payment that the Issuer is excused from making or any amount in excess of the amount actually due and owing by the
Issuer, and (2) any defense or counterclaims available to the Issuer (except those resulting solely from, or on account of, the Issuer’s
insolvency or the Issuer’s status as debtor or subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) will also be available to the Guarantor
to the same extent as these defense or counterclaims are available to the Issuer, whether or not asserted by the Issuer. (Section
14.02)

Concerning the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent

We, the Guarantor and certain of their affiliates have a wide range of banking relationships with Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas, The Bank of New York Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.  The Bank of New York Mellon and, for
notes settled through Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A., Luxembourg, The Bank of New York Mellon, London

Branch, will be the paying agents, authenticating agents, registrars and transfer agents for debt securities issued under the 2016
Indenture.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is initially serving as the Trustee for the debt securities issued under our 2016 Indenture, to
which JPMorgan Chase acts as a guarantor, the warrants issued under our warrant indenture, to which JPMorgan Chase acts as a
guarantor, and the debt securities issued under JPMorgan Chase’s indenture.  Consequently, if an actual or potential event of default
occurs with respect to any of these securities, the Trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest for purposes of the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  In that case, the Trustee may be required to resign under the 2016 Indenture, and the Issuer
would be required to appoint a successor trustee.  For this purpose, a “potential” event of default means an event that would be an
event of default if the requirements for giving the Issuer default notice or for the default having to exist for a specific period of time
were disregarded.

Governing Law and Judgments

The debt securities and the 2016 Indenture, including the guarantee, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York. (Section 11.08)

Capitalized	terms	that	are	not	defined	in	“Definitions”	below	or	elsewhere	in	the	Award	Agreement	will	have	the	same	meaning	as	set	forth	in	the
Plan.

JPMorgan	Chase	&	Co.	will	be	referred	to	throughout	the	Award	Agreement	as	“JPMorgan	Chase”	and	together	with	its	subsidiaries	as	the	“Firm”.

Form and Purpose of Award
Each	RSU	represents	a	non-transferable	right	to	receive	one	share	of	Common	Stock	as	of	the	applicable	vesting	date	as	set	forth	in	your	Award
Agreement.

The	purpose	of	this	award	is	to	motivate	your	future	performance	for	services	to	be	provided	during	the	vesting	period	and	to	align	your	interests
with	those	of	the	Firm	and	its	shareholders.

Dividend Equivalents
If	dividends	are	paid	on	Common	Stock	while	RSUs	under	this	award	are	outstanding,	you	will	be	paid	an	amount	equal	to	the	dividend	paid	on	one
share	of	Common	Stock,	multiplied	by	the	number	of	RSUs	outstanding	under	this	award	as	of	the	dividend	record	date.

Protection-Based Vesting
This	award	is	intended	and	expected	to	vest	on	the	vesting	date(s),	provided	that	you	are	continuously	employed	by	the	Firm	through	such	vesting
date,	 or	 you	 meet	 the	 requirements	 for	 continued	 vesting	 described	 under	 the	 subsections	 “--Job	 Elimination”,	 “--Full	 Career	 Eligibility”,	 “--
Government	 Office”	 or	 “--Disability”.	 	 However,	 vesting	 and	 the	 number	 of	 RSUs	 in	 which	 you	 vest	 are	 subject	 to	 these	 terms	 and	 conditions
(including,	but	not	limited	to,	sections	captioned	“Recapture	Provisions”,	“Remedies”	and	the	following	protection-based	vesting	provision).

Up	 to	 a	 total	 of	 fifty	 percent	 of	 your	 award	 that	 would	 otherwise	 be	 distributable	 to	 you	 during	 the	 vesting	 period	 (“At	 Risk	 RSUs”)	 may	 be
cancelled	if	the	Chief	Executive	Officer	of	JPMorgan	Chase	(“CEO”)	determines	in	his	or	her	sole	discretion	that	cancellation	of	all	or	portion	of	the
At	Risk	RSUs	is	appropriate	in	light	of	any	one	or	a	combination	of	the	following	factors:

•

•

•

•

Your	performance	in	relation	to	the	priorities	for	your	position,	or	the	Firm’s	performance	in	relation	to	the	priorities	for	which	you	share
responsibility	as	a	member	of	the	Operating	Committee,	have	been	unsatisfactory	for	a	sustained	period	of	time.		Among	the	factors	the
CEO	may	consider	in	assessing	performance	are	net	income,	total	net	revenue,	return	on	equity,	earnings	per	share	and	capital	ratios	of
the	Firm,	both	on	an	absolute	basis	and,	as	appropriate,	relative	to	peer	firms.
For	 any	 calendar	 year	 ending	 during	 the	 vesting	 period,	 JPMorgan	 Chase’s	 annual	 pre-tax	 pre-provision	 income	 at	 the	 Firm	 level	 is
negative.
Awards	 granted	 to	 participants	 in	 a	 Line	 of	 Business	 for	 which	 you	 exercise,	 or	 during	 the	 vesting	 period	 exercised,	 direct	 or	 indirect
responsibility,	 were	 in	 whole	 or	 in	 part	 cancelled	 because	 the	 Line	 of	 Business	 did	 not	 meet	 its	 annual	 Line	 of	 Business	 Financial
Threshold.
The	Firm	does	not	meet	the	Firmwide	Financial	Threshold.

In	 the	 event	 that	 your	 employment	 terminates	 due	 to	 “Job	 Elimination”,	 ”Full	 Career	 Eligibility”,	 Government	 Office”	 or	 “Disability”	 thereby
entitling	 you	 to	 continued	 vesting	 in	 your	 award	 (or	 potentially	 acceleration	 due	 to	 satisfaction	 of	 the	 Government	 Office	 Requirements),	 the
cancellation	 circumstances	 described	 above	 will	 continue	 to	 apply	 to	 your	 At	 Risk	 RSUs	 pursuant	 to	 the	 subsection	 captioned	 “Accelerated
Distribution	for	Ethics	or	Conflict	Reasons	Resulting	From	Employment	by	a	Government	Entity”.

Any	 determination	 above	 with	 respect	 to	 protection-based	 vesting	 provisions	 is	 subject	 to	 ratification	 by	 the	 Compensation	 and	 Management
Development	Committee	of	the	Board	of	Directors	of	JPMorgan	Chase	(“Committee”).		In	the	case	of	an	award	to	the	CEO,	all	such	determinations
shall	be	made	by	the	Committee	and	ratified	by	the	Board.

Vesting Period
The	period	from	the	Grant	Date	to	the	last	vesting	date	is	the	“vesting	period”	(see	subsections	captioned	“--Amendment”	pursuant	to	which	the
Firm	may	extend	the	vesting	period	and	“--No	Ownership	Rights/Other	Limitations”	pursuant	to	which	the	Firm	may	place	restrictions	on	delivered
shares	of	Common	Stock	following	a	vesting	date).

Bonus Recoupment
In	consideration	of	the	grant	of	this	award,	you	agree	that	you	are	subject	to	the	JPMorgan	Chase	Bonus	Recoupment	Policy	(or	successor	policy)	as

https://about.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/corporate-governance-principles

For	 the	 avoidance	 of	 doubt,	 nothing	 in	 these	 terms	 and	 conditions	 in	 any	 way	 limits	 the	 rights	 of	 the	 Firm	 under	 the	 JPMorgan	 Chase	 Bonus
Recoupment	Policy	(or	successor	policy).

Recapture Provisions (Detrimental Conduct, Risk-Related and Other Recapture Provisions)
Notwithstanding	any	terms	of	this	Award	Agreement	to	the	contrary,	JPMorgan	Chase	reserves	the	right	in	its	sole	discretion	to	cancel	up	to	100%
of	your	outstanding	RSUs	under	this	award	and,	to	the	extent	set	forth	in	“Remedies”	below,	to	recover	from	you	up	to	an	amount	equal	to	the	Fair
Market	 Value	 (determined	 as	 of	 the	 applicable	 vesting	 date)	 of	 the	 gross	 number	 of	 shares	 of	 Common	 Stock	 previously	 distributed	 (including
shares	withheld	for	tax	purposes)	under	this	award	if	the	Firm	in	its	sole	discretion	determines	that:

•

•
•

•

you	engaged	in	conduct	detrimental	to	the	Firm	insofar	as	it	causes	material	financial	or	reputational	harm	to	the	Firm	or	its	business
activities,	or
this	award	was	based	on	materially	inaccurate	performance	metrics,	whether	or	not	you	were	responsible	for	the	inaccuracy,	or
this	award	was	based	on	a	material	misrepresentation	by	you,	or
you	improperly	or	with	gross	negligence	failed	to	identify,	raise	or	assess,	in	a	timely	manner	and	as	reasonably	expected,	risks	and/or
concerns	with	respect	to	risks	material	to	the	Firm	or	its	business	activities,	or
your	 employment	 was	 terminated	 for	 Cause	 (see	 section	 captioned	 “Definitions”	 below)	 or,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 a	 determination	 after	 the
termination	of	your	employment,	that	your	employment	could	have	been	terminated	for	Cause.

Subject	 to	 these	 terms	 and	 conditions	 (including,	 but	 not	 limited	 to,	 sections	 captioned	 “Protection-Based	 Vesting”,	 “Bonus	 Recoupment”,
“Recapture	Provisions”,	“Your	Obligations”	and	“Remedies”),	you	will	be	eligible	to	continue	to	vest	(as	you	otherwise	would	vest	if	you	were
still	employed	by	JPMorgan	Chase)	with	respect	to	your	award	in	accordance	with	its	terms	and	conditions	following	the	termination	of	your
employment	if	one	of	the	following	circumstances	applies	to	you:

Job	Elimination
In	the	event	that	the	Director	of	Human	Resources	or	nominee	in	his	or	her	sole	discretion	determines	that
•
•

the	Firm	terminated	your	employment	because	your	job	was	eliminated,	and
after	 you	 are	 notified	 that	 your	 job	 will	 be	 eliminated,	 you	 provided	 such	 services	 as	 requested	 by	 the	 Firm	 in	 a	 cooperative	 and
professional	manner,	and
you	satisfied	the	Release/Certification	Requirements	set	forth	below.

•

Full	Career	Eligibility
In	the	event	that	the	Director	of	Human	Resources	or	nominee	in	his	or	her	sole	discretion	determines	that
•

you	 voluntarily	 terminated	 your	 employment	 with	 the	 Firm,	 had	 completed	 at	 least	 five	 years	 of	 continuous	 service	 with	 the	 Firm
immediately	preceding	your	termination	date,	and
the	sum	of	your	age	and	Recognized	Service	(as	defined	below)	on	your	date	of	termination	equaled	or	exceeded	60	and
you	provided	at	least	180	days	advance	written	notice	to	the	Firm	of	your	intention	to	voluntarily	terminate	your	employment	under	this
provision,	during	which	notice	period	you	provided	such	services	as	requested	by	the	Firm	in	a	cooperative	and	professional	manner	and
you	did	not	perform	any	services	for	any	other	employer,	and
continued	 vesting	 shall	 be	 appropriate,	 which	 determination	 shall	 be	 made	 prior	 to	 your	 termination	 and	 will	 be	 based	 on	 your
performance	and	conduct	(before	and	after	providing	notice),	and
for	36	months	from	the	date	of	grant	of	this	award	you	do	not	either	perform	services	in	any	capacity	(such	as	an	employee,	contractor,
consultant,	advisor,	or	self-employed	individual,	whether	paid	or	unpaid)	for	a	Financial	Services	Company	(as	defined	below)	or	work	in
your	profession	(whether	or	not	for	a	Financial	Services	Company);	provided	that	you	may	work	for	a	government,	education	or	Not-for-
Profit	Organization	(as	defined	below),	and

After	receipt	of	such	advance	written	notice,	the	Firm	may	choose	to	have	you	continue	to	provide	services	during	such	180-day	period	as	a
condition	to	continued	vesting	or	shorten	the	length	of	the	180-day	period	at	the	Firm’s	sole	discretion,	but	to	a	date	no	earlier	than	the	date
you	would	otherwise	meet	the	age	and	service	requirements.

•

your	 employment	 with	 the	 Firm	 terminates	 because	 (i)	 you	 are	 unable	 to	 return	 to	 work	 while	 you	 are	 receiving	 benefits	 under	 the

plan	(in	either	case,	“LTD	Plan”),	or	(ii)	if	you	are	not	covered	by	a	LTD	Plan,	you	are	unable	to	return	to	work	due	to	a	long-term	disability
that	would	qualify	for	benefits	under	the	applicable	LTD	Plan,	as	determined	by	the	Firm	or	a	third-party	designated	by	the	Firm;	provided
that	you	(x)	request	in	writing	continued	vesting	due	to	such	disability	within	30	days	of	the	date	your	employment	terminates,	and	(y)
provide	any	requested	supporting	documentation	and	(z)	receive	the	Firm’s	written	consent	to	such	treatment,	and
you	satisfied	the	Release/Certification	Requirements	set	forth	below.

•

Release/Certification
To	qualify	for	continued	vesting	after	termination	of	your	employment	under	any	of	the	foregoing	circumstances:

•

•

•

•

•

you	must	timely	execute	and	deliver	a	release	of	claims	in	favor	of	the	Firm,	having	such	form	and	terms	as	the	Firm	shall	specify,

with	respect	to	“Full	Career	Eligibility”,	prior	to	the	termination	of	your	employment,	you	must	confirm	with	management	that	you	meet

the	eligibility	criteria	(including	providing	at	least	180	days	advance	written	notification),	advise	that	you	are	seeking	to	be	treated	as	an

individual	eligible	for	“Full	Career	Eligibility”,	and	receive	written	consent	to	such	continued	vesting,

with	respect	to	“Full	Career	Eligibility”	and	“Government	Office”,	it	is	your	responsibility	to	take	the	appropriate	steps	to	certify	to	the
Firm	prior	to	each	vesting	date	while	the	employment	restrictions	are	outstanding,	on	the	authorized	form	of	the	Firm,	that	you	have
complied	with	the	employment	restrictions	applicable	to	you	(as	described	herein)	from	your	date	of	termination	of	employment	through
the	applicable	vesting	date,
with	 respect	 to	 “Disability”,	 you	 must	 satisfy	 the	 notice	 and	 documentation	 described	 above	 and	 receive	 written	 consent	 to	 such
continued	vesting,	and
in	all	cases,	complied	with	all	other	terms	of	the	Award	Agreement.		(See	section	captioned	“Your	Obligations”.)

Death
If	you	die	while	you	are	eligible	to	vest	in	RSUs	under	this	award,	the	RSUs	will	immediately	vest	and	will	be	distributed	in	shares	of	Common	Stock
(after	applicable	tax	withholding)	to	your	designated	beneficiary	on	file	with	the	Firm’s	Stock	Administration	Department,	or	if	no	beneficiary	has
been	 designated	 or	 survives	 you	 or	 if	 beneficiary	 designation	 is	 not	 recognized	 by	 local	 legislation,	 then	 to	 your	 estate.	 	 Any	 shares	 will	 be
distributed	no	later	than	the	end	of	the	calendar	year	immediately	following	the	calendar	year	which	contains	your	date	of	death;	however,	our
administrative	 practice	 is	 to	 register	 such	 shares	 in	 the	 name	 of	 your	 beneficiary	 or	 estate	 within	 60	 days	 of	 the	 Firm’s	 receipt	 of	 any	 required
documentation.

Your Obligations
In	 consideration	 of	 the	 grant	 of	 this	 award,	 you	 agree	 to	 comply	 with	 and	 be	 bound	 by	 the	 obligations	 set	 forth	 below	 next	 to	 the	 subsections
captioned	“--Non-Solicitation	of	Employees	and	Customers”,	“--Confidential	Information”,	“--Non-Disparagement”,	”--Cooperation”,	“--Compliance
with	Award	Agreement”	and	“--Notice	Period.”

Non-Solicitation	of	Employees	and	Customers
During	your	employment	by	the	Firm	and	for	the	longer	of	the	(i)	one	year	period	following	the	termination	of	your	employment	or,	(ii)	if	your
award	is	not	cancelled	as	of	your	termination	date,	the	three	year	period	from	Grant	Date,	you	will	not	directly	or	indirectly,	whether	on	your
own	 behalf	 or	 on	 behalf	 of	 any	 other	 party,	 without	 the	 prior	 written	 consent	 of	 the	 Director	 of	 Human	 Resources:	 (i)	 solicit,	 induce	 or
encourage	any	of	the	Firm’s	then	current	employees	to	leave	the	Firm	or	to	apply	for	employment	elsewhere,	unless	such	current	employee
has	received	official,	written	notice	that	his	or	her	employment	will	be	terminated	due	to	job	elimination,	(ii)	hire	any	employee	or	former
employee	who	was	employed	by	the	Firm	at	the	date	your	employment	terminated,	unless	the	individual’s	employment	terminated	because
his	or	her	job	was	eliminated,	or	the	individual’s	employment	with	the	Firm	has	been	terminated	for	more	than	six	months,	(iii)	to	the	fullest
extent	enforceable	under	applicable	law,	solicit	or	induce	or	attempt	to	induce	to	leave	the	Firm,	or	divert	or	attempt	to	divert	from	doing
business	with	the	Firm,	any	then	current	customers,	suppliers	or	other	persons	or	entities	that	were	serviced	by	you	or	whose	names	became
known	to	you	by	virtue	of	your	employment	with	the	Firm,	or	otherwise	interfere	with	the	relationship	between	the	Firm	and	such	customers,
suppliers	or	other	persons	or	entities.		This	does	not	apply	to	publicly	known	institutional	customers	that	you	service	after	your	employment
with	the	Firm	without	the	use	of	the	Firm’s	confidential	or	proprietary	information.

These	restrictions	do	not	apply	to	authorized	actions	you	take	in	the	normal	course	of	your	employment	with	the	Firm,	such	as	employment
decisions	with	respect	to	employees	you	supervise	or	business	referrals	in	accordance	with	the	Firm’s	policies.

Confidential	Information
You	will	not,	either	during	your	employment	with	the	Firm	or	thereafter,	directly	or	indirectly	(i)	use	or	disclose	to	anyone	any	confidential
information	related	to	the	Firm’s	business,	or	(ii)	communicate	with	the	press	or	other	media	about	matters	related	to	the	Firm,	its	customers
or	employees,	including	matters	and	activities	relating	to	your	employment,	or	the	employment	of	others,	by	the	Firm,	in	the	case	of	either	(i)
or	 (ii),	 except	 as	 explicitly	 permitted	 by	 the	 JPMorgan	 Chase	 Code	 of	 Conduct	 and	 applicable	 policies	 or	 law	 or	 legal	 process.		 In	 addition,

following	your	termination	of	employment,	you	will	not,	without	prior	written	authorization,	access	the	Firm’s	private	and	internal	information
through	telephonic,	intranet	or	internet	means.		“Confidential	information”	shall	have	the	same	meaning	for	the	Award	Agreement	as	it	has	in
the	JPMorgan	Chase	Code	of	Conduct.

Nothing	 in	 this	 award	 precludes	 you	 from	 reporting	 to	 the	 Firm’s	 management	 or	 directors,	 the	 government,	 a	 regulator,	 a	 self-regulatory
agency,	your	attorneys	or	a	court,	conduct	you	believe	to	be	in	violation	of	the	law	or	concerns	of	any	known	or	suspected	Code	of	Conduct
violation.		It	is	also	not	intended	to	prevent	you	from	responding	truthfully	to	questions	or	requests	from	the	government,	a	regulator	or	in	a
court	of	law.

Non-Disparagement
You	will	not,	either	during	your	employment	with	the	Firm	or	thereafter,	make	or	encourage	others	to	make	any	public	statement	or	release
any	information	in	verbal,	written,	electronic	or	any	other	form,	that	is	intended	to,	or	reasonably	could	be	foreseen	to,	disparage,	embarrass
or	criticize	the	Firm	or	its	employees,	officers,	directors	or	shareholders	as	a	group.		This	shall	not	preclude	you	from	reporting	to	the	Firm’s
management	or	directors	or	to	the	government	or	a	regulator	conduct	you	believe	to	be	in	violation	of	the	law	or	the	Firm’s	Code	of	Conduct
or	responding	truthfully	to	questions	or	requests	for	information	to	the	government,	a	regulator	or	in	a	court	of	law	in	connection	with	a	legal
or	regulatory	investigation	or	proceeding.

Cooperation
You	will	cooperate	fully	with	and	provide	full	and	accurate	information	to	the	Firm	and	its	counsel	with	respect	to	any	matter	(including	any
audit,	tax	proceeding,	litigation,	investigation	or	governmental	proceeding)	with	respect	to	which	you	may	have	knowledge	or	information,
subject	to	reimbursement	for	actual,	appropriate	and	reasonable	out-of-pocket	expenses	incurred	by	you.

Compliance	with	Award	Agreement
You	will	provide	the	Firm	with	any	information	reasonably	requested	to	determine	compliance	with	the	Award	Agreement,	and	you	authorize
the	 Firm	 to	 disclose	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 Award	 Agreement	 to	 any	 third	 party	 who	 might	 be	 affected	 thereby,	 including	 your	 prospective
employer.

Notice	Period
If	you	are	subject	to	a	notice	period	or	become	subject	to	a	notice	period	after	the	Grant	Date,	whether	by	contract	or	by	policy,	that	requires
you	to	provide	advance	written	notice	of	your	intention	to	terminate	your	employment	(“Notice	Period”),	then	as	consideration	for	this	award
and	 continued	 employment,	 you	 will	 provide	 the	 Firm	 with	 the	 necessary	 advance	 written	 notice	 that	 applies	 to	 you,	 as	 specified	 by	 such
contract	or	policy.

After	receipt	of	your	notice,	the	Firm	may	choose	to	have	you	continue	to	provide	services	during	the	applicable	Notice	Period	or	may	place
you	on	a	paid	leave	for	all	or	part	of	the	applicable	Notice	Period.		During	the	Notice	Period,	you	shall	continue	to	devote	your	full	time	and
loyalty	to	the	Firm	by	providing	services	in	a	cooperative	and	professional	manner	and	not	perform	any	services	for	any	other	employer	and
shall	 receive	 your	 base	 salary	 and	 certain	 benefits	 until	 your	 employment	 terminates.		 You	 and	 the	 Firm	 may	 mutually	 agree	 to	 waive	 or
modify	the	length	of	the	Notice	Period.

Regardless	 of	 whether	 a	 Notice	 Period	 applies	 to	 you,	 you	 must	 comply	 with	 the	 180-day	 advance	 notice	 period	 described	 under	 the
subsection	captioned	“--Full	Career	Eligibility”	in	the	event	you	wish	to	terminate	employment	under	that	same	subsection.

Remedies
Cancellation
In	 addition	 to	 the	 cancellation	 provisions	 described	 under	 the	 sections	 captioned	 “Protection-Based	 Vesting”,	 “Bonus	 Recoupment”,	 “Recapture
Provisions”	 and	 “Termination	 of	 Employment”,	 your	 outstanding	 RSUs	 under	 this	 award	 may	 be	 cancelled	 if	 the	 Firm	 in	 its	 sole	 discretion
determines	that:

•

•
•

you	 have	 failed	 to	 comply	 with	 any	 of	 the	 advance	 notice/cooperation	 requirements	 or	 employment	 restrictions	 applicable	 to	 your
termination	of	employment,	or
you	have	failed	to	return	the	required	forms	specified	under	the	section	captioned	“Release/Certification”	by	the	specified	deadline,	or
you	have	violated	any	of	the	provisions	as	set	forth	above	in	the	section	captioned	“Your	Obligations”.

To	the	extent	provided	under	the	subsection	captioned	“--Amendment”	below,	JPMorgan	Chase	reserves	the	right	to	suspend	vesting	of	this	award
and/or	 distribution	 of	 shares	 under	 this	 award,	 including,	 without	 limitation,	 during	 any	 period	 that	 JPMorgan	 Chase	 is	 evaluating	 whether	 this
award	is	subject	to	cancellation	and/or	recovery	and/or	whether	the	conditions	for	distributions	of	shares	under	this	award	are	satisfied.		JPMorgan
Chase	is	not	responsible	for	any	price	fluctuations	during	any	period	of	suspension	and,	if	applicable,	suspended	units	will	be	reinstated	consistent
with	Plan	administration	procedures.	See	also	subsection	captioned	“--No	Ownership	Rights/Other	Limitations”.

Recovery
In	addition,	you	may	be	required	to	pay	the	Firm	up	to	an	amount	equal	to	the	Fair	Market	Value	(determined	as	of	the	applicable	vesting	date)	of
the	gross	number	of	shares	of	Common	Stock	previously	distributed	under	this	award	as	follows:

•

Payment	 may	 be	 required	 with	 respect	 to	 any	 shares	 of	 Common	 Stock	 distributed	 within	 the	 three	 year	 period	 prior	 to	 a	 notice-of-
recovery	under	this	section,	if	the	Firm	in	its	sole	discretion	determines	that:

◦
◦
◦

you	committed	a	fraudulent	act,	or	engaged	in	knowing	and	willful	misconduct	related	to	your	employment,	or
you	violated	any	of	the	provisions	as	set	forth	above	in	the	section	captioned	“Your	Obligations”,	or
you	 violated	 the	 employment	 restrictions	 set	 forth	 in	 the	 subsection	 “--Full	 Career	 Eligibility”	 or	 “--Government	 Office”
following	the	termination	of	your	employment.

•

In	addition,	payment	may	be	required	with	respect	to	any	shares	distributed	within	the	one	year	period	prior	to	notice-of-recovery	under
this	 section,	 if	 the	 Firm	 in	 its	 sole	 discretion	 determines	 appropriate	 pursuant	 to	 the	 provisions	 in	 the	 section	 captioned	 “Recapture
Provisions”.

Notice-of-recovery	 under	 this	 subsection	 is	 a	 written	 (including	 electronic)	 notice	 from	 the	 Firm	 to	 you	 either	 requiring	 payment	 under	 this
subsection	 or	 stating	 that	 JPMorgan	 Chase	 is	 evaluating	 requiring	 payment	 under	 this	 subsection.	 	 Without	 limiting	 the	 foregoing,	 notice-of-
recovery	will	be	deemed	provided	if	the	Firm	makes	a	good	faith	attempt	to	provide	written	(including	electronic)	notice	at	your	last	known	address
maintained	 in	 the	 Firm’s	 employment	 records.	 	 For	 the	 avoidance	 of	 doubt,	 a	 notice-of-recovery	 that	 the	 Firm	 is	 evaluating	 requiring	 payment
under	this	subsection	shall	preserve	JPMorgan	Chase’s	rights	to	require	payment	as	set	forth	above	in	all	respects	and	the	Firm	shall	be	under	no
obligation	to	complete	its	evaluation	other	than	as	the	Firm	may	determine	in	its	sole	discretion.

For	purposes	of	this	subsection,	shares	distributed	under	this	award	include	shares	withheld	for	tax	purposes.		However,	it	is	the	Firm’s	intention
that	 you	 only	 be	 required	 to	 pay	 the	 amounts	 under	 this	 subsection	 with	 respect	 to	 shares	 that	 are	 or	 may	 be	 retained	 by	 you	 following	 a
determination	of	tax	liability	and	that	you	will	not	be	required	to	pay	amounts	with	respect	to	shares	representing	irrevocable	tax	withholdings	or
tax	payments	previously	made	(whether	by	you	or	the	Firm)	that	you	will	not	be	able	to	recover,	recapture	or	reclaim	(including	as	a	tax	credit,
refund	 or	 other	 benefit).	 	 Accordingly,	 JPMorgan	 Chase	 will	 not	 require	 you	 to	 pay	 any	 amount	 that	 the	 Firm	 or	 its	 nominee	 in	 his	 or	 her	 sole
discretion	determines	is	represented	by	such	withholdings	or	tax	payments.

Payment	 may	 be	 made	 in	 shares	 of	 Common	 Stock	 or	 in	 cash.	 	 You	 agree	 that	 any	 repayment	 will	 be	 a	 lawful	 recovery	 under	 the	 terms	 and
conditions	of	your	Award	Agreement	and	is	not	to	be	construed	in	any	manner	as	a	penalty.

Nothing	in	the	section	in	any	way	limits	your	obligations	under	“Bonus	Recoupment”.

Right	to	an	Injunction
You	acknowledge	that	a	violation	or	attempted	violation	of	the	obligations	set	forth	herein	will	cause	immediate	and	irreparable	damage	to	the
Firm,	and	therefore	agree	that	the	Firm	shall	be	entitled	as	a	matter	of	right	to	an	injunction,	from	any	court	of	competent	jurisdiction,	restraining
any	violation	or	further	violation	of	such	obligations;	such	right	to	an	injunction,	however,	shall	be	cumulative	and	in	addition	to	whatever	other
remedies	the	Firm	may	have	under	law	or	equity.

Administrative Provisions

Withholding	Taxes:	As	a	result	of	legal	and/or	tax	obligations	the	Firm,	in	its	sole	discretion,	may	(i)	retain	from	each	distribution	the	number	of
shares	 of	 Common	 Stock	 required	 to	 satisfy	 applicable	 tax	 obligations	 or	 (ii)	 implement	 any	 other	 desirable	 or	 necessary	 procedures,	 so	 that
appropriate	 withholding	 and	 other	 taxes	 are	 paid	 to	 the	 competent	 authorities	 with	 respect	 to	 the	 vested	 shares,	 dividend	 equivalents	 and	 the
award.		This	may	include	but	is	not	limited	to	(i)	a	market	sale	of	a	number	of	such	shares	on	your	behalf	substantially	equal	to	the	withholding	or
other	taxes,	(ii)	to	the	extent	required	by	law,	withhold	from	cash	compensation,	an	amount	equal	to	any	withholding	obligation	with	respect	to	the
award,	shares	that	vest	under	this	award,	and/or	dividend	equivalents,	and	(iii)	retaining	shares	that	vest	under	this	award	or	dividend	equivalents
until	you	pay	any	taxes	associated	with	the	award,	vested	shares	and/or	the	dividend	equivalents	directly	to	the	competent	authorities.

Right	to	Set	Off:	Although	the	Firm	expects	to	settle	this	award	in	share(s)	of	Common	Stock	as	of	the	applicable	vesting	date,	as	set	forth	in	your
Award	 Agreement,	 the	 Firm	 may,	 to	 the	 maximum	 extent	 permitted	 by	 applicable	 law	 (including	 Section	 409A	 of	 the	 Code	 to	 the	 extent	 it	 is
applicable	to	you),	retain	for	itself	funds	or	the	Common	Stock	resulting	from	any	vesting	of	this	award	to	satisfy	any	obligation	or	debt	that	you
owe	to	the	Firm.		Notwithstanding	any	account	agreement	with	the	Firm	to	the	contrary,	the	Firm	will	not	recoup	or	recover	any	amount	owed
from	 any	 funds	 or	 unrestricted	 securities	 held	 in	 your	 name	 and	 maintained	 at	 the	 Firm	 pursuant	 to	 such	 account	 agreement	 to	 satisfy	 any
obligation	 or	 debt	 owed	 by	 you	 under	 this	 award	 without	 your	 consent.	 	 This	 restriction	 on	 the	 Firm	 does	 not	 apply	 to	 accounts	 described	 and
authorized	in	“No	Ownership	Rights/Other	Limitations”	described	below.

No	Ownership	Rights/Other	Limitations:		RSUs	do	not	convey	the	rights	of	ownership	of	Common	Stock	and	do	not	carry	voting	rights.		No	shares
of	Common	Stock	will	be	issued	to	you	until	after	the	RSUs	have	vested.		Shares	will	be	issued	in	accordance	with	JPMorgan	Chase’s	procedures	for
issuing	stock.		By	accepting	this	award,	you	authorize	the	Firm,	in	its	sole	discretion,	to	establish	on	your	behalf	a	brokerage	account	in	your	name
with	the	Firm	or	book-entry	account	with	our	stock	plan	administrator	and/or	transfer	agent	and	deliver	to	that	account	any	vested	shares	derived
from	the	award.		You	also	acknowledge	that	should	there	be	a	determination	that	the	cancellation	provisions	of	this	award	apply	during	the	period
when	the	vesting	of	any	outstanding	RSUs	has	been	suspended,	then	you	agree	that	such	RSUs	may	be	cancelled	in	whole	or	part.	(See	Sections
captioned	“Protection-Based	Vesting”,	“Bonus	Recoupment”,	“Recapture	Provisions”,	“Termination	of	Employment”	and	“Remedies”,	as	well	as	the
subsection	captioned	“--Amendment”	permitting	suspension	of	vesting.)

With	respect	to	any	applicable	vesting	date,	JPMorgan	Chase	may	impose	for	any	reason,	as	of	such	vesting	date	for	such	period	as	it	may	specify	in
its	sole	discretion,	such	restrictions	on	the	Common	Stock	to	be	issued	to	you	as	it	may	deem	appropriate,	including,	but	not	limited	to,	restricting
the	sale,	transfer,	pledging,	assignment,	hedging	or	encumbrance	of	such	shares	of	Common	Stock.	Such	restrictions	described	in	the	last	sentence

Recoupment”	and	“Remedies”.)

Binding	Agreement:	The	Award	Agreement	will	be	binding	upon	any	successor	in	interest	to	JPMorgan	Chase,	by	merger	or	otherwise.

Not	 a	 Contract	 of	 Employment:	 Nothing	 contained	 in	 the	 Award	 Agreement	 constitutes	 a	 contract	 of	 employment	 or	 continued	 employment.
Employment	is	“at-will”	and	may	be	terminated	by	either	you	or	JPMorgan	Chase	for	any	reason	at	any	time.		This	award	does	not	confer	any	right
or	entitlement	to,	nor	does	the	award	impose	any	obligation	on	the	Firm	to	provide,	the	same	or	any	similar	award	in	the	future	and	its	value	is	not
compensation	for	purposes	of	determining	severance.

Section	409A	Compliance:		To	the	extent	that	Section	409A	of	the	Code	is	applicable	to	this	award,	distributions	of	shares	and	cash	hereunder	are
intended	 to	 comply	 with	 Section	 409A	 of	 the	 Code,	 and	 the	 Award	 Agreement,	 including	 these	 terms	 and	 conditions,	 shall	 be	 interpreted	 in	 a
manner	consistent	with	such	intent.

Notwithstanding	anything	herein	to	the	contrary,	if	you	(i)	are	subject	to	taxation	under	the	Code,	(ii)	are	a	specified	employee	as	defined	in	the
JPMorgan	Chase	2005	Deferred	Compensation	Plan	and	(iii)	have	incurred	a		separation	from	service	(as	defined	in	that	Plan	with	the	exception	of
death)	 and	 if	 any	 units/shares	 under	 this	 award	 represent	 deferred	 compensation	 as	 defined	 in	 Section	 409A	 and	 such	 shares	 are	 distributable
(under	the	terms	of	this	award)	within	six	months	following,	and	as	a	result	of	your	separation	from	service,	then	those	shares	will	be	delivered	to
you	during	the	first	calendar	month	after	the	expiration	of	six	full	months	from	date	of	your	separation	from	service.		Further,	if	your	award	is	not
subject	to	a	substantial	risk	of	forfeiture	as	defined	by	regulations	issued	under	Section	409A	of	the	Code,	then	the	remainder	of	each	calendar	year
immediately	following	(i)	each	applicable	vesting	date	set	forth	in	your	Award	Agreement	shall	be	a	payment	date	for	purposes	of	distributing	the
vested	portion	of	the	award	and	(ii)	each	date	that	JPMorgan	Chase	specifies	for	payment	of	dividends	declared	on	its	Common	Stock,	shall	be	the
payment	date(s)	for	purposes	of	distributing	dividend	equivalent	payments.

Change	in	Outstanding	Shares:		In	the	event	of	any	change	in	the	outstanding	shares	of	Common	Stock	by	reason	of	any	stock	dividend	or	split,
recapitalization,	 issuance	 of	 a	 new	 class	 of	 common	 stock,	 merger,	 consolidation,	 spin-off,	 combination	 or	 exchange	 of	 shares	 or	 other	 similar
corporate	change,	or	any	distributions	to	stockholders	of	Common	Stock	other	than	regular	cash	dividends,	the	Committee	will	make	an	equitable
substitution	 or	 proportionate	 adjustment,	 in	 the	 number	 or	 kind	 of	 shares	 of	 Common	 Stock	 or	 other	 securities	 issued	 or	 reserved	 for	 issuance
pursuant	to	the	Plan	and	to	any	RSUs	outstanding	under	this	award	for	such	corporate	events.

Interpretation/Administration:	 	 The	 Committee	 has	 sole	 and	 complete	 authority	 to	 interpret	 and	 administer	 this	 Award	 Agreement,	 including,
without	 limitation,	 the	 power	 to	 (i)	 interpret	 the	 Plan	 and	 the	 terms	 of	 this	 Award	 Agreement;	 (ii)	 determine	 the	 reason	 for	 termination	 of
employment;	(iii)	determine	application	of	the	post-employment	obligations	and	cancellation	and	recovery	provisions;	(iv)	decide	all	claims	arising
with	 respect	 to	 this	 award;	 and	 (v)	 delegate	 such	 authority	 as	 it	 deems	 appropriate.	 	 Any	 determination	 contemplated	 hereunder	 by	 the
Committee,	the	Firm,	the	Director	of	Human	Resources	or	their	respective	delegates	or	nominees	shall	be	binding	on	all	parties.
Notwithstanding	 anything	 herein	 to	 the	 contrary,	 the	 determinations	 of	 the	 Director	 of	 Human	 Resources,	 the	 Firm,	 the	 Committee	 and	 their
respective	 delegates	 and	 nominees	 under	 the	 Plan	 and	 the	 Award	 Agreements	 are	 not	 required	 to	 be	 uniform.	 	 By	 way	 of	 clarification,	 the
Committee,	the	Firm,	the	Director	of	Human	Resources	and	their	respective	delegates	and	nominees	shall	be	entitled	to	make	non-uniform	and
selective	determinations	and	modifications	under	Award	Agreements	and	the	Plan.

Amendment:		The	Committee	or	its	nominee	reserves	the	right	to	amend	this	Award	Agreement	in	any	manner,	at	any	time	and	for	any	reason;
provided,	however,	that	no	such	amendment	shall	materially	adversely	affect	your	rights	under	this	Award	Agreement	without	your	consent	except
to	the	extent	that	the	Committee	or	its	delegate	considers	advisable	to	(x)	comply	with	applicable	laws	or	changes	in	or	interpretation	of	applicable
laws,	regulatory	requirements	and	accounting	rules	or	standards	and/or	(y)		make	a	change	in	a	scheduled	vesting	date	or	impose	the	restrictions
described	 above	 under	 “No	 Ownership	 Rights/Other	 Limitations”,	 in	 either	 case,	 to	 the	 extent	 permitted	 by	 Section	 409A	 of	 the	 Code	 if	 it	 is
applicable	to	you.		This	Award	Agreement	may	not	be	amended	except	in	writing	signed	by	the	Director	of	Human	Resources	of	JPMorgan	Chase.

Severability:	If	any	portion	of	the	Award	Agreement	is	determined	by	the	Firm	to	be	unenforceable	in	any	jurisdiction,	any	court	or	arbitrator	of
competent	jurisdiction	or	the	Director	of	Human	Resources	may	reform	the	relevant	provisions	(e.g.,	as	to	length	of	service,	time,	geographical	area
or	scope)	to	the	extent	the	Firm	(or	court/arbitrator)	considers	necessary	to	make	the	provision	enforceable	under	applicable	law.

Accelerated	 Distribution	 for	 Ethics	 or	 Conflict	 Reasons	 Resulting	 From	 Employment	 by	 a	 Government	 Entity:	 	 Upon	 receipt	 of	 satisfactory
evidence	that	applicable	United	States	federal,	state,	local,	foreign	or	supranational	ethics	or	conflict	of	interest	laws	or	regulations	require	you	to
divest	 your	 interest	 in	 JPMorgan	 Chase	 RSUs,	 the	 Firm	 may	 accelerate	 the	 distribution	 of	 all	 or	 part	 of	 your	 outstanding	 award	 effective	 on	 or
before	the	required	divestiture	date;	provided	that	no	accelerated	distribution	shall	occur	if	the	Firm	determines	that	such	acceleration	will	violate
Section	409A	of	the	Code.		Accelerated	distribution	under	this	paragraph	does	not	impact	the	dates	as	set	forth	in	the	“Recovery”	section	above.
The	time	period	for	recovery	shall	be	determined	by	the	originally	scheduled	vesting	date	or	distribution	date	prior	to	any	acceleration	event.

If	 you	 have	 voluntarily	 terminated	 your	 employment	 and	 have	 satisfied	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 section	 captioned	 “Government	 Office
Requirements”,	acceleration	shall	apply	(to	extent	required)	to	the	percentage	of	your	outstanding	award	that	would	continue	to	vest	under	that
section.		In	the	case	of	a	termination	of	employment	where	the	award	is	outstanding	as	a	result	of	the	subsections	entitled	“--Job	Elimination”	or	“--
Full	Career	Eligibility”,	then	acceleration	shall	apply,	to	the	extent	required,	to	the	full	outstanding	award.
Notwithstanding	accelerated	distribution	pursuant	to	the	foregoing,	you	will	remain	subject	to	the	applicable	terms	of	your	Award	Agreement	as	if
your	 award	 had	 remained	 outstanding	 for	 the	 duration	 of	 the	 original	 vesting	 period	 and	 shares	 had	 been	 distributed	 as	 scheduled	 as	 of	 each
applicable	vesting	date,	including,	but	not	limited	to,	repayment	obligations	set	forth	in	the	section	captioned	“Remedies”	and	the	employment
restrictions	 in	 the	 sections	 captioned	 “Protection-Based	 Vesting”	 and	 “Government	 Office	 Requirements”	 and	 the	 subsection	 “--Full	 Career
Eligibility”.

Use	of	Personal	Data:		By	accepting	this	award,	you	acknowledge	that	the	Firm	may	process	your	personal	data	for	the	purposes	of	providing	you
this	award	(to	include	registration	of	shares	and	units	or	establishing	a	brokerage	account	on	your	behalf)	and	disclosing	to	third	parties,	such	as
service	providers	or	tax	and	regulatory	authorities	(e.g.,	for	compensation	reporting	and	payroll	tax	withholding	purposes).			Additionally,	you	agree
that	the	Firm	may	transfer	your	personal	data	to	jurisdictions	that	do	not	afford	protections	equivalent	to	the	protections	in	the	country	in	which

District	Court	for	the	Southern	District	of	New	York	with	respect	to	any	judicial	proceeding	in	connection	with	this	award	or	the	Plan.		You	waive,	to
the	 fullest	 extent	 permitted	 by	 law,	 any	 objection	 to	 personal	 jurisdiction	 or	 to	 the	 laying	 of	 venue	 of	 such	 dispute	 and	 further	 agree	 not	 to

is	 the	 prevailing	 party,	 the	 Firm	 shall	 be	 entitled	 to	 recover	 from	 you	 its	 reasonable	 attorney	 fees	 and	 expenses	 incurred	 in	 such	 action	 or

Firm’s	By-Laws	in	the	event	of	such	a	suit	by	the	Firm.

Non-transferability:	Neither	this	award	or	any	other	outstanding	awards	of	RSUs,	nor	your	interests	or	rights	in	any	such	awards,	shall	be	assigned,

Protection-Based Vesting

This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date(s), provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting
date,  or  you  meet  the  requirements  for  continued  vesting  described  under  the  subsections  “--Job  Elimination”,  “--Full  Career  Eligibility”,  “--
Government  Office”  or  “--Disability”.    However,  vesting  and  the  number  of  RSUs  in  which  you  vest  are  subject  to  these  terms  and  conditions
(including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Recapture Provisions”, “Remedies” and the following protection-based vesting provision).

Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you during the vesting period (“At Risk RSUs”) may be cancelled
if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk RSUs
is appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:

•

•

•

•

Your performance in relation to the priorities for your position, or the Firm’s performance in relation to the priorities for which you share
responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the
CEO may consider in assessing performance are net income, total net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of
the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.
For  any  calendar  year  ending  during  the  vesting  period,  JPMorgan  Chase’s  annual  pre-tax  pre-provision  income  at  the  Firm  level  is
negative.
Awards  granted  to  participants  in  a  Line  of  Business  for  which  you  exercise,  or  during  the  vesting  period  exercised,  direct  or  indirect
responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.
The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.

In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling
you  to  continued  vesting  in  your  award  (or  potentially  acceleration  due  to  satisfaction  of  the  Government  Office  Requirements),  the  cancellation
circumstances described above will continue to apply to your At Risk RSUs pursuant to the subsection captioned “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics
or Conflict Reasons Resulting From Employment by a Government Entity”.

Any  determination  above  with  respect  to  protection-based  vesting  provisions  is  subject  to  ratification  by  the  Compensation  and  Management
Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In the case of an award to the CEO, all such determinations
shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.

Vesting Period

The period from the Grant Date to the last vesting date is the “vesting period” (see subsections captioned “--Amendment” pursuant to which the
Firm may extend the vesting period and “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered
shares of Common Stock following a vesting date).

Holding Requirement

As of each vesting date, you shall be entitled to a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of RSUs vesting on such date, less the
number being withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  You agree that the distribution made to you will be held in an account in your name
with  restrictions  preventing  you  from  transferring,  assigning,  hedging,  selling,  pledging  or  otherwise  encumbering  such  distribution  for  a  twelve
month period commencing with the vesting date.  Such restrictions shall lapse in event of your death.

Bonus Recoupment

In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy) as
in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded to you for performance year 2021 and to this award.  You
can access this policy as currently in effect by clicking the following link to the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Corporate Governance Principles web page and
scrolling to the Bonus Recoupment Policy located under the section titled “Other Matters”:

https://about.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/corporate-governance-principles

For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  nothing  in  these  terms  and  conditions  in  any  way  limits  the  rights  of  the  Firm  under  the  JPMorgan  Chase  Bonus
Recoupment Policy (or successor policy).

EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff

In consideration of grant of this award, and without prejudice to any other provision of this Award Agreement, you agree that you are subject to the
JPMorgan Chase EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff (and any applicable supplement(s) to that policy) or successor policy as in effect
from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded to you for performance year 2021 and to this award.

The provisions of the JPMorgan Chase EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff set out the terms and conditions applying to the grant of
this award which ensure that the Firm is able to meet its regulatory obligations to operate malus (reduce) and/or clawback (recover) to awards in
certain circumstances.  These include, but are not limited to, where (i) there is a material downturn in the Firm’s financial performance or (ii) where
the Firm is required to hold more capital. The circumstances in which the events at (i) and (ii) would occur are analogous to some of the
circumstances considered under the existing Firmwide terms and conditions, in particular the Bonus Recoupment Policy and the Protection Based
Vesting provisions.  You can access this policy as currently in effect in My Rewards through the following link:  https://

Recapture Provisions (Detrimental Conduct, Risk-Related and Other Recapture Provisions)

Notwithstanding any terms of this Award Agreement to the contrary, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel up to 100%
of your outstanding RSUs under this award and, to the extent set forth in “Remedies” below, to recover from you up to an amount equal to the Fair
Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed (including shares
withheld for tax purposes) under this award if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:

•

•
•
•

•

you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it  causes  material financial or reputational harm to the Firm  or its business
activities, or
this award was based on materially inaccurate performance metrics, whether or not you were responsible for the inaccuracy, or
this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or
you improperly or with gross negligence failed to identify, raise or assess, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks and/or
concerns with respect to risks material to the Firm or its business activities, or
your  employment  was  terminated  for  Cause  (see  section  captioned  “Definitions”  below)  or,  in  the  case  of  a  determination  after  the
termination of your employment, that your employment could have been terminated for Cause.

See section captioned “Remedies” for additional information.

Termination of Employment

Except  as  explicitly  set  forth  below  under  the  subsections  captioned  “--Job  Elimination”,  “--Full  Career  Eligibility”,  “--Government  Office”  or  “--
Disability” or under the section captioned “Death”, any RSUs outstanding under this award will be cancelled effective on the date your employment
with the Firm terminates for any reason.

Subject to these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “EMEA
Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff”, “Recapture Provisions”, “Your Obligations” and “Remedies”), you will be eligible to continue to vest (as

you otherwise would vest if you were still employed by JPMorgan Chase) with respect to your award in accordance with its terms and conditions
following the termination of your employment if one of the following circumstances applies to you:

•

Job Elimination

In the event that the Director of Human Resources or nominee in his or her sole discretion determines that

•
•

•

the Firm terminated your employment because your job was eliminated, and
after  you  are  notified  that  your  job  will  be  eliminated,  you  provided  such  services  as  requested  by  the  Firm  in  a  cooperative  and
professional manner, and
you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.

•

Full Career Eligibility

In the event that the Director of Human Resources or nominee in his or her sole discretion determines that

•

•

•

•

•

•

you  voluntarily  terminated  your  employment  with  the  Firm,  had  completed  at  least  five  years  of  continuous  service  with  the  Firm
immediately preceding your termination date, and
your Recognized Service (as defined below) on your date of termination equaled or exceeded 15 years, or your combined Recognized
Service with the Firm and external professional experience (as attested by you to the Firm) equaled or exceeded 30 years, and
you provided at least 180 days advance written notice to the Firm of your intention to voluntarily terminate your employment under
this  provision,  during  which  notice  period  you  provided  such  services  as  requested  by  the  Firm  in  a  cooperative  and  professional
manner and you did not perform any services for any other employer, and
continued  vesting  shall  be  appropriate,  which  determination  shall  be  made  prior  to  your  termination  and  will  be  based  on  your
performance and conduct (before and after providing notice), and
for 36 months from the date of grant of this award you do not either perform services in any capacity (such as an employee,
contractor, consultant, advisor, or self-employed individual, whether paid or unpaid) for a Financial Services Company (as defined
below) or work in your profession (whether or not for a Financial Services Company); provided that you may work for a government,
education or Not-for-Profit Organization (as defined below), and
you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.

After receipt of such advance written notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during such 180-day period as a
condition to continued vesting or shorten the length of the 180-day period at the Firm’s sole discretion, but to a date no earlier than the date
you would otherwise meet the service requirement.

Additional advance notice requirements may apply for employees subject to notice period policies (see “Notice Period” below).

• Government Office

In the event that you voluntarily terminate your employment with the Firm to accept a Government Office or become a candidate for an elective
Government Office, as described at the end of these terms and conditions under the section captioned “Government Office Requirements”.  See
also definition of Government Office in the section captioned “Definitions”.

• Disability

In the event that

•

•

your employment with the Firm terminates because (i) you are unable to return to work while you are receiving benefits under the
JPMorgan Chase Long Term Disability Plan, or for non-U.S. employees, under the equivalent JPMorgan Chase sponsored local country
plan (in either case, “LTD Plan”), or (ii) if you are not covered by a LTD Plan, you are unable to return to work due to a long-term
disability that would qualify for benefits under the applicable LTD Plan, as determined by the Firm or a third-party designated by the
Firm; provided that you (x) request in writing continued vesting due to such disability within 30 days of the date your employment
terminates,  and  (y)  provide  any  requested  supporting  documentation  and  (z)  receive  the  Firm’s  written  consent  to  such
treatment, and
you satisfied the Release/Certification Requirements set forth below.

Release/Certification

To qualify for continued vesting after termination of your employment under any of the foregoing circumstances:

•
•

•

•

•

you must timely execute and deliver a release of claims in favor of the Firm, having such form and terms as the Firm shall specify,
with respect to “Full Career Eligibility”, prior to the termination of your employment, you must confirm with management that you meet
the eligibility criteria (including providing at least 180 days advance written notification), advise that you are seeking to be treated as an
individual eligible for “Full Career Eligibility”, and receive written consent to such continued vesting,
with respect to “Full Career Eligibility” and “Government Office”, it is your responsibility to take the appropriate steps to certify to the Firm
prior to each vesting date while the employment restrictions are outstanding, on the authorized form of the Firm, that you have complied
with  the  employment  restrictions  applicable  to  you  (as  described  herein)  from  your  date  of  termination  of  employment  through  the
applicable vesting date,
with respect to “Disability”, you must satisfy the notice and documentation described above and receive written consent to such continued
vesting, and
in all cases, complied with all other terms of the Award Agreement.  (See section captioned “Your Obligations”.)

Death

If you die while you are eligible to vest in RSUs under this award, the RSUs will immediately vest and will be distributed in shares of Common Stock
(after applicable tax withholding) to your designated beneficiary on file with the Firm’s Stock Administration Department, or if no beneficiary has
been  designated  or  survives  you  or  if  beneficiary  designation  is  not  recognized  by  local  legislation,  then  to  your  estate.    Any  shares  will  be
distributed  no  later  than  the  end  of  the  calendar  year  immediately  following  the  calendar  year  which  contains  your  date  of  death;  however,  our
administrative  practice  is  to  register  such  shares  in  the  name  of  your  beneficiary  or  estate  within  60  days  of  the  Firm’s  receipt  of  any  required
documentation.

Your Obligations

In  consideration  of  the  grant  of  this  award,  you  agree  to  comply  with  and  be  bound  by  the  obligations  set  forth  below  next  to  the  subsections
captioned  “--Non-Solicitation  of  Employees  and  Customers”,  “--Confidential  Information”,  “--Non-Disparagement”,  ”--Cooperation”,  “--Compliance
with Award Agreement” and “--Notice Period.”

• Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers

During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment or, (ii) if your
award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your
own  behalf  or  on  behalf  of  any  other  party,  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Director  of  Human  Resources:  (i)  solicit,  induce  or
encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has
received official, written notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination, (ii) hire any employee or former employee
who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment terminated because his or her job
was  eliminated,  or  the  individual’s  employment  with  the  Firm  has  been  terminated  for  more  than  six  months,  (iii)  to  the  fullest  extent
enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business
with the Firm, any then current customers, suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to
you by virtue of your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, suppliers or
other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service after your employment with the Firm
without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information.

These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, such as employment
decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the Firm’s policies.

•

Confidential Information

You  will  not,  either  during  your  employment  with  the  Firm  or  thereafter,  directly  or  indirectly  (i)  use  or  disclose  to  anyone  any  confidential
information related to the Firm’s business, or (ii) communicate with the press or other media about matters related to the Firm, its customers
or employees, including matters and activities relating to your employment, or the employment of others, by the Firm, in the case of either (i)
or  (ii),  except  as  explicitly  permitted  by  the  JPMorgan  Chase  Code  of  Conduct  and  applicable  policies  or  law  or  legal  process.    In  addition,
following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private and internal information
through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  “Confidential information” shall have the same meaning for the Award Agreement as it has in
the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct.

Nothing  in  this  award  precludes  you  from  reporting  to  the  Firm’s  management  or  directors,  the  government,  a  regulator,  a  self-regulatory
agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct

violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a
court of law.

• Non-Disparagement

You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make or encourage others to make any public statement or release
any information in verbal, written, electronic or any other form, that is intended to, or reasonably could be foreseen to, disparage, embarrass
or criticize the Firm or its employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group.  This shall not preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s
management or directors or to the government or a regulator conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or the Firm’s Code of Conduct or
responding truthfully to questions or requests for information to the government, a regulator or in a court of law in connection with a legal or
regulatory investigation or proceeding.

•

•

Cooperation

You will cooperate fully with and provide full and accurate information to the Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter (including any
audit,  tax  proceeding,  litigation,  investigation  or  governmental  proceeding)  with  respect  to  which  you  may  have  knowledge  or  information,
subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you.

Compliance with Award Agreement

You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award Agreement, and you authorize
the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be affected thereby, including your prospective employer.

• Notice Period

If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or by policy, that requires
you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice Period”), then as consideration for this award
and  continued  employment,  you  will  provide  the  Firm  with  the  necessary  advance  written  notice  that  applies  to  you,  as  specified  by  such
contract or policy.

After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable Notice Period or may place you
on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty
to  the  Firm  by  providing  services  in  a  cooperative  and  professional  manner  and  not  perform  any  services  for  any  other  employer  and  shall
receive your base salary and certain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the
length of the Notice Period.

Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period described under the subsection
captioned “--Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment under that same subsection.

Remedies

•

Cancellation

In  addition  to  the  cancellation  provisions  described  under  the  sections  captioned  “Protection-Based  Vesting”,  “Bonus  Recoupment”,  “EMEA
Malus  and  Clawback  Policy  -  Identified  Staff”,  “Recapture  Provisions”  and  “Termination  of  Employment”,  your  outstanding  RSUs  under  this
award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:

•

•

•

you have failed to comply with any of the advance notice/cooperation requirements or employment restrictions applicable to your
termination of employment, or
you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “Release/Certification” by the specified deadline,
or
you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”.

To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this
award  and/or  distribution  of  shares  under  this  award,  including,  without  limitation,  during  any  period  that  JPMorgan  Chase  is  evaluating
whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are
satisfied.  JPMorgan Chase is not responsible for any price fluctuations during any period of suspension and, if applicable, suspended units will
be reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures. See also subsection captioned “--No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.

• Recovery

In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date)
of the gross number of shares of Common Stock previously distributed under this award as follows:

•

•

Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-
recovery under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:

◦
◦
◦

you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment, or
you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”, or
you  violated  the  employment  restrictions  set  forth  in  the  subsection  “--Full  Career  Eligibility”  or  “--Government  Office”
following the termination of your employment.

In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of-recovery
under  this  section,  if  the  Firm  in  its  sole  discretion  determines  appropriate  pursuant  to  the  provisions  in  the  section  captioned
“Recapture Provisions”.

Notice-of-recovery  under  this  subsection  is  a  written  (including  electronic)  notice  from  the  Firm  to  you  either  requiring  payment  under  this
subsection or stating  that  JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-
recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known
address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring
payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall
be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.

For  purposes  of  this  subsection,  shares  distributed  under  this  award  include  shares  withheld  for  tax  purposes.    However,  it  is  the  Firm’s
intention  that  you  only  be  required  to  pay  the  amounts  under  this  subsection  with  respect  to  shares  that  are  or  may  be  retained  by  you
following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax
withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including
as a tax credit, refund or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in his
or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.

Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and
conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.

Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment” and “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff”.

• Right to an Injunction

You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the
Firm,  and  therefore  agree  that  the  Firm  shall  be  entitled  as  a  matter  of  right  to  an  injunction,  from  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,
restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to
whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.

Administrative Provisions

Withholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of
shares  of  Common  Stock  required  to  satisfy  applicable  tax  obligations  or  (ii)  implement  any  other  desirable  or  necessary  procedures,  so  that
appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include
but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the
extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that
vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and/or vested shares
directly to the competent authorities.

Right to Set Off: Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your
Award  Agreement,  the  Firm  may,  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law  (including  Section  409A  of  the  Code  to  the  extent  it  is
applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe
to the Firm.  Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any
funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt
owed  by  you  under  this  award  without  your  consent.    This  restriction  on  the  Firm  does  not  apply  to  accounts  described  and  authorized  in  “No
Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.

No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  RSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of
Common Stock will be issued to you until after the RSUs have vested.  Shares will be issued in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for
issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish on your behalf a brokerage account in your name

with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and deliver to that account any vested shares derived
from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation provisions of this award apply during the period
when the vesting of any outstanding RSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such RSUs may be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections
captioned  “Protection-Based  Vesting”,  “Bonus  Recoupment”,  “EMEA  Malus  and  Clawback  Policy  -  Identified  Staff”,  “Recapture  Provisions”,
“Termination of Employment” and “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)

With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in
its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting
the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence
shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during
such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to
pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to
such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above).  (See Sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment”
and “Remedies”.)

Binding Agreement: The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.

Not  a  Contract  of  Employment:  Nothing  contained  in  the  Award  Agreement  constitutes  a  contract  of  employment  or  continued  employment.
Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time.  This award does not confer any right or
entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not
compensation for purposes of determining severance.

Section 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended
to  comply  with  Section  409A  of  the  Code,  and  the  Award  Agreement,  including  these  terms  and  conditions,  shall  be  interpreted  in  a  manner
consistent with such intent.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the
JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a  separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of
death)  and  if  any  units/shares  under  this  award  represent  deferred  compensation  as  defined  in  Section  409A  and  such  shares  are  distributable
(under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered to
you during the first calendar month after the expiration of six full months from date of your separation from service.  Further, if your award is not
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year
immediately  following  each  applicable  vesting  date  set  forth  in  your  Award  Agreement  shall  be  a  payment  date  for  purposes  of  distributing  the
vested portion of the award.

Change in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split,
recapitalization,  issuance  of  a  new  class  of  common  stock,  merger,  consolidation,  spin-off,  combination  or  exchange  of  shares  or  other  similar
corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable
substitution  or  proportionate  adjustment,  in  the  number  or  kind  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  other  securities  issued  or  reserved  for  issuance
pursuant to the Plan and to any RSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.

Interpretation/Administration:    The  Committee  has  sole  and  complete  authority  to  interpret  and  administer  this  Award  Agreement,  including,
without  limitation,  the  power  to  (i)  interpret  the  Plan  and  the  terms  of  this  Award  Agreement;  (ii)  determine  the  reason  for  termination  of
employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising
with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee,
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.

Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the  contrary,  the  determinations  of  the  Director  of  Human  Resources,  the  Firm,  the  Committee  and  their
respective  delegates  and  nominees  under  the  Plan  and  the  Award  Agreements  are  not  required  to  be  uniform.    By  way  of  clarification,  the
Committee,  the  Firm,  the  Director  of  Human  Resources  and  their  respective  delegates  and  nominees  shall  be  entitled  to  make  non-uniform  and
selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.

Amendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason;
provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except
to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable
laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y)  make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions
described  above  under  “No  Ownership  Rights/Other  Limitations”,  in  either  case,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  Section  409A  of  the  Code  if  it  is
applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase.

Severability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of
competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area
or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.

Accelerated  Distribution  for  Ethics  or  Conflict  Reasons  Resulting  From  Employment  by  a  Government  Entity:    Upon  receipt  of  satisfactory
evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to
divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase RSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before
the required divestiture date; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that such acceleration will violate Section
409A of the Code.  Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Recovery” section above.  The time
period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.

If  you  have  voluntarily  terminated  your  employment  and  have  satisfied  the  requirements  of  the  section  captioned  “Government  Office
Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that
section.  In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “--Job Elimination” or “--
Full Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.

Notwithstanding accelerated distribution pursuant to the foregoing, you will remain subject to the applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if
your  award  had  remained  outstanding  for  the  duration  of  the  original  vesting  period  and  shares  had  been  distributed  as  scheduled  as  of  each
applicable  vesting  date,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  repayment  obligations  set  forth  in  the  section  captioned  “Remedies”  and  the  employment
restrictions  in  the  sections  captioned  “Protection-Based  Vesting”  and  “Government  Office  Requirements”  and  the  subsection  “--Full  Career
Eligibility”.

this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as
service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree
that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect
to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be
cancelled.

Governing Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of
law principles.

an  arbitration  agreement  between  you  and  the  Firm,  any  dispute  arising  directly  or  indirectly  in  connection  with  this  award  or  the  Plan  shall  be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the
event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence
any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.

Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims: By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with
the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual
basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class
action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.

Litigation:  By  accepting  any  award  under  the  Plan,  you  agree  (and  have  agreed)  that  in  any  action  or  proceeding  by  the  Firm  (other  than  a
derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm
is  the  prevailing  party,  the  Firm  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  from  you  its  reasonable  attorney  fees  and  expenses  incurred  in  such  action  or
proceeding. In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the
Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm.

Non-transferability: Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of RSUs, nor your interests or rights in any such awards, shall be assigned,
pledged, transferred, hedged, hypothecated or subject to any lien.  An award may be transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or
by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.

Outstanding Awards: The Administrative provisions set forth above shall apply to any award of RSUs outstanding as of the date hereof, and

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ______________, 20____
PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARD
OPERATING COMMITTEE
 (Protection-Based Vesting Provisions)

Award Agreement

These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of ________________, 20____ (“Grant Date”) awarding performance share units
(“PSUs”) pursuant to the terms of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Plan”). To the extent the terms of the Award Agreement
(all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the Plan and
Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this award.

This  award  was  granted  on  the  Grant  Date  subject  to  the  Award  Agreement  and  Plan.    Unless  you  decline  by  the  deadline  and  in  the  manner
specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline
the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the
Plan.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its subsidiaries as the “Firm”.

Form and Purpose of Award

Each PSU represents a non-transferable right to receive one share of Common Stock as of the vesting date as set forth in your Award Agreement.

The  purpose  of  this  award  is  to  further  emphasize  sustained  long-term  performance  and  to  align  your  interests  with  those  of  the  Firm  and  its
shareholders.

Protection-Based Vesting

This award is intended and expected to vest on the vesting date, provided that you are continuously employed by the Firm through such vesting
date,  or  you  meet  the  requirements  for  continued  vesting  described  under  the  subsections  “--Job  Elimination”,  “--Full  Career  Eligibility”,  “--
Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms and conditions (including,
but  not  limited  to,  sections  captioned  “Number  to  Vest  on  Vesting  Date”,  “Capital  Ratio  Performance  Threshold”,  “Recapture  Provisions”,
“Remedies” and the following protection-based vesting provision).

Up  to  a  total  of  fifty  percent  of  your  award  (including  any  associated  Reinvested  Dividend  Equivalent  Share  Units)  that  would  otherwise  be
distributable to you on the vesting date (“At Risk PSUs”) may be cancelled if the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his
or  her  sole  discretion  that  cancellation  of  all  or  portion  of  the  At  Risk  PSUs  is  appropriate  in  light  of  any  one  or  a  combination  of  the  following
factors:

• Your  performance  in  relation  to  the  priorities  for  your  position,  or  the  Firm’s  performance  in  relation  to  the  priorities  for  which  you  share
responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may
consider  in  assessing  performance  are:  net  income,  total  net  revenue,  earnings  per  share  and  capital  ratios  of  the  Firm,  both  on  an  absolute
basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.

• For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.
• RSU  awards  granted  to  participants  in  a  Line  of  Business  for  which  you  exercise,  or  during  the  vesting  period  exercised,  direct  or  indirect
responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.

• The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.

For avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur prior to the end of the
Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the end of the Performance Period will be up to fifty
percent of the Target Award Number.

In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling
you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation
circumstances described above will continue to apply.

Any  determination  above  with  respect  to  protection-based  vesting  provisions  is  subject  to  ratification  by  the  Compensation  and  Management
Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such
determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.

Number to Vest on the Vesting Date

Subject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:

Performance calculation:  On the vesting date, you will vest in a number of PSUs derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the Award
Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table.  See sections captioned “Calculation of Performance Ranking” and “Definitions”.

You will also vest in additional shares of Common Stock as calculated under the section captioned, “Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units”.
Delivery of vested shares to your account will be made not later than the date specified in the last sentence of the subsection captioned “Section
409A Compliance”.

Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units

If dividends are paid on Common Stock during the Vesting Period while the award is outstanding, you will receive on the vesting date additional units
representing shares of Common Stock as calculated in this section.  The number, if any, will be based on the dividends that would have been paid
during the Vesting Period as of each dividend payment date on the actual number of shares of Common Stock distributable to you resulting from the
vesting of the PSUs, if any, and treated as reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock on each dividend payment based on the Fair Market
Value of one share of Common Stock on each dividend payment date (“Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units”).

Holding Requirement

As of the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, you shall be entitled to be issued a number of shares of the Common Stock of JPMorgan
Chase equal to the number of PSUs, if any, plus any additional Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, vesting on such date, less the number
withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  The net number of shares issued to you will be held in an account in your name with restrictions
preventing you from transferring, assigning, hedging, selling, pledging or otherwise encumbering such shares for a two year period commencing as
of the vesting date and ending as of the second anniversary of the vesting date.  Such restrictions shall only lapse, prior to the expiration of the two
year holding period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons.  See section captioned, “Death” and
subsection captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by a Government Entity”.

Calculation of Performance Ranking

For  purposes  of  the  Performance  Ranking,  the  ranking  of  the  Firm  and  of  each  Performance  Company  for  the  Performance  Period  shall  be
determined  and  calculated  by  the  Calculation  Agent,  using  the  definitions  of  “Average  Tangible  Common  Equity”  (if  otherwise  applicable),
“Calculated  PSUs”,  “Firm  Reported  ROTCE”,  “Performance  Table”  (including  its  footnote)  and  “ROTCE”  as  set  forth  in  the  “Definitions”  section  of
these terms and conditions.  See section captioned “Definitions”.  Except for Firm Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the
second place (i.e. xx.yy%), rounded to the nearest hundredth.  See section captioned, “Definitions--Performance Table” in the event of a tie.  All
performance based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.

Capital Ratio Performance Threshold

Unvested  PSUs  are  subject  to  reduction  if  the  Firm’s  Common  Equity  Tier  1  (CET1)  capital  ratio  at  any  year  end  falls  below  a  predetermined
threshold of ______%.

If the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to one-third of the Target
Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year.

Vesting Period

The period from the Grant Date to the vesting date is the “Vesting Period”. (See “Administrative Provision--Amendment” pursuant to which the Firm
may extend the vesting period and “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” pursuant to which the Firm may place restrictions on delivered shares
of Common Stock following the vesting date and section captioned, “Holding Period” above.)

Bonus Recoupment

In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy) as
in effect from time to time as it applies both to the cash incentive compensation awarded to you for performance year 20______ and to this award.  You

scrolling to the Bonus Recoupment Policy located under the section titled “Other Matters”:

https://about.jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/corporate-governance-principles

For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  nothing  in  these  terms  and  conditions  in  any  way  limits  the  rights  of  the  Firm  under  the  JPMorgan  Chase  Bonus
Recoupment Policy (or successor policy).

Recapture Provisions (Detrimental Conduct, Risk-Related and Other Recapture Provisions)

Notwithstanding any terms of this Award Agreement to the contrary, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel up to 100%
of your award (for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units as well as the Calculated PSUs) and,
to the extent set forth in “Remedies” below, to recover from you up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the vesting date)
of  the  gross  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  previously  distributed  (including  vested  shares  subject  to  the  Holding  Requirements  and  shares
withheld for tax purposes) under this award if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:

• you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm or its business activities,

or

this award was based on a material misrepresentation by you, or

with  respect  to  Disability,  you  must  satisfy  the  notice  and  documentation  described  above  and  receive  written  consent  to  such  continued
vesting, and
in all cases, otherwise complied with all other terms of the Award Agreement.  (See section captioned “Your Obligations” below.)

Death

If you die while you are eligible to vest in this award, your designated beneficiary on file with the Firm’s Stock Administration Department (or your
estate or if no beneficiary has been designated or survives you or if beneficiary designation is not recognized by local legislation) may be entitled to
receive a distribution of a number of shares of Common Stock associated with your award.  The Award Payout Percentage in the case of death is
based  on  the  Number  to  Vest  on  the  Vesting  Date  calculation  described  above  using  the  average  performance  of  all  completed  calendar  years,
multiplied  by  one-third  of  the  Target  Award  Number  of  PSUs  for  each  completed  calendar  year  in  the  Performance  Period,  and  using  the  Award
Payout Percentage equal to 100 percent for any remaining calendar years in the Performance Period.

In addition, your beneficiary or your estate shall receive additional shares of Common Stock, i.e. Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units, as set
forth in the section captioned, “Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units” but based on dividend equivalents up to the date of your death.

Any shares will be distributed no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year which contains your date of death;
however, our administrative practice is to register such shares in the name of your beneficiary or estate within 60 days of the Firm’s receipt of any
required documentation.

Your Obligations

In  consideration  of  the  grant  of  this  award,  you  agree  to  comply  with  and  be  bound  by  the  obligations  set  forth  below  next  to  the  subsections
captioned  “--Non-Solicitation  of  Employees  and  Customers”,  “--Confidential  Information”,  “--Non-Disparagement”,  ”--Cooperation”,  “--Compliance
with Award Agreement”, and “--Notice Period”.

• Non-Solicitation of Employees and Customers

During your employment by the Firm and for the longer of the (i) one year period following the termination of your employment or, (ii) if your
award is not cancelled as of your termination date, the three year period from Grant Date, you will not directly or indirectly, whether on your
own  behalf  or  on  behalf  of  any  other  party,  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Director  of  Human  Resources:  (i)  solicit,  induce  or
encourage any of the Firm’s then current employees to leave the Firm or to apply for employment elsewhere, unless such current employee has
received official, written notice that his or her employment will be terminated due to job elimination (ii) hire any employee or former employee
who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment terminated because his or her job

was  eliminated,  or  the  individual’s  employment  with  the  Firm  has  been  terminated  for  more  than  six  months,  (iii)  to  the  fullest  extent
enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business
with the Firm, any then current customers, suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to
you by virtue of your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, suppliers or
other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service after your employment with the Firm
without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information.

These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, such as employment
decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the Firm’s policies.

•

Confidential Information
You  will  not,  either  during  your  employment  with  the  Firm  or  thereafter,  directly  or  indirectly  (i)  use  or  disclose  to  anyone  any  confidential
information related to the Firm’s business, or (ii) communicate with the press or other media about matters related to the Firm, its customers
or employees, including matters and activities relating to your employment, or the employment of others, by the Firm, in the case of either (i)
or  (ii),  except  as  explicitly  permitted  by  the  JPMorgan  Chase  Code  of  Conduct  and  applicable  policies  or  law  or  legal  process.    In  addition,
following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private and internal information
through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  “Confidential information” shall have the same meaning for the Award Agreement as it has in
the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct.

Nothing  in  this  award  precludes  you  from  reporting  to  the  Firm’s  management  or  directors,  the  government,  a  regulator,  a  self-regulatory
agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct
violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a
court of law.

• Non-Disparagement

You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make or encourage others to make any public statement or release
any information in verbal, written, electronic or any other form, that is intended to, or reasonably could be foreseen to, disparage, embarrass
or criticize the Firm or its employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group.  This shall not preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s
management or directors or to the government or a regulator conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or the Firm’s Code of Conduct or
responding truthfully to questions or requests for information to the government, a regulator or in a court of law in connection with a legal or
regulatory investigation or proceeding.

Cooperation
You will cooperate fully with and provide full and accurate information to the Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter (including any
audit,  tax  proceeding,  litigation,  investigation  or  governmental  proceeding)  with  respect  to  which  you  may  have  knowledge  or  information,
subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you.

Compliance with Award Agreement
You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award Agreement, and you authorize
the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be affected thereby, including your prospective employer.

•

•

• Notice Period

If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or by policy, that requires
you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice Period”), then as consideration for this award
and  continued  employment,  you  will  provide  the  Firm  with  the  necessary  advance  written  notice  that  applies  to  you,  as  specified  by  such
contract or policy.

After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable Notice Period or may place you
on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty
to  the  Firm  by  providing  services  in  a  cooperative  and  professional  manner  and  not  perform  any  services  for  any  other  employer  and  shall
receive your base salary and certain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the
length of the Notice Period.

Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period described under the subsection
captioned “-- Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment under that same subsection.

Remedies

•

Cancellation

In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recapture
Provisions”  and  “Termination  of  Employment”,  your  outstanding  PSUs  under  this  award  may  be  cancelled  if  the  Firm  in  its  sole  discretion
determines that:

•

•
•

you  have  failed  to  comply  with  any  of  the  advance  notice/cooperation  requirements  or  employment  restrictions  applicable  to  your
termination of employment, or
you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “Release/Certification” by the specified deadline, or
you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”.

To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this
award  and/or  distribution  of  shares  under  this  award,  including,  without  limitation,  during  any  period  that  JPMorgan  Chase  is  evaluating
whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are
satisfied.    The  Firm  is  not  responsible  for  any  price  fluctuations  during  any  period  of  suspension  and,  if  applicable,  suspended  units  will  be
reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures.  See also “Administrative Provisions-No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.

• Recovery

In addition, you may be required to pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date
or acceleration date)  of the gross number of shares of Common  Stock previously distributed, including vested shares subject to the Holding
Requirements, under this award as follows:
• Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery

under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦ you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment;
◦ you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations;” or
◦ you  violated  the  employment  restrictions  set  forth  in  the  subsection  “Full  Career  Eligibility”  or  “Government  Office”  following  the

termination of your employment.

•

In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of-recovery under
this  section,  if  the  Firm  in  its  sole  discretion  determines  appropriate  pursuant  to  the  provisions  in  the  section  captioned  “Recapture
Provisions”.

Notice-of-recovery  under  this  subsection  is  a  written  (including  electronic)  notice  from  the  Firm  to  you  either  requiring  payment  under  this
subsection or stating  that  JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-
recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known
address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring
payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall
be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.

For  purposes  of  this  subsection,  shares  distributed  under  this  award  include  shares  withheld  for  tax  purposes.    However,  it  is  the  Firm’s
intention  that  you  only  be  required  to  pay  the  amounts  under  this  subsection  with  respect  to  shares  that  are  or  may  be  retained  by  you
following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax
withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including
as a tax credit, refund or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in
his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.

Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and
conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.

Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment”.

• Right to an Injunction

You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the
Firm,  and  therefore  agree  that  the  Firm  shall  be  entitled  as  a  matter  of  right  to  an  injunction,  from  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,
restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to
whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.

Administrative Provisions

Withholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of
shares  of  Common  Stock  required  to  satisfy  applicable  tax  obligations  or  (ii)  implement  any  other  desirable  or  necessary  procedures,  so  that
appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include
but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the
extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that
vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and vested shares
directly to the competent authorities.

Right to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your
Award  Agreement,  the  Firm  may,  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law  (including  Section  409A  of  the  Code  to  the  extent  it  is
applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe

to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any
funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt
or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized
in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.

No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of
Common  Stock  will  be  issued  to  you  until  after  the  number  of  PSUs  have  been  determined,  if  any,  and  have  vested.    Shares  will  be  issued  in
accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish
on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and
deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation
provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may
be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “Recapture Provisions”, “Termination of
Employment” and “Remedies”, as well as the subsection captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)

With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in
its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting
the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence
shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during
such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to
pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to
such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment”
and “Remedies”.)

Binding Agreement:  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.

Not  a  Contract  of  Employment:  Nothing  contained  in  the  Award  Agreement  constitutes  a  contract  of  employment  or  continued  employment.
Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time.  This award does not confer any right or
entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not
compensation for purposes of determining severance.

Section 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended
to  comply  with  Section  409A  of  the  Code,  and  the  Award  Agreement,  including  these  terms  and  conditions,  shall  be  interpreted  in  a  manner
consistent with such intent.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the
JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of
death)  and  if  any  units/shares  under  this  award  represent  deferred  compensation  as  defined  in  Section  409A  and  such  shares  are  distributable
(under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered
during  the  first  calendar  month  after    the  expiration  of  six  full  months  from  date  of  your  separation  from  service.    Further,  if  your  award  is  not
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year
immediately following the vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion of
the award.

Change in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split,
recapitalization,  issuance  of  a  new  class  of  common  stock,  merger,  consolidation,  spin-off,  combination  or  exchange  of  shares  or  other  similar
corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable
substitution  or  proportionate  adjustment,  in  the  number  or  kind  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  other  securities  issued  or  reserved  for  issuance
pursuant to the Plan and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.

Other  Equitable  Adjustments:  The  Committee  may  make  adjustments  (up  or  down)  to  the  award  as  it  deems  to  be  equitable,  to  maintain  the
intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Firm (or the
Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in
capital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as the Committee may deem appropriate.

Interpretation/Administration:    The  Committee  has  sole  and  complete  authority  to  interpret  and  administer  this  Award  Agreement,  including,
without  limitation,  the  power  to  (i)  interpret  the  Plan  and  the  terms  of  this  Award  Agreement;  (ii)  determine  the  reason  for  termination  of
employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising
with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee,
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.

Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the  contrary,  the  determinations  of  the  Director  of  Human  Resources,  the  Firm,  the  Committee  and  their
respective  delegates  and  nominees  under  the  Plan  and  the  Award  Agreements  are  not  required  to  be  uniform.    By  way  of  clarification,  the
Committee,  the  Firm,  the  Director  of  Human  Resources  and  their  respective  delegates  and  nominees  shall  be  entitled  to  make  non-uniform  and
selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.

Amendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason;
provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except

to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable
laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y) make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions
described  above  under  “No  Ownership  Rights/Other  Limitations”,  in  either  case,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  Section  409A  of  the  Code  if  it  is
applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase.

Severability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of
competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area
or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.

Accelerated  Distribution  for  Ethics  or  Conflict  Reasons  Resulting  From  Employment  by  a  Government  Entity:    Upon  receipt  of  satisfactory
evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to
divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award, including Reinvested
Dividend  Equivalent  Share  Units,  effective  on  or  before  the  required  divestiture  date  and  waive  the  Holding  Requirement;  provided  that  no
accelerated  distribution  shall  occur  if  the  Firm  determines  that  such  acceleration  will  violate  Section  409A  of  the  Code.  Accelerated  distribution
under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the “Recovery” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by
the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any acceleration event.

If  you  have  voluntarily  terminated  your  employment  and  have  satisfied  the  requirements  of  the  section  captioned  “Government  Office
Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that
section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full
Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.  Subject to the two foregoing sections, the
number of shares of Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section captioned
“Death”.

To the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to divestiture requirement as forth
herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.

Notwithstanding  an  accelerated  distribution  or  waiver  of  the  Holding  Requirement  pursuant  to  the  foregoing,  you  will  remain  subject  to  the
applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period and shares had
been  distributed  as  scheduled  as  of  the  vesting  date,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  repayment  obligations  set  forth  in  the  section  captioned
“Remedies” and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the
subsection “Full Career Eligibility”.

Use of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you
this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as
service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree
that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect
to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be
cancelled.

Governing Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of
law principles.

Choice of Forum:  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under
an  arbitration  agreement  between  you  and  the  Firm,  any  dispute  arising  directly  or  indirectly  in  connection  with  this  award  or  the  Plan  shall  be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the
event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence
any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.

Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:  By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with
the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual
basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class
action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.

Litigation:    By  accepting  any  award  under  the  Plan,  you  agree  (and  have  agreed)  that  in  any  action  or  proceeding  by  the  Firm  (other  than  a
derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm
is  the  prevailing  party,  the  Firm  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  from  you  its  reasonable  attorney  fees  and  expenses  incurred  in  such  action  or
proceeding.  In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the
Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm.

Non-transferability:  Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance based share units, nor your
interests  or  rights  in  any  such  awards,  shall  be  assigned,  pledged,  transferred,  hedged,  hypothecated  or  subject  to  any  lien.    An  award  may  be
transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.

Definitions

“Average  Tangible  Common  Equity”  means  annual  average  common  stockholders’  equity  less  annual  average  goodwill  and  annual  average

performance for the Performance Period (both percentage and ranking, as set forth in the footnote to the Performance Table); provided that if the
average of the Firm’s Reported ROTCE for the Performance Period either equals or exceeds ______% or is less than ______% (without taking into account
any rounding conventions used), _________ percent or ________, respectively as the case may be, shall be substituted for the Performance Period’s Award
Payout  Percentage  in  calculating  the  number  of  PSUs  to  distribute.  For  avoidance  of  doubt,  any  cancellation  of  this  award  (in  whole  or  in  part)

Government Office Requirements

You may be eligible to continue vesting in all or part of your award if you voluntarily resign to accept a Government Office (as defined above) or to
become a candidate for an elective Government Office.

Full Career Eligibility:
“Government Office Requirements” does not apply to you if you satisfy the subsection captioned “--Full Career Eligibility” as of the date that you
voluntarily terminate your employment with the Firm.

Eligibility:
Eligibility for continued vesting is conditioned on your providing the Firm:

• At  least  60  days’  advance  written  notice  of  your  intention  to  resign  to  accept  or  pursue  a  Government  Office  (see  section  captioned
“Definitions”), during which period you must perform in a cooperative and professional manner services requested by the Firm and not provide
services for any other employer.  The Firm may elect to shorten this notice period at the Firm’s sole discretion.

• Confirmation,  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  the  Firm,  that  vesting  in  this  award  pursuant  to  this  provision  would  not  violate  any  applicable  law,

regulation or rule.

• Documentation  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  the  Firm  that  your  resignation  is  for  the  purpose  of  accepting  a  Government  Office  or  becoming  a

candidate for a Government Office.  (See section captioned “Definitions”.)

Portion of Your Award Subject to Continued Vesting:
Subject  to  the  conditions  below,  the  percentage  of  this  award  that  will  continue  to  vest  in  accordance  with  this  award’s  original  schedule  will  be
based on your years of continuous service completed with the Firm immediately preceding your termination date, as follows:

• 50% if you have at least 3 but less than 4 years of continuous service,
• 75% if you have at least 4 but less than 5 years of continuous service, or
• 100% if you have 5 or more years of continuous service.

The portion of this award subject to continued vesting above is referred to as the “CV Award” and the portion not subject to continued vesting will be
cancelled as of the date your employment terminates.

Conditions for Continued Vesting of Award:
• You must remain in a non-elective Government Office for two or more years after your employment with the Firm terminates to be eligible to
receive the CV Award; provided that if your non-elective Government Office is for a period less than two years, you will be eligible to receive the
CV Award if it has a vesting date during your period of Government Service; or
In the case of resignation from the Firm to campaign for an elective Government Office, your name must be on the primary or final public ballot
for the election. (If you are not elected, see below for employment restrictions.)

•

For  avoidance  of  doubt,  the  performance  criteria  and  protection  based  vesting  set  forth  in  these  terms  and  conditions  continue  to  apply  to  a  CV
Award.

Satisfaction of Conditions:
If your service in a Government Office ends two years or more after your employment with the Firm terminates, or in the case of resignation from
the Firm to campaign for a Government Office, your name is on the primary or final public ballot for the election and you are not elected, any CV
Awards then outstanding and any such awards that would have then been outstanding but for an accelerated distribution of shares (as described in
the  subsection  captioned  “--Accelerated  Distribution  for  Ethics  or  Conflict  Reasons  Resulting  From  Employment  by  a  Government  Entity”)  will  be
subject  for  the  remainder  of  the  applicable  vesting  period  to  the  same  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Award  Agreement,  including  employment
restrictions during the vesting period, as if you had resigned from the Firm having met the  requirements for Full Career Eligibility.

Failure to Satisfy Conditions:
If you do not satisfy the above “Conditions for Continued Vesting of Awards”, any outstanding PSUs under the CV Award will be cancelled. You also
will be required to repay the Fair Market Value of the number of shares (before tax and other withholdings) of Common Stock distributed to you that
would have been outstanding as PSUs on the date you failed to satisfy the “Conditions for Continued Vesting of Award” but for their accelerated
distribution  (as  described  in  subsection  captioned,  “Accelerated  Distribution  for  Ethics  or  Conflict  Reasons  Resulting  From  Employment  by  a
Government Entity”). Fair Market Value for this purpose will be determined as the date that the shares were distributed.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF _________________, 20____
PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARD
OPERATING COMMITTEE
 (Protection-Based Vesting Provisions)

Award Agreement

These terms and conditions are made part of the Award Agreement dated as of ___________________, 20____ (“Grant Date”) awarding performance share
units  (“PSUs”)  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  JPMorgan  Chase  &  Co.  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  (“Plan”).  To  the  extent  the  terms  of  the  Award
Agreement (all references to which will include these terms and conditions) conflict with the Plan, the Plan will govern.  The Award Agreement, the
Plan and Prospectus supersede any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been entered into by the Firm and you relating to this
award.

This  award  was  granted  on  the  Grant  Date  subject  to  the  Award  Agreement  and  Plan.    Unless  you  decline  by  the  deadline  and  in  the  manner
specified in the Award Agreement, you will have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions, effective as of the Grant Date.  If you decline
the award, it will be cancelled as of the Grant Date.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in “Definitions” below or elsewhere in the Award Agreement will have the same meaning as set forth in the
Plan.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. will be referred to throughout the Award Agreement as “JPMorgan Chase”, and together with its subsidiaries as the “Firm”.

Form and Purpose of Award

Each  PSU  represents  a  non-transferable  right  to  receive  one  share  of  Common  Stock  following  each  vesting  date  as  set  forth  in  your  Award
Agreement.

The  purpose  of  this  award  is  to  further  emphasize  sustained  long-term  performance  and  to  align  your  interests  with  those  of  the  Firm  and  its
shareholders.

Protection-Based Vesting

This award is intended and expected to vest on each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement, provided that you are continuously employed
by the Firm through such vesting date, or you meet the requirements for continued vesting described under the subsections “--Job Elimination”, “--
Full Career Eligibility”, “--Government Office” or “--Disability”.  However, vesting and the number of PSUs that will vest are subject to these terms
and conditions (including, but not limited to, sections captioned “Number of Performance Share Units at the end of Performance Period”, “Capital
Ratio Performance Threshold”, “Recapture Provisions”, “Remedies” and the following protection-based vesting provision).

Up to a total of fifty percent of your award that would otherwise be distributable to you as of any vesting date (“At Risk PSUs”) may be cancelled if
the Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase (“CEO”) determines in his or her sole discretion that cancellation of all or portion of the At Risk PSUs is
appropriate in light of any one or a combination of the following factors:

• Your  performance  in  relation  to  the  priorities  for  your  position,  or  the  Firm’s  performance  in  relation  to  the  priorities  for  which  you  share
responsibility as a member of the Operating Committee, have been unsatisfactory for a sustained period of time.  Among the factors the CEO may
consider  in  assessing  performance  are:  net  income,  total  net  revenue,  earnings  per  share  and  capital  ratios  of  the  Firm,  both  on  an  absolute
basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.

• For any calendar year ending during the vesting period, JPMorgan Chase’s annual pre-tax pre-provision income at the Firm level is negative.
• RSU  awards  granted  to  participants  in  a  Line  of  Business  for  which  you  exercise,  or  during  the  vesting  period  exercised,  direct  or  indirect
responsibility, were in whole or in part cancelled because the Line of Business did not meet its annual Line of Business Financial Threshold.

• The Firm does not meet the Firmwide Financial Threshold.

For avoidance of doubt, cancellation of the At Risk PSUs, in whole or part, for one or more of the above factors may occur prior to the end of the
Performance Period and the maximum number of At Risk PSUs subject to cancellation prior to the end of the Performance Period will be up to fifty
percent of the Target Award Number.

In the event that your employment terminates due to “Job Elimination”, ”Full Career Eligibility”, “Government Office” or “Disability” thereby entitling
you to continued vesting in your award, (or potentially acceleration due to satisfaction of the Government Office Requirements), the cancellation
circumstances described above will continue to apply.

Any  determination  above  with  respect  to  protection-based  vesting  provisions  is  subject  to  ratification  by  the  Compensation  and  Management
Development Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (“Committee”).  In the case of an award to any current or former CEO, all such
determinations shall be made by the Committee and ratified by the Board.

Number of Performance Share Units at End of Performance Period

Subject to any cancellation in whole or part of your award pursuant to these terms and conditions:

Performance calculation:  The number of PSUs at the end of the Performance Period will be derived by multiplying the Target Award Number by the
Award Payout Percentage determined using the Performance Table.

The number of PSUs determined above will be subject to the Qualitative Performance Factor (as detailed below), which if the Committee determines
that such an adjustment is appropriate, will be applied following the end of each year during the Performance Period, to adjust downward one-third
of the Target Award Number of PSUs for each calendar year in the Performance Period.  Additionally, the Committee, in its discretion, may make a
qualitative performance assessment based on the entire three year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire
number of PSUs determined above.

See sections captioned “Calculation of Performance Ranking” and “Definitions”.

Delivery  of  vested  shares  of  common  stock  to  your  account  will  be  made  not  later  than  the  date  specified  in  the  last  sentence  of  the  subsection
captioned “Section 409A Compliance”.

Reinvested Dividend Equivalent Share Units

This award is not eligible for reinvested dividend equivalent share units.

Holding Requirement

The net number of shares of Common Stock (after tax and all other lawful withholdings) in which you have vested, if any, as of the vesting date will
be  held  in  an  account  in  your  name  with  restrictions  preventing  you  from  transferring,  assigning,  hedging,  selling,  pledging  or  otherwise
encumbering  such  shares  for  (i)  a  twelve  month  period  measured  from  each  vesting  date;  and  (ii)  a  two  year  period  for  such  shares  vesting  on
____________,  20____,  with  the  holding  periods  running  concurrently.    Such  restrictions  shall  only  lapse,  prior  to  the  expiration  of  the  two  year  holding
period, in the event of your death or for an accelerated distribution for ethics or conflict reasons.  See section captioned, “Death” and subsection
captioned, “Accelerated Distribution for Ethics or Conflict Reasons Resulting from Employment by a Government Entity”.

Calculation of Performance Ranking

For  purposes  of  the  Performance  Ranking,  the  ranking  of  the  Firm  and  of  each  Performance  Company  for  the  Performance  Period  shall  be
determined  and  calculated  by  the  Calculation  Agent,  using  the  definitions  of  “Average  Tangible  Common  Equity”  (if  otherwise  applicable),
“Calculated  PSUs”,  “Firm  Reported  ROTCE”,  “Performance  Table”  (including  its  footnote)  and  “ROTCE”  as  set  forth  in  the  “Definitions”  section  of
these terms and conditions.  See section captioned “Definitions”.  Except for Firm Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the
second place (i.e. xx.yy%), rounded to the nearest hundredth.  See section captioned, “Definitions--Performance Table” in the event of a tie.  All
performance based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.

Capital Ratio Performance Threshold

Unvested  PSUs  are  subject  to  reduction  if  the  Firm’s  Common  Equity  Tier  1  (CET1)  capital  ratio  at  any  year  end  falls  below  a  predetermined
threshold of _______%.

If the Firm’s CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to one-third of the Target
Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year.

Qualitative Performance

Determination  of  Qualitative  Performance  Factor.    Annually  during  the  Performance  Period,  the  Committee  will  formally  assess  your  qualitative
performance based on four broad categories: (1) Client/Customer Focus; (2) Risk, Controls & Conduct; (3) Teamwork & Leadership; and (4) Business
Results.  If  the  Committee  determines  that  your  performance  “Meets”  expectations,  no  downward  adjustment  to  one-third  of  the  Target  Award
Number  of  PSUs  for  that  year  shall  take  place  (and  the  Qualitative  Performance  Factor  shall  be  100%).  If  the  Committee  determines  that  your
performance did “Not Meet” expectations, the Committee shall determine whether a downward adjustment is appropriate, and if so, to what extent.
A downward adjustment could result in a Qualitative Performance Factor of between 0% and 99%, depending on the circumstances.  During the
Performance Period, a 0% Performance Factor for each year in the Performance Period would reduce your Target Award Number of PSUs to zero,
resulting in the cancellation of award with no shares vesting.

Additionally, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such assessment of your qualitative performance based on your performance during
the entire three year Performance Period and apply the Qualitative Performance Factor to the entire number of PSUs determined  under  section
captioned  “Number  of  Performance  Share  Units  at  End  of  the  Performance  Period”.    In  the  case  of  a  Qualitative  Performance  Factor  of  0%,  the
award would be cancelled.

The assessment will have regard to feedback solicited from the Chair of the UK Remuneration Committee to incorporate qualitative performance
against local regulatory responsibilities as a “Senior Manager” of the relevant CIB UK-regulated entities.

The  Qualitative  Performance  Factor  shall  only  be  applied,  if  applicable,  in  respect  of  a  period  of  your  employment  with  the  Firm,  or  as  soon  as
administratively practical.

Bonus Recoupment

In consideration of the grant of this award, you agree that you are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy (or successor policy) as

this award which ensure that the Firm is able to meet its regulatory obligations to operate malus (reduce) and/or clawback (recover) to awards in
certain circumstances.  These include, but are not limited to, where (i) there is a material downturn in the Firm’s financial performance or (ii) where
the Firm is required to hold more capital. The circumstances in which the events at (i) and (ii) would occur are analogous to some of the
circumstances considered under the existing Firmwide terms and conditions, in particular the Bonus Recoupment Policy and the Protection Based
Vesting provisions.

Notwithstanding any terms of this Award Agreement to the contrary, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel up to 100%
of your award and, to the extent set forth in “Remedies” below, to recover from you up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as
of  any  vesting  date)  of  the  gross  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  previously  distributed  (including  vested  shares  subject  to  the  Holding
Requirements and shares withheld for tax or other lawful purposes) under this award if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:

• you engaged in conduct detrimental to the Firm insofar as it causes material financial or reputational harm to the Firm or its business activities,

who was employed by the Firm at the date your employment terminated, unless the individual’s employment terminated because his or her job
was  eliminated,  or  the  individual’s  employment  with  the  Firm  has  been  terminated  for  more  than  six  months,  (iii)  to  the  fullest  extent
enforceable under applicable law, solicit or induce or attempt to induce to leave the Firm, or divert or attempt to divert from doing business
with the Firm, any then current customers, suppliers or other persons or entities that were serviced by you or whose names became known to
you by virtue of your employment with the Firm, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between the Firm and such customers, suppliers or
other persons or entities.  This does not apply to publicly known institutional customers that you service after your employment with the Firm
without the use of the Firm’s confidential or proprietary information.

These restrictions do not apply to authorized actions you take in the normal course of your employment with the Firm, such as employment
decisions with respect to employees you supervise or business referrals in accordance with the Firm’s policies.

•

Confidential Information
You  will  not,  either  during  your  employment  with  the  Firm  or  thereafter,  directly  or  indirectly  (i)  use  or  disclose  to  anyone  any  confidential
information related to the Firm’s business, or (ii) communicate with the press or other media about matters related to the Firm, its customers
or employees, including matters and activities relating to your employment, or the employment of others, by the Firm, in the case of either (i)
or  (ii),  except  as  explicitly  permitted  by  the  JPMorgan  Chase  Code  of  Conduct  and  applicable  policies  or  law  or  legal  process.    In  addition,
following your termination of employment, you will not, without prior written authorization, access the Firm’s private and internal information
through telephonic, intranet or internet means.  “Confidential information” shall have the same meaning for the Award Agreement as it has in
the JPMorgan Chase Code of Conduct.

Nothing  in  this  award  precludes  you  from  reporting  to  the  Firm’s  management  or  directors,  the  government,  a  regulator,  a  self-regulatory
agency, your attorneys or a court, conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or concerns of any known or suspected Code of Conduct
violation.  It is also not intended to prevent you from responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a regulator or in a
court of law.

• Non-Disparagement

You will not, either during your employment with the Firm or thereafter, make or encourage others to make any public statement or release
any information in verbal, written, electronic or any other form, that is intended to, or reasonably could be foreseen to, disparage, embarrass
or criticize the Firm or its employees, officers, directors or shareholders as a group.  This shall not preclude you from reporting to the Firm’s
management or directors or to the government or a regulator conduct you believe to be in violation of the law or the Firm’s Code of Conduct or
responding truthfully to questions or requests for information to the government, a regulator or in a court of law in connection with a legal or
regulatory investigation or proceeding.

•

Cooperation
You will cooperate fully with and provide full and accurate information to the Firm and its counsel with respect to any matter (including any
audit,  tax  proceeding,  litigation,  investigation  or  governmental  proceeding)  with  respect  to  which  you  may  have  knowledge  or  information,
subject to reimbursement for actual, appropriate and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you.

•

Compliance with Award Agreement
You will provide the Firm with any information reasonably requested to determine compliance with the Award Agreement, and you authorize
the Firm to disclose the terms of the Award Agreement to any third party who might be affected thereby, including your prospective employer.

• Notice Period

If you are subject to a notice period or become subject to a notice period after the Grant Date, whether by contract or by policy, that requires
you to provide advance written notice of your intention to terminate your employment (“Notice Period”), then as consideration for this award
and  continued  employment,  you  will  provide  the  Firm  with  the  necessary  advance  written  notice  that  applies  to  you,  as  specified  by  such
contract or policy.

After receipt of your notice, the Firm may choose to have you continue to provide services during the applicable Notice Period or may place you
on a paid leave for all or part of the applicable Notice Period.  During the Notice Period, you shall continue to devote your full time and loyalty
to  the  Firm  by  providing  services  in  a  cooperative  and  professional  manner  and  not  perform  any  services  for  any  other  employer  and  shall
receive your base salary and certain benefits until your employment terminates.  You and the Firm may mutually agree to waive or modify the
length of the Notice Period.

Regardless of whether a Notice Period applies to you, you must comply with the 180-day advance notice period described under the subsection
captioned “-- Full Career Eligibility” in the event you wish to terminate employment under that same subsection.

Remedies

•

Cancellation

In addition to the cancellation provisions described under the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Qualitative Performance Factor”,
“Bonus  Recoupment”,  “EMEA  Malus  and  Clawback  Policy  -  Identified  Staff”,  “Recapture  Provisions”  and  “Termination  of  Employment”,  your
outstanding PSUs under this award may be cancelled if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:

•

•
•

you  have  failed  to  comply  with  any  of  the  advance  notice/cooperation  requirements  or  employment  restrictions  applicable  to  your
termination of employment, or
you have failed to return the required forms specified under the section captioned “Release/Certification” by the specified deadline, or
you have violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations”.

To the extent provided under the subsection captioned “--Amendment” below, JPMorgan Chase reserves the right to suspend vesting of this
award  and/or  distribution  of  shares  under  this  award,  including,  without  limitation,  during  any  period  that  JPMorgan  Chase  is  evaluating
whether this award is subject to cancellation and/or recovery and/or whether the conditions for distributions of shares under this award are
satisfied.    The  Firm  is  not  responsible  for  any  price  fluctuations  during  any  period  of  suspension  and,  if  applicable,  suspended  units  will  be
reinstated consistent with Plan administration procedures.  See also “Administrative Provisions-No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations”.

• Recovery

In  addition  to  cancellation  of  outstanding  PSUs,  you  may  be  required  to  pay  the  Firm  up  to  an  amount  equal  to  the  Fair  Market  Value
(determined  as  of  the  applicable  vesting  date  or  acceleration  date)  of  the  gross  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  previously  distributed,
including vested shares subject to the Holding Requirements, under this award as follows:
• Payment may be required with respect to any shares of Common Stock distributed within the three year period prior to a notice-of-recovery

under this section, if the Firm in its sole discretion determines that:
◦ you committed a fraudulent act, or engaged in knowing and willful misconduct related to your employment;
◦ you violated any of the provisions as set forth above in the section captioned “Your Obligations;”  or
◦ you  violated  the  employment  restrictions  set  forth  in  the  subsection  “Full  Career  Eligibility”  or  “Government  Office”  following  the

termination of your employment.

•

In addition, payment may be required with respect to any shares distributed within the one year period prior to notice-of-recovery under
this  section,  if  the  Firm  in  its  sole  discretion  determines  appropriate  pursuant  to  the  provisions  in  the  section  captioned  “Recapture
Provisions”.

Notice-of-recovery  under  this  subsection  is  a  written  (including  electronic)  notice  from  the  Firm  to  you  either  requiring  payment  under  this
subsection or stating  that  JPMorgan Chase is evaluating requiring payment under this subsection.  Without limiting the foregoing, notice-of-
recovery will be deemed provided if the Firm makes a good faith attempt to provide written (including electronic) notice at your last known
address maintained in the Firm’s employment records.  For the avoidance of doubt, a notice-of-recovery that the Firm is evaluating requiring
payment under this subsection shall preserve JPMorgan Chase’s rights to require payment as set forth above in all respects and the Firm shall
be under no obligation to complete its evaluation other than as the Firm may determine in its sole discretion.

For  purposes  of  this  subsection,  shares  distributed  under  this  award  include  shares  withheld  for  tax  purposes.    However,  it  is  the  Firm’s
intention  that  you  only  be  required  to  pay  the  amounts  under  this  subsection  with  respect  to  shares  that  are  or  may  be  retained  by  you
following a determination of tax liability and that you will not be required to pay amounts with respect to shares representing irrevocable tax

withholdings or tax payments previously made (whether by you or the Firm) that you will not be able to recover, recapture or reclaim (including
as a tax credit, refund or other benefit).  Accordingly, JPMorgan Chase will not require you to pay any amount that the Firm or its nominee in
his or her sole discretion determines is represented by such withholdings or tax payments.

Payment may be made in shares of Common Stock or in cash.  You agree that any repayment will be a lawful recovery under the terms and
conditions of your Award Agreement and is not to be construed in any manner as a penalty.

Nothing in the section in any way limits your obligations under “Bonus Recoupment” and “EMEA Malus and Clawback Policy - Identified Staff”.

• Right to an Injunction

You acknowledge that a violation or attempted violation of the obligations set forth herein will cause immediate and irreparable damage to the
Firm,  and  therefore  agree  that  the  Firm  shall  be  entitled  as  a  matter  of  right  to  an  injunction,  from  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,
restraining any violation or further violation of such obligations; such right to an injunction, however, shall be cumulative and in addition to
whatever other remedies the Firm may have under law or equity.

Administrative Provisions

Withholding Taxes:  As a result of legal and/or tax obligations the Firm, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain from each distribution the number of
shares  of  Common  Stock  required  to  satisfy  applicable  tax  obligations  or  (ii)  implement  any  other  desirable  or  necessary  procedures,  so  that
appropriate withholding and other taxes are paid to the competent authorities with respect to the vested shares and the award.  This may include
but is not limited to (i) a market sale of a number of such shares on your behalf substantially equal to the withholding or other taxes, (ii) to the
extent required by law, withhold from cash compensation, an amount equal to any withholding obligation with respect to the award and shares that
vest under this award, and (iii) retaining shares that vest under this award until you pay any taxes associated with the award and vested shares
directly to the competent authorities.

Right to Set Off:  Although the Firm expects to settle this award in share(s) of Common Stock as of the applicable vesting date, as set forth in your
Award  Agreement,  the  Firm  may,  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law  (including  Section  409A  of  the  Code  to  the  extent  it  is
applicable to you), retain for itself funds or the Common Stock resulting from any vesting of this award to satisfy any obligation or debt that you owe
to the Firm. Notwithstanding any account agreement with the Firm to the contrary, the Firm will not recoup or recover any amount owed from any
funds or unrestricted securities held in your name and maintained at the Firm pursuant to such account agreement to satisfy any obligation or debt
or obligation owed by you under this award without your consent.  This restriction on the Firm does not apply to accounts described and authorized
in “No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations” described below.

No Ownership Rights/Other Limitations:  PSUs do not convey the rights of ownership of Common Stock and do not carry voting rights.  No shares of
Common  Stock  will  be  issued  to  you  until  after  the  number  of  PSUs  have  been  determined,  if  any,  and  have  vested.    Shares  will  be  issued  in
accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s procedures for issuing stock.  By accepting this award, you authorize the Firm, in its sole discretion, to establish
on your behalf a brokerage account in your name with the Firm or book-entry account with our stock plan administrator and/or transfer agent and
deliver to that account any vested shares derived from the award.  You also acknowledge that should there be a determination that the cancellation
provisions of this award apply during the period when the vesting of any outstanding PSUs has been suspended, then you agree that such PSUs may
be cancelled in whole or part. (See Sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting”, “Qualitative Performance Factor”, “Bonus Recoupment”, “EMEA
Malus  &  Clawback  Policy  -  Identified  Staff”,  “Recapture  Provisions”,  “Termination  of  Employment”  and  “Remedies”,  as  well  as  the  subsection
captioned “--Amendment” permitting suspension of vesting.)

With respect to any applicable vesting date, JPMorgan Chase may impose for any reason, as of such vesting date for such period as it may specify in
its sole discretion, such restrictions on the Common Stock to be issued to you as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, restricting
the sale, transfer, pledging, assignment, hedging or encumbrance of such shares of Common Stock. Such restrictions described in the last sentence
shall not impact your right to vote or receive dividends with respect to the Common Stock.  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that during
such specified period should there be a determination that the recovery provisions of this award apply, then you agree that you may be required to
pay the Firm up to an amount equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the applicable vesting date) of the gross number of shares subject to
such restrictions (notwithstanding the limitation set forth in the “Right to Set Off” subsection above).  (See sections captioned “Bonus Recoupment”
and “Remedies”.)

Binding Agreement:  The Award Agreement will be binding upon any successor in interest to JPMorgan Chase, by merger or otherwise.

Not  a  Contract  of  Employment:  Nothing  contained  in  the  Award  Agreement  constitutes  a  contract  of  employment  or  continued  employment.
Employment is “at-will” and may be terminated by either you or JPMorgan Chase for any reason at any time.  This award does not confer any right or
entitlement to, nor does the award impose any obligation on the Firm to provide, the same or any similar award in the future and its value is not
compensation for purposes of determining severance.

Section 409A Compliance:  To the extent that Section 409A of the Code is applicable to this award, distributions of shares hereunder are intended
to  comply  with  Section  409A  of  the  Code,  and  the  Award  Agreement,  including  these  terms  and  conditions,  shall  be  interpreted  in  a  manner
consistent with such intent.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if you (i) are subject to taxation under the Code, (ii) are a specified employee as defined in the
JPMorgan Chase 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) have incurred a separation from service (as defined in that Plan with the exception of

death)  and  if  any  units/shares  under  this  award  represent  deferred  compensation  as  defined  in  Section  409A  and  such  shares  are  distributable
(under the terms of this award) within six months following, and as a result of your separation from service, then those shares will be delivered
during  the  first  calendar  month  after    the  expiration  of  six  full  months  from  date  of  your  separation  from  service.    Further,  if  your  award  is  not
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code, then the remainder of each calendar year
immediately following each vesting date set forth in your Award Agreement shall be a payment date for purposes of distributing the vested portion
of the award.

Change in Outstanding Shares:  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or split,
recapitalization,  issuance  of  a  new  class  of  common  stock,  merger,  consolidation,  spin-off,  combination  or  exchange  of  shares  or  other  similar
corporate change, or any distributions to stockholders of Common Stock other than regular cash dividends, the Committee will make an equitable
substitution  or  proportionate  adjustment,  in  the  number  or  kind  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  other  securities  issued  or  reserved  for  issuance
pursuant to the Plan and to any PSUs outstanding under this award for such corporate events.

Other Equitable Adjustments: Except for the “Qualitative Performance Factor”, the Committee may make adjustments (up or down) to the award as
it deems to be equitable, to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances, which may include unusual or non-
recurring events affecting the Firm (or the Performance Companies) or its financial statements in each case resulting from changes in accounting
methods, practices or policies, changes in capital structure by reason of legal or regulatory requirements and such other changed circumstances, as
the Committee may deem appropriate.

Interpretation/Administration:    The  Committee  has  sole  and  complete  authority  to  interpret  and  administer  this  Award  Agreement,  including,
without  limitation,  the  power  to  (i)  interpret  the  Plan  and  the  terms  of  this  Award  Agreement;  (ii)  determine  the  reason  for  termination  of
employment; (iii) determine application of the post-employment obligations and cancellation and recovery provisions; (iv) decide all claims arising
with respect to this award; and (v) delegate such authority as it deems appropriate.  Any determination contemplated hereunder by the Committee,
the Firm, the Director of Human Resources or their respective delegates or nominees shall be binding on all parties.

Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the  contrary,  the  determinations  of  the  Director  of  Human  Resources,  the  Firm,  the  Committee  and  their
respective  delegates  and  nominees  under  the  Plan  and  the  Award  Agreements  are  not  required  to  be  uniform.    By  way  of  clarification,  the
Committee,  the  Firm,  the  Director  of  Human  Resources  and  their  respective  delegates  and  nominees  shall  be  entitled  to  make  non-uniform  and
selective determinations and modifications under Award Agreements and the Plan.

Amendment:  The Committee or its nominee reserves the right to amend this Award Agreement in any manner, at any time and for any reason;
provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially adversely affect your rights under this Award Agreement without your consent except
to the extent that the Committee or its delegate considers advisable to (x) comply with applicable laws or changes in or interpretation of applicable
laws, regulatory requirements and accounting rules or standards and/or (y) make a change in a scheduled vesting date or impose the restrictions
described  above  under  “No  Ownership  Rights/Other  Limitations”,  in  either  case,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  Section  409A  of  the  Code  if  it  is
applicable to you.  This Award Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by the Director of Human Resources of JPMorgan Chase.

Severability: If any portion of the Award Agreement is determined by the Firm to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or arbitrator of
competent jurisdiction or the Director of Human Resources may reform the relevant provisions (e.g., as to length of service, time, geographical area
or scope) to the extent the Firm (or court/arbitrator) considers necessary to make the provision enforceable under applicable law.

Accelerated  Distribution  for  Ethics  or  Conflict  Reasons  Resulting  From  Employment  by  a  Government  Entity:    Upon  receipt  of  satisfactory
evidence that applicable United States federal, state, local, foreign or supranational ethics or conflict of interest laws or regulations require you to
divest your interest in JPMorgan Chase PSUs, the Firm may accelerate the distribution of all or part of your outstanding award effective on or before
the required divestiture date and waive the Holding Requirement; provided that no accelerated distribution shall occur if the Firm determines that
such acceleration will violate Section 409A of the Code. Accelerated distribution under this paragraph does not impact the dates as set forth in the
“Recovery” section above.  The time period for recovery shall be determined by the originally scheduled vesting date or distribution date prior to any
acceleration event.

If  you  have  voluntarily  terminated  your  employment  and  have  satisfied  the  requirements  of  the  section  captioned  “Government  Office
Requirements”, acceleration shall apply (to extent required) to the percentage of your outstanding award that would continue to vest under that
section. In the case of a termination of employment where the award is outstanding as a result of the subsections entitled “Job Elimination” or “Full
Career Eligibility”, then acceleration shall apply, to the extent required, to the full outstanding award.  Subject to the two foregoing sections, the
number of shares of Common Stock to be received on acceleration shall be determined using the methodology set forth under the section captioned
“Death”.

To the extent you have vested shares under this award subject to the Holding Requirement and become subject to divestiture requirement as forth
herein, the Firm may waive the holding period to the extent required.

Notwithstanding  an  accelerated  distribution  or  waiver  of  the  Holding  Requirement  pursuant  to  the  foregoing,  you  will  remain  subject  to  the
applicable terms of your Award Agreement as if your award had remained outstanding for the duration of the vesting period and shares had been
distributed as scheduled as of each vesting date, including, but not limited to, repayment obligations set forth in the section captioned “Remedies”
and the employment restrictions in the sections captioned “Protection-Based Vesting” and “Government Office Requirements” and the subsection
“Full Career Eligibility”.

Use of Personal Data:  By accepting this award, you acknowledge that the Firm may process your personal data for the purposes of providing you
this award (to include registration of shares and units or establishing a brokerage account on your behalf) and disclosing to third parties, such as

service providers or tax and regulatory authorities (e.g., for compensation reporting and payroll tax withholding purposes).   Additionally, you agree
that the Firm may transfer your personal data to jurisdictions that do not afford protections equivalent to the protections in the country in which we
collected your data. Where applicable law provides a right to terminate the foregoing authorization, you may do so at any time, except with respect
to tax and regulatory reporting and the Firm’s legal and regulatory obligations.  In the event you terminate this authorization, your award will be
cancelled.

Governing Law: This award shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of
law principles.

Choice of Forum:  By accepting this award under the Plan, you agree (and have agreed) that to the extent not otherwise subject to arbitration under
an  arbitration  agreement  between  you  and  the  Firm,  any  dispute  arising  directly  or  indirectly  in  connection  with  this  award  or  the  Plan  shall  be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association if so elected by the Firm in its sole discretion.  In the
event such a dispute is not subject to arbitration for any reason, you agree to accept the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York with respect to any judicial proceeding in connection with this award or the Plan.  You waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of such dispute and further agree not to commence
any action arising out of or relating to this award or the Plan in any other forum.

Waiver of Jury Trial/Class Claims:  By accepting this award, you agree, with respect to any claim brought in connection with your employment with
the Firm in any forum (i) to waive the right to a jury trial and (ii) that any judicial proceeding or arbitration claim will be brought on an individual
basis, and you hereby waive any right to submit, initiate, or participate in a representative capacity or as a plaintiff, claimant or member in a class
action, collective action, or other representative or joint action.

Litigation:    By  accepting  any  award  under  the  Plan,  you  agree  (and  have  agreed)  that  in  any  action  or  proceeding  by  the  Firm  (other  than  a
derivative suit in the right of the Firm) to enforce the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement or any other Award Agreement where the Firm
is  the  prevailing  party,  the  Firm  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  from  you  its  reasonable  attorney  fees  and  expenses  incurred  in  such  action  or
proceeding.  In addition, you agree that you are not entitled to, and agree not to seek, advancement of attorney fees and indemnification under the
Firm’s By-Laws in the event of such a suit by the Firm.

Non-transferability:  Neither this award or any other outstanding awards of restricted stock units or of performance based share units, nor your
interests  or  rights  in  any  such  awards,  shall  be  assigned,  pledged,  transferred,  hedged,  hypothecated  or  subject  to  any  lien.    An  award  may  be
transferred following your death by will, the laws of descent or by a beneficiary designation on file with the Firm.

“Average  Tangible  Common  Equity”  means  annual  average  common  stockholders’  equity  less  annual  average  goodwill  and  annual  average

performance for the Performance Period (both percentage and ranking, as set forth in the footnote to the Performance Table); provided that if the

Payout  Percentage  in  calculating  the  number  of  PSUs  to  distribute.  For  avoidance  of  doubt,  any  cancellation  of  this  award  (in  whole  or  in  part)

in its revenue mix or business activities or its existence or its primary businesses shall terminate or cease due to receivership, bankruptcy, sale, or
otherwise, then the Committee may eliminate such institution from the list of Performance Companies or make such other equitable adjustments,
such as adding an acquirer or a new company to the list of Performance Companies, as it deems appropriate, with any such changes having effect for
purposes of all calculations hereunder on a prospective basis from the date the applicable change is made.

“Performance Period” means calendar years 20____, 20____ and 20____.

“Performance Ranking” means the ranking of the average ROTCE of the Firm as compared to the ranking of the average ROTCE of the Performance
Companies as specified in the footnote to the Performance Table for the Performance Period.

“Performance Table” means the table used in the calculation of PSUs for the Performance Period as set forth below:

If,  after  the  calculation  of  the  Performance  Ranking,  there  is  a  tie,  the  tie  shall  be  disregarded  for  purposes  of  determining  the  Award  Payout
Percentage.    For  example,  in  the  case  of  a  tie  for  the  _______  ranking  between  the  Firm  and  a  Performance  Company,  the  Firm  shall  be  treated  as
having satisfied that ranking. In the case of that same tie among Performance Companies, the _______ and _______ rankings will be deemed to have been
satisfied.

“Recognized Service” means the period of service as an employee set forth in the Firm’s applicable service-related policies.

annual  earnings  from  continuing  operations  less  dividends  on  preferred  stock  as  set  forth  in  published  financial  disclosures  by  (ii)  the  Average
Tangible  Common  Equity  for  the  year.    If,  prior  to  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  the  Firm  or  any  Performance  Company  restates  its  published
financial statements for any year in the Performance Period, ROTCE for that year shall be recalculated for the Firm or Performance Company with
the Performance Ranking adjusted, if necessary.  This calculation is used solely for purposes of the Performance Ranking.

“Target Award Number” means the number of PSUs designated as such in the Award Agreement.

sustained value and reinforcing personal accountability, as well as supporting the long-term safety and soundness
of the Company with provisions allowing for cancellation or claw-back of awards when warranted.

Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to alter the at-will employment relationship between the

Employees and any Participating Company. The provisions of this Plan reflect the policies of the Participating

the result of administrative agency or judicial proceeding.

4.2

Participation in the Plan. JPMorgan Chase or (if so delegated, the Business Unit or Participating

Company) may designate an Employee as eligible for an Award (“Eligible Employee”). Such Eligible Employee may
receive an Award; provided that

•
•

incentive compensation is established for a Performance Year pursuant to Section 4.1,
the performance of the Eligible Employee satisfies applicable criteria set forth in Section 4.3 for
the Performance Year, as determined by JPMorgan Chase or its delegate.

The amount and the form of any Award shall be determined in the sole and absolute discretion of JPMorgan Chase,
including the requirement for the execution by such Eligible Employee of such agreements as JPMorgan Chase shall
specify. No individual Awards under this Plan are guaranteed at any time during the Performance Year; provided
that in the case of new hire and retention agreements, an Award specified therein may guarantee as to amount but
all other terms and conditions of this Plan shall apply.

4.3

Individual Performance Criteria. In determining whether an Award shall be made to an

Eligible Employee, JPMorgan Chase (or if so delegated, each Business Unit or Participating Company) shall
measure the performance of an Eligible Employee based on its assessment of the contributions made to the
employing Business Unit during the Performance Year using the subjective performance criteria so determined.

•

Other criteria

◦

◦

◦
◦
◦

Generation of revenue from efforts of an Employee, including that derived from management
of a team.
Performance of complex work assignments without supervision and level of skill shown in such
performance.
Adherence to the work ethic of the Business Unit.
Performance reviews exceeding expectations.
Such  other  subjective  performance-based  criteria  as  JPMorgan  Chase  may  deem  appropriate
for  the  particular  job  function,  so  long  as  determined  within  90  days  after  the  start  of  the
Performance Year.

In evaluating the performance contribution of an Eligible Employee, those criteria that are not applicable to the job
function or role of the Employee shall be disregarded and such determination shall be that solely of JPMorgan
Chase. The determination of the applicable criteria and whether the Eligible Employee has satisfied such
performance-based criteria sufficiently to be entitled to an Award shall also be in the sole discretion of JPMorgan
Chase (or if so delegated, the management of the Business Unit or the Participating Company). Such evaluations
shall occur as of the end of the Performance Year. By way of further clarification, the determination that any
subjective performance criteria have been met shall not be made by the Eligible Employee or a family member of
the Eligible Employee as defined in the final regulations promulgated under Section 409A.

5.1

Determination of Awards. As soon as reasonably practical following the end of the applicable

Performance Year, and after having determined the contribution of, and

SECTION 5 AWARDS

performance made by, an Eligible Employee, JPMorgan Chase (or if so delegated, the Business Unit or
Participating Company) shall determine the amount of each individual Award.

5.2

Payment of Awards. (a) JPMorgan Chase shall specify a payment/distribution date of the Awards

(“Payment Date”) in the calendar year following the end of the Performance Year.

Generally, employees must be actively employed on the Payment Date specified by JPMorgan Chase in order to
receive an Award. An individual will generally not receive Awards if they have given notice of termination and/or
are no longer employed on the Payment Date.
Accordingly, an Eligible Employee has no interest in an Award until paid.

(b)

Each individual Award shall specify the amount or percentage of the performance-based

incentive compensation that shall be distributed in the form of cash, Stock- Based Awards or such other form as
may be designated by JPMorgan Chase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Award Agreement of a Participant
who is not a United States citizen and who works outside of the United States so provides, a Participating
Company may deliver property or make contributions to a trust in lieu of providing incentive compensation
hereunder.

(c)

If JPMorgan Chase so advises and Eligible Employee agrees, the cash portion of any performance-

based incentive compensation may be deferred pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Deferred Compensation
Program of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Participating Companies, or any successor plan or any applicable deferral
program available to Eligible Employees who are based in locations outside the United States.

(d)

The portion of any performance-based incentive compensation payable as a Stock-Based Award
shall be granted pursuant to the terms of an approved equity compensation plan or arrangement as determined
by JPMorgan Chase in its sole discretion.

(e)

It  is  expressly  intended  that  the  Awards  whether  or  not  vested  or  immediately  payable  are
designed to promote continued employment and future services from an Eligible Employee, as well as reward
for performance.

(f)

All Awards will be reflected in Award Agreements signed by an authorized officer of JPMorgan
Chase. No employee or officer of JPMorgan Chase is authorized to make oral promises or representations about
Awards under this Plan.

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
Effective as of January 1, 2021 (as amended)

SECTION 6

TAXES AND OTHER WITHHOLDING

Participating Companies shall have the right to (i) deduct from all amounts payable to any recipient of an Award
(whether amounts are payable in cash), and each recipient shall make appropriate arrangements to pay the
withholding amounts related to any taxes or other amounts required by law to be withheld, and (ii) offset any
amounts otherwise payable hereunder by any amount the recipient owes a Participating Company, to the full
extent permitted by law.

SECTION 7

NON-TRANSFERABILITY

No  rights  hereunder  or  Awards  shall  be  assignable  or  transferable  except  as  specified,  and  no  right  or

interest in any Award shall be subject to any lien, obligation or liability of the Eligible Employee.

SECTION 8

NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT CONTINUED PLAN PARTICIPATION

No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be
construed as giving the Employee recipient the right to be retained in the employ of a Participating Company. In
addition, no Award under the Plan made during or in respect of any Performance Year or other period shall confer
on an Employee any right or entitlement to, nor shall any Award impose any obligation on a Participating Company
to  provide,  the  same  or  any  similar  Award  in  the  future,  and  all  Plan  awards  are  made  wholly  at  the  sole  and
unrestricted discretion of JPMorgan Chase. Further, each Participating Company expressly reserves the right at any
time to terminate an Employee or Eligible Employee employed by it or free from any liability or any claim under the
Plan, except as provided herein or in any Award granted hereunder.

SECTION 9

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

JPMorgan Chase may amend or terminate the Plan or any portion hereof at any time and in any manner,

provided that the subjective individual performance criteria set forth in Section
4.3 can only be amended prior to the expiration of the Performance Year to which such criteria pertain.

SECTION 10 STATUS OF
PLAN
The Plan is intended to constitute an “unfunded” incentive compensation plan. With respect to any

payments not yet made to a recipient of an Award by a Participating Company, nothing herein contained shall
provide any such individual with any rights that are greater than those of a general, unsecured creditor of the
Participating Company. No such individual shall at any time possess any interest whatsoever in the assets of the
Participating Company. No payments under this Plan shall be taken into account as salary or other relevant
compensation in determining an Employee’s benefits under any compensation, pension or welfare plan (unless the
plan specifically permits the inclusion of such Award), program or arrangement maintained by the Participating
Company. In addition, the terms of this document and any particular Award document granted to an Employee shall
exclusively embody the complete terms of the Plan as applied to such an individual and shall supersede any other
documents or representations that in any way relate to any Award.

No failure on the part of the Participating Company to exercise, and to delay in exercising, any right or

power under the Plan shall operate as a waiver of any such right or power; nor shall any single or partial exercise
preclude any other or further exercise of a right or power or the exercise of any other right or power.

SECTION 11

WAIVER

PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
Effective as of January 1, 2021 (as amended)

SECTION 12
SEVERABILITY
Each provision of the Plan will be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective but if any

provision shall be ruled invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
invalidity or unenforceability of such provision in such jurisdiction shall not affect any of the remaining provisions
of the Plan and the invalid term shall be deemed to be replaced in such jurisdiction by a valid term which most
closely reflects the intent of the Plan.

SECTION 13
ASSIGNMENT

If JPMorgan Chase shall be merged into or consolidated with another entity, this Plan shall be binding
upon the entity surviving such merger or resulting from such consolidation. JPMorgan Chase shall require any
successor to all or substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s equity or assets (whether by direct or indirect purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to, either expressly or by operation of law, assume and agree to perform
under this Plan as if no such succession had taken place, and all references to the “JPMorgan Chase” herein shall
become references to such successor.

SECTION 14 GOVERNING
LAW

The validity, construction and effect of the Awards, the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the
Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws
principles.

The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall continue until terminated by the JPMorgan

Chase.
