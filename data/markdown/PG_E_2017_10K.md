The
California
Public
Utilities
Commission

The CPUC is a regulatory agency that regulates privately owned public utilities in California.   The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions
of servi ce for the Utility's electric and natural gas dist ribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services.  The CPUC also
has jurisdiction over the Utility's issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility's electric and natural
gas retail customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providing electric
and natural gas utility service.

The CPUC enforces state laws and regulations that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utility
gas and electric facilities.   The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $50,000 per day, per violation, for violations that occurred after January 1, 2012.  (The
statutory maximum penalty for violations that occurred before January 1, 2012 is $20,000 per violation.)   The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount
of penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the
number of persons affected; and the g ood faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation.  The CPUC also is
required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.

The CPUC has delegated auth ority to the SED to issue citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports.  Under
the current gas and el ectric citation programs adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if
it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation
issued.  The SED may, at its discretion, impose p enalties on a daily basis, or on less than a d aily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day.  The
SED has the discretion to either address each violation in a distinct citation or to include multiple violations in a single citation regard less of whether the violations
occurred in the same incident or are of a similar nature. Penalty payments for citations issued pursuant to the gas and electric safety citation programs are the
responsibility of shareholders of an issuer and must not be rec overed in rates or otherwise directly or indir ectly charged to customers.

The California State Legislature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to increasing renewable energy resources, the
development an d widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the establishment of energy
storage procurement targets , and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  T he CPU C is responsible for approving funding and
administration of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs.  The CPUC also conducts audits and reviews of
the Utility’s accounting, performance , and compliance w ith regulatory guidelines .

T he CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financial
conditions that require PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and
prudent to meet the Utility's obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial
Resour ces” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
and
the
California
Independent
System
Operator

The FERC has jurisdictio n over the Utility's electric transmission revenue requirements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility's hydroelectric
generation facilities, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas.  The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s trans mission systems with
other electric system and generation facilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesale
electricity sales.  The FERC also is charged with adopting and enforcing mandatory standards governing the reliabi lity of the nation’s electric transmission grid,
including standards to protect the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The FERC has authority to
impo se fines of up to $1 million per day for violation s of certain federal statutes and regulations.

The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmission organization for the Utility’s service territory.  The CAISO controls the operation of the electric trans
mission system in California and provides open access transmission service on a non - discriminatory basis.  The CAISO also is responsible for planning
transmission system additions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of generating capacity, and e nsuring that the reliability of the transmission system is
maintained.

9

The
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission

The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo
Canyon and the Utility’s retired nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay.  (See “Electric ity Resources” below.)  NRC regulations require extensive monitoring
and review of the safety, radiological, seismic, environmental, and security aspec ts of these facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority
to impose fines or to force a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both.  NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capital
expenditures at Diablo Canyon, and substantial capital expenditures could be required in the future.   (For more information about Diablo Canyon, see “Regulatory
Matters – Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors below.)

Third-
party
m
onitor

On April 12, 2017, the Utility retained a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27,
2017 federal criminal conviction, which sentenced the Utility to, among other th ings, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor
for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years.   The goal of the monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable
and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of its gas and el ectric operations and maintains effective ethics, compliance , and safety related incentive programs on
a Utility-wide basis.   (For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

Other
Regula
tors

The CEC is the state's primary energy policy and planning agency.  The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.
The CEC also is responsible for forecasts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities' electricity procurement plans and
for adopting building and appliance energy efficiency requirements.

The CARB is the state agency responsible for setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits.  The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcing
regulations to implement state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California.  (See “Environmental Regulation - Air Quality and Climate
Change” below.)

In addition, the Utility obtains perm its, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility's generation facilities,
electricity transmission lines, natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities.  The Utility also perio dically obtains permits,
authorizations, and licenses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for the
operation of the Utility's business and to conduct certain relat ed operations.  The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties that
permit the Utility to install, operate, and maintain the Utility's electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highway s.  In exchange for the right to use
public streets and highway s, the Utility pays annual fees to the cities and counties.  In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term,
with no expiration date.   (For additional information see Item 1A. Ris k Factors.)

10

Ratemaking
Mechanisms

The Utility’s rates for electric and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service and a
return on invested capital (“cost-of-service ratemaking”).  Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the annual amount that
the Utility will be authorized to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”).  The U tility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to
enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses ( e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs ( e.g., depreciation, tax,
and financing expen ses).  In addition, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass-through” to
customers (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A) , including its co sts to procure electricity, natural gas and
nuclear fuel, to administer public purpose and customer programs, and to decommission its nuclear facilities.

The Utility’s rate of return on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceeding s.  Similarly, the authorized rate of return on all other Utility
assets is set in the CPUC’s cost of capital proceeding.  Other than its electric transmission and certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base
revenues are “decoupled” f rom its sales volume.  Regulatory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, are designed to allow the Utility to fully
collect its authorized base revenue requirements.  As a result, the Utility’s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from rate changes or
usage.  The Utility’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that
Impacted Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.

Due to the seasonal nature of the Utility’s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May – October) because of
higher demand, driven by air conditioning loads.   Customer bills related to gas service generally increase during the winter months (November – March) to
account for the gas peak due to heating.

During 201 7 , the CPUC continued to implement state law requirements to reform residential electric rates to more closely ref lect the utilities’ actual costs of
service, reduce cross-subsidization among customer rate classe s, implement new rules for net energy metering (which currently allow certain self-generating
customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate) , and allow customers to have greater control over their energy use.  (See “ Regulatory
Matters ” in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC proceedings . )

From time to time, the CPUC may use incentive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues.   For example,
the Utility has earned incentives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.  (See “Regulatory Matters – 2015 – 2016 Energy Efficiency
Incentives Awards” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Base
Revenues

General
Rate
Cases

The GRC is the primary proceeding in which the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect from
customers to recover the Utility’s anticipated co sts, including return on rate base, related to its electric distribution, natura l gas distribution, and Utility- owned
electric generation operations.  The CPUC generally conducts a GRC every three or four years.  The CPUC approves the annual revenue requir ements for the first
year (or “test year”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC
period (known as “attrition years”).  Attrition year rate adjustments are generally provided for cost increases related to increases in invested capital and inflation.
Parties in the Utility's GRC include the ORA and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as a myriad of other i
ntervenors who represent other business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests.  The Utility plans to file the 20 20 GRC in the third quarter of
2018.  In December 2014, t he CPUC established two new procedures concerning safety-related act ivities, the Safety Model Assessment Proceeding and the
RAMP, preceding a utility’s GRC . The purpose of the Safety Model Assessment Proceeding is to undertake a comprehensive analysis of each utility’s risk-based
decision making approach.  The RAMP submit tal includes a utility’s prioritization of the risks it is facing , and a prioritization of risk mitigation alternatives, as
well as a risk mitigation plan.  The Utility filed its first RA MP submittal with the CPUC on November 30, 2017.

and
Storage
Rate
Cases

The CPUC determines the Utility’s authorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.   The
CPUC generally conducts a GT&S rate case every three or four years.   Similar to the GRC, t he CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the fir st year
(or “test year”) of the GT&S rate case period and typically determines annual increases in revenue requirements for attrition years of the GT&S rate case period.
Parties in the Utility's GT&S rate case include the ORA and TURN, who generally repre sent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as other
intervenors who represent other business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests.  The Utility filed the 2019 GT&S rate case application on
November 17, 2017.   (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters – 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters – 2019 Gas
Transmission and Storage Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Cost
of
Capital
Proceedings

The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of capit al proceeding to authorize the Utility's capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric and
natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base.  The CPUC has authorized the Utility’s capital structure through 2019, consisting of
52% common equity, 47% long-term debt, and 1% preferred stock.  The CPUC also set the authorized ROE through 2017 at 10.40% and 10.25% beginning on
January 1, 2018 and reset the cost of debt to 4.89% .  The CPUC adopted an adjust ment mechanism to allow the Utility’s capital structure and ROE to be adjusted
if the utility bond index changes by certain thresholds on an annual basis.

(For more information, s ee “Regulatory Matters – CPUC Cost of Capital ” in Item 7. MD&A. )

Owner
Rate
Cases

The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirement s , including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in
rates in the TO rate case.  The Utility has historically file d a TO rate case every year.  The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the
requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision.  These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in t he
Utility's retail electric rates and by the CAISO in its Transmission Access Charges to wholesale customers .  ( For more information, s ee “ Regulatory Matters –
Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in Item 7. MD&A.)  The Utility also recovers a portion of its rev enue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs
through charges collected under specific contracts with wholesale transmission customers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations.
These wholesale customers are cha rged individualized rates based on the terms of their contracts.

Procurement
Costs

California investor-owned electric utilities are responsible for procuring electr ical cap acity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reserve
margins, that are not satisfied from their own generation facilities and existing electric contracts.  The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric
generation reso urces, including certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources
are the least expensive (i.e., using the principles of “least-cost dispatch”).  In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their bundled customer
procurement plans based on long-term demand forecasts.  In October 2015, the CPUC approved the Utility’s most recent bundled customer procurement plan.  It
was revised since its initial approval an d will remain in effect as revised until superseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan.

California law allows electric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved bundled customer procurement plans without further
after-the-fact reasonableness review by the CPUC .  The CPUC may disallow c osts associated with electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in
compliance with the CPUC-approved plan or if the CPUC determines that the utility failed to foll ow the principles of least-cost dispatch.  Additionally, the CPUC
may disallow the cost of replacement power procured due to unplanned outages at Utility-owned generation facilities.

12

The Utility recovers its electric procurement costs annually primarily t hrough the energy resource recovery account .  (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.)  Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative
instruments , GHG emissions costs, and generation fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement.  The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electric
rates more frequently if the forecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the energy reso urce recovery account exceed 5% of its prior year electric
procurement and U tility-owned generation revenues.  The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the energy resource
recovery account.

The CPUC has approved variou s power purchase agreements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approved
procurement plan, to meet mandatory renewable energy targets , and to comply with resource adequacy requirements.  (For more info rmation, s ee “Electric
Utility Operations – Electricity Resources” below as well as Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. )

Natural
Gas
Procurement
,
Storage,
and
Transportation
Costs

The Utility recovers the cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.

The Utility sets the natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecasted
costs of natural gas, core pipeline capacity and storage costs.  The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost of
derivative instruments for its core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its core procurement incentive mechanism described
below .  The Utility reflects the difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancin g
accounts, with under-collections and over-collections taken into account in subsequent monthly rate change s.

The core procurement incentive mechanism protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for i ts core gas portfolio
.  Under the core procurement incentive mechanism , the Utility’s natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-
based benchmark based on a weighted average of published monthly and daily natu ral gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural
gas.  Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99% to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’
rates.  One-ha lf of the costs above 102% of the benchmark are recoverable in customers’ rates, and the Utility's customers receive in their rates 80% of any
savings resulting from the Utility’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark.  The Utility ret ains the remaining amount of these savings as
incentive revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs.  While this mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural
gas, consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact net income.

The Utility incurs transportation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers.  These providers
transport natural gas from the points at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United
States) to the points at which the Utility's natural gas transportation system begins.   These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tar iffs that detail rates,
rules, and terms of service for the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines.  The FERC approves the
United States tariffs that shippers , including the Utility, pay for pip eline service , and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board ,
a Canadian regulatory agency .  The transportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas
pr ocurement costs or as a cost of electricity.

Programs

The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utility
customers.   These programs relate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters.
Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Utility to provide a discount rate for low-income custom ers, known as California Alternate Rates for Energy
(“CARE”), which is subsidized by the Utility’s other customers.

Nuclear
Decommissioning
Costs

The Utility's nuclear power facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Hum boldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the safe
removal of nuclear facilities from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the
property for unrestricted use.  Nuclear d ecommissioning costs are collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for
the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.  The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approv al of the Utility’s updated
estimated decommissioning costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission the
Utility’s nuclear plants.

On January 11 , 201 8 , the CPUC approved the retire ment of Diablo Canyon ’s two nuclear power reactor units by 2024 and 2025 .   (For more information, see “
Regulatory Matters ” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Electric
Utility
Operations

The Utility generates electricity and provides electric transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California to
residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers.  The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission and distribution services) to
most c ustomers in its service territory.  Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-
generation resources, such as rooftop solar installations.

The Utility has continued to invest in its vision for a future electric grid which w ill allow customers to choose new, advanced energy supply technologies and
services to meet their needs consistent with safe, reliable and affordable electric service.  In 2017, the Ut ility continued to work on the foundation for its program
to deploy up to 7,500 charging stations. (For more information, see “ Regulatory Matters ” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Electricity
Resources

The Utility is required to maintain generating capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and
operating reserves, deliverable to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service.  The Utility is required to dispatch, or schedule
all of the electric resources within its portfolio in the most cost-effective way .

The following table shows the percentage of the Utility’s total deliveries of electricity to customers in 201 7 represented by each major electric resource, and fu

Renewable
Energy
Resources

California law established a n RPS that requires load-serving entities, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to their
customers .  In October 2015, the California Governor signed SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 into law. SB 350 became effective
January 1, 2016, and increases the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving ent ities, including the Utility, to their customers from
33% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030 compl
iance period, and in each three-ye ar com pliance period thereafter, unless changed by legislative action.  SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waiver
mechanisms, including increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance perio ds.  The Utility
will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable from
customers as “pass-through” costs.  The Utility also may be subject to penaltie s for failure to meet the higher targets.  The CPUC is required to open a new
rulemaking proceeding to adopt regulations to implement the higher renewable targets.

Renewable generation resources, for purposes of the RPS requirements , include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW or
less), wind, solar, and geothermal energy.  During 201 7 , 33.1 % of the Utility’s energy deliveries were from renewable energy sources, exceeding the annual RPS
target of 2 7 %.  Approxima tely 29 % of the renewable energy delivered to the Utility’s customers was purchased from non-QF third parties.   Additional
renewable resources were provided by QFs ( 1.9 %), the Utility’s small hydroelectric facilities ( 1.7 %), and the Utility’s solar facilit ies ( 0.5 %).

As required by California law, the CPUC has opened a proceeding to establish a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, including energy storage
procurement targets to be achieved by each load-serving entity under the CPUC jurisdiction, including the Utility.  Under the adopted energy storage procurement
framework, the Utility is required to procure 580 MW of qualifying storage capacity by 2020, with all energy storage projects required to be operational by the end
of 2024.

The CPUC also adopted biennial interim storage targets for the Utility, beginning in 2014 and ending in 2020.  Under the adopted framework, the Utility is
required to conduct biennial competitive request for offer to he lp meet its interim storage targets.

The Utility’s 201 7 energy storage target is 120 MW , plus an additional amount to replace failed and rejected agreements for a total of approximately 160 MW .
On November 30, 2016, the Utility issued its 2016 request for offer . On December 1, 2017, the Utility submitted contracts for 165 MW of energy storage projects
for CPUC review.  One of the projects is a 20 MW distribution deferral project that would be Utility-owned.

The Utility currently owns or operates thre e battery storage facilities, each less than 10 MW.

(1 ) The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant consists of two nuclear power reactor units, Units 1 and 2.  The NRC operating licenses expire in 2024 and 2025, respectively.  On January 11,
2018, the CPUC approved the Utility’s application to retire Unit 1 by 202 4 and Unit 2 by 2025. ( See “Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant ” in . Item 7. MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)
(2) The Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 106 generating units at 66 powerhouses. All of the Utility’s powerhouses are licensed by the FERC (except for two small powerhouses not

subject to FERC licensing requirements), with license terms between 30 and 50 years.

(3) The Utility’s large photovoltaic facilities are Cantua solar station ( 20 MW), Five Points solar station (15 MW), Gates solar station (20 MW), Giffen solar station (10 MW), Guernsey solar
station (20 MW), Huron solar station (20 MW ), Stroud solar station (20 MW), West Gates solar station (10 MW), and Westside solar station ( 15 MW).  All of these facilities are located in
Fresno County, except for Guernsey solar station, which is located in Kings County.

The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase power and electric c apacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance with
its CPUC-approved procurement plan.  ( S ee “Ratemaking Mechanisms” above.)  For more information regarding the Utility’s power purchase agreements, see
Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Electricity
Transmission

At December   31, 201 7 , the Utility owned approximately 1 9 , 200 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to
500 kV.  The Utility al so operated 9 2 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 64, 7 00 M VA.  The Utility’s electric transmission
system is interconnected with electric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Co uncil, which includes many western states, Alberta and British
Columbia, and parts of Mexico.

Decisions about expansions and maintenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of our regulators. For example, in 2013, the Utility,
MidAmerican Transmission, LLC, a nd Citizens Energy Corporation were selected by the CAISO to jointly develop a new 230-kV transmission line to address the
growing power demand in the Fresno, Madera and Kings counties area.  However, the 2022 in-service date for the 70-mile line was subse quently postponed by the
CAISO, and the CAISO has placed the project on hold.   The Utility has stopped all work on the project pending a decision from the CAISO that could defer or
cancel the project.  A decision by the CAISO is expected by March 2018.  In addition, as a part of the CAISO's 2016-2017 planning efforts, the CAISO found that
a number of lower-voltage transmission projects were no long er required and recommended cancelling or requiring further review in the 2017-2018 planning
cycle.

17

Throughout 201 7 , the Utility upgraded several substations and re-conductored a number of transmission lines to improve maintenance and system flexibility,
reliability and safety.  The Utility expects to undertake various additional transmission projects over the next several years to upgrade and expand the capacity of
its transmission system to secure access to renewable generation resources and replace aging or obsolete equipment and improve system reliability.  The Utility
also has taken steps to improve the physica l security of its transmission substations and equipment.

Electricity
Distribution

The Utility's electric distribution network consists of a pproximately 1 07 , 2 00 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which approximately 20% are underground
and approxima tely 80% are overhead), 5 9 transmission switching substations, and 605 distribution substations, with a capacity of approximately 3 1 , 8 00 MVA.
The Utility’s distribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distrib ution substations, where equipment reduces the
high-voltage transmissio n voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers.

These distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network.  Emanating from each substation are primary and secondary
distribution lines connected to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users.  In some cases, the Utility
sells electricity from its distribution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity.  The Utility operates electric distribution
control center facilit ies in Concord , Roc klin, and Fresno , California ; t hese control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more
resilient grid.

In 2017, the Utility continued to deploy its f ault l ocation, i solation, and s ervice r estoration circuit technology that involves the rapid operation of smart switches
to reduce the duration of customer outages.  Another 92 circuits were outfitted with this equipment, bringing the total deployment to 882 of the Utility’s 3,200
distribution circuits.  The Utility plans to con tinue performing work to improve the reliability and safety of its electric distribution operations in 2018.

Natural
Gas
Utility
Operations

The Utility provides natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,
industrial, large commerci al, and natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.   Core
customers can purchase natural gas procurement service (i.e. ,
natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement service
providers (referred to as core transport agents).   When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gas
delivery, metering and billing services to customer s.     When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combined
service as “bundled” natural gas service.   Currently, more th an 95% o f core customers, representing approximately 80 % of the annual core market d emand,
receive bundled natural gas service from the Utility.

The Utility generally does not provide procurement service to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers , unless the
customer is a natural gas-fired gene ration facility that the Utility has a power purchase agreement with that includes its generation fuel expense .  The Utility
offers backbone gas transmission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and dist inct services to its non-core
customers.   Access to the Utility's backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.   The
Utility also delivers gas to off-system customers ( i.e ., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.

19

Natural
Gas
Supplies

The Utility can receive natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and
the southwestern United States.  The Utility can also receive natural gas from fields in California.  The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customers
directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States. The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gas
purchase contracts have varied generally based on market conditions.  During 201 7 , the Utility purchased appr oximately 291,100 MMcf o f natural gas (net of
the sale of e xcess supply of gas).  Substantially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less.  The Utility’s largest
individual supplier represented approximately 14% of the total natural gas volume the Utility purchased durin g 201 7 .

Natural
Gas
System
Assets

The Utility owns and operates an integrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California.  At
December 31, 201 7 , the Utility’s natural gas system consisted of approximately 42, 800 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6, 4 00 miles of backbone and local
transmission pipelines, and various storage facilities.  The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system and
one small station on its local transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines.  The Utility’s backbone transmission system, composed
primarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is u sed to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, and
California gas fields to the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems.

The Utility has firm transportation agreements f or delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA Gas
Transmission,   Ltd. interconnecting downstream with TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines   Ltd., B.C. System.  The Foothills system interconnects at the bo rder to
the pipeline system owned by Gas Transmission Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’s
natural gas transportation system on the Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon. The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline,
LLC to transport natural gas from the U.S . Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin,
O regon, at the Calif ornia border.  Similarly, the Utility has firm transportation agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC and El Paso Natural Ga s
Company to transport natural gas from supply points in the Southwestern United States to interconnection points with th e Utility's natural gas transportation
system in the area of California near Topock, Arizona.  The Utility also has a transportation agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company to transport
gas from the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection po int with the Utility’s natural gas system in the area of Daggett, California.  ( For more information
regarding the Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. )

20

The Utility o wns and operates three underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to the
Utility’s transmission system.   The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storag e fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for
storage and later withdrawal.   In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility's northern California transmission system.   Changes
to gas storage safety requirements by DOGGR have led the Utility to develop and propose in its 2019 GT&S rate case application a natural gas storage strategy
which includes the discontinuation (through closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields.   (For more information, see “ R egulatory Matters ” in Item 7.
MD&A.)

In 2017, the Utility continued upgrading transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and continued its work on the final NTSB
recommendation from its San Bruno investigation to hydrostatical ly test all high consequence pipeline mileage.  The Utility currently plans to complete this NTSB
recommendation by 2022 for remaining short pipeline segments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmission p
ipelines.

California law allows qualifying non-residential electric customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather
than from the utilities up to certain annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility.  This arrangement is known as “direct access.”  In
addition, California law permits cities, counties, and certain other public agencies th at have qualified to become a CCA to generate and/or purchase electricity for
their local residents and businesses.  By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents and businesses that do not a ffirmatively elect to continue to
receive electr icity generated or procured by a utility.

21

The Utility continues to provide transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers, although these customers can choose to obtain
metering and billing services from their energy service provider.  The CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services
from the Utility.  In addition to collecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Ut ility is able to collect charges
intended to recover the generation-related costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of direct access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers.
The Utility remains the electricity provider of last resort f or these customers.

The Utility is also impacted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage.  The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers
(primarily solar installations) and the us e of customer net ener gy met ering (“NEM”), which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits at the full
retail rate, are increasing.  These factors result in a shift of cost responsibility for grid and related services to other customers of the Utility.  For examp le, in
creasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers
to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pre ssure on remaining customers.  N ew rules and rates became effective for new
NEM customers of the Utility in December 2016.  New NEM customers are required to pay an interconnection fee, comply with time of use rates, and are required
to pay certain non-bypassabl e charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay.  Significantly
higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers.  The CPUC has
indicated that it intends to revisit these rules in 2019.

Further, in some circumstances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute to
provide retail electric service, may seek to acquire the Utility’s distribution facilities, generally through eminent domain.  These same entities may, and sometimes
do, construct duplicate distribution facilities to serve existing or new Utility customer s.

The effect of such types of retail competition generally is to reduce the amount of electricity purchased by customers from the Utility.

The Utility also competes for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission fa cilities within, or interconnected to, its service
territory through a competitive biddin g process managed by the CAISO.   The FERC's transmission planning requirements rules, effective in 2011, removed the
incumbent public utility transmission owners' fede rally-based right of first refusal to construct certain new transmission facilities and mandated regional and
interregional transmission planning.  In 2014, the FERC approved the CAISO's process for regional planning and competitive solicitations and the C AISO's
interregional planning process.

( For risks in connection with increasing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. )

Competition
in
the
Natural
Gas
Industry

The Utility competes with other natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting na tural gas into the southern California market on the basis of
transportation rates, access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services.  The Utility also competes for
storage services with oth er third-party storage providers, primarily in northern California.

Environmental
Regulation

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and
health of the Utility's personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and
radioactive substances; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the re porting and reduction of CO ­ 2 and other GHG emissions; the transportation,
handling, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, includi ng endangered species and habitat protection.

The
penalties for violation of these laws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions.  These laws and
requirements also may require the Utility, u nder certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)  Generally, the Utility
recovers most of the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the Utility's rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental costs
associated with the clean-up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 13 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .

22

Hazardous
Waste
Compliance
and
Re
mediation

The Utility's facilities are subject to various regulations adopted by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended.  The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted
by other federal agenc ies responsible for implementing federal environmental laws.  The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations
adopted by the State of Cal ifornia and various state and local agencies.  These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance
on the (1) owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and
(3) in some cases, their corporate successors.  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act , these persons (known as
“potentially responsible parties”) may be jointly an d severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harm
caused to natural resources, and paying for the costs of health studies.

The Utility has a comprehensive program in place to comply with these fed eral, state, and local laws and regulations.  Under federal and California laws, the
Utility may be responsible for remediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site.  The Utility’s remediation activities are
overs een by the California DTSC , several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.  The Utility has
incurred significant environmental remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where
natural gas compressor stations are located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances.  Groundwater at
the Utility’s Hinkley a nd Topock natural gas compressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices.  The Utility is
responsible for remediating this groundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.

For more information about environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Air
Quality
and
Climate
Change

The Utility's electric generation plants, natural gas pipeline op erations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws,
including the federal Clean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes.  These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to t he
formation of ground-level ozone, CO 2 , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), mono-nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter, and other GHG emissions.

Federal
Regulation

At the federal level, the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.  Although there have been several legislative attempts to
address climate change through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted.  In the
absence of federal legislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.

The federal administration of President Donald Trump has led to significant uncertainty with regard to what further actions may occur regarding climate change at
the federal level.  Upon taking office, President Trump issued an executive order to freeze all regulations issued in the 60 days preceding his inauguration and
directed the EPA and the White House to remove climate change-related materials and web pages.   In October 2017, the EPA issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking to formally repeal the Clean Power Plan regulations.  The Trump administration is expected to take further action to substantially limit climate related
regulatory and funding activities.  In lig ht of the policy reversal at the federal level, the State of California has indicated that it intends to continue and enhance its
leadership on climate change nationally and globally.

23

State
Regulation

California ’s AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, provides for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.  The
CARB has approved various regulations to achieve the 2020 target , including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program t
hat sets gradually declining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of the
economy.  The cap - and-trade program’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied t o the electric generation and large industrial sectors.
The next compliance period, which began on January 1, 2015, expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors, effectively covering all the
economy’s major sectors until 2020.  The Utili ty’s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of
natural gas delivered to the Utility’s customers other than natural gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own
compliance obligation.  During each year of the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG
emissions allowed for that year.  Emitters can obtain allowances from the CARB at qu arterly auctions or from third parties or exchanges.  Emitters may also
satisfy a portion of their compliance obligation through the purchase of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties (such as
landowners, livestock owner s, and farmers) that occur outside of the emitters’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as refo restation or biomass
projects.  SB 32 (2016) requires that CARB ensure a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases b y 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  I n 2017, AB 398 extended the cap-
and-trade program to 2030.   The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to b e passed through to customers.  The
California RPS program that requires the utilities to gradually inc rease the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce
GHG emissions in California.

Climate
Change
Resilience
Strategies

During 201 7 , the Utility continued its programs to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s o perations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and to
plan for the actions that it will need to take to increase its resilience in light of the likely impacts of climate change on the Utility’s operations.  The Utility
regularly reviews the most relevant scientific literature on climate change such as rising sea level s, major storm events , increasing temperature s and heatwaves,
wildfires, drought and land subsidence , to help the Utility identify and evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary resilience strategies.  The
Utility maintains emergency response plans and procedures to address a range of near-term risks, including wildfires , extreme storms, and  heat waves and uses its
risk-assessment process to prioritize infra structure investments for longer-term risks associated with climate change.  The Utility also engages with leaders from
business, government, academia, and non-profit organizations to share information and plan for the future.

The Utility is working to better understand the current and future impacts of climat e change.  In 2017, the Utility filed its first RAMP submittal with the CPUC,
which examined Utility safety risks. The Climate Resilience RAMP model indicated potential additional Utility safety con sequences due to climate change,
including in the near term.  The Utility is conducting foundational work to help anticipate and plan for evolving conditions in terms of weather and climate-change
related events.  This work will guide efforts to design a Ut ility-wide climate change risk integration strategy.  This strategy will inform resource planning and
investment, operational decisions, and potential additional programs to identify and pursue mitigations that will incorporate the resilience and safety of the Utility’s
assets, infrastructure, operations, employees, and customers.

With respect to electric operations, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demand
due to more ex treme, persistent, and frequent hot weather.  The Utility believes its str ategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demand
response programs, infrastructure improvements, and the use of rene wable energy and energy storage are effective strategies for a dapting to the expected changes
in demand for electricity.  The Utility is making substantial investments to build a more modern and resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather and
related emergencies. Over the long-term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding and inundation potential at coastal and low elevation facilities due to sea
level rise combined with high tides, storm runoff and storm surges.   As the state continues to face increased risk of wildfire, t he Utility’s vegetation management
activities will continue to play an important role to help reduce the risk of wildfire and its impact on electric and gas facilities.

C limate scientists predict that climate change will result in varying temperatures and le vels of precipitation in the Utility’s service territory .  This could, in turn,
affect the Utility’s hydroelectric generation.  To plan for this potential change, the Utility is engaging with state and local stakeholders and is also adopting
strategies suc h as maintaining higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases, and collaborating on research and
new modeling tools.

24

With respect to natural gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testin g and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane into
the atmosphere.  The Utility has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reduce
the pressure and v olume of natural gas within pipelines prior to venting.   In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in methane emissions by
implementing improvements in leak detection and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipeline
materials.

Emissions
Data

PG&E Corporation and the Utility track and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas.  The Utility reports its GHG
emissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a voluntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The Climate
Registry, a non-pro fit organization.  The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2 01 6, the most recent data
available, totaled more than 50 milli on metric tonnes of CO ­ 2 equivalent , three-quarters of which came from customer natural gas use.  The following table shows
the 201 6 GHG emissions data the Utility reported to the CARB under AB 32 . PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publish additional GHG emissions data in
their annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

Water
Quality

In 2014, the EPA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electric
power plants, such as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best tech nology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.
Various industry and environmental groups have challenged the federal regulations in proceedings pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
California’s once-through cooling po licy discussed below is considered to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations.  Therefore, California’s
implementation process for the state policy will likely continue without any significant change.

At the state level, in 2010 , the Calif ornia Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other
significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.   The policy also provided for an
alternative compliance approach for nuclear plants if certain criteria were met.  As required by the policy , the California Water Board appointed a committee to
evaluate the feasibility and cost of using alternative techno logies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon.  The committee’s consultant submitted its final report
to the California Water Board in September 2014 .  The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Can yon,
such as cooling towers.

On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered into a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon ’s two nuclear power reactor units at the expiration of their
current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 .   As a result o f the planned retirement, the California Water Board will no longer need to address alternative
compliance measures for Diablo Canyon.  A s required under the p olicy, the Utility paid an annual interim mitigation fee beginning in 2017, which it will continu
e to pay until operations cease in 2025 .

Additionally, t he Utility expects that its decision to retire Diablo Canyon will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility, the Central
Coast Board and the California Attorney General’s Office regarding the thermal component of the plant’s once-through cooling discharge.  (For more information,
see “Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.)

Nuclear
Fuel
Disposal

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts under
which the DOE would be required to dispose of the utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by the
utilities’ customers.  The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nuclear
generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired nuclear facility at Humbol dt Bay.  As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store
its spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel.  The Utility and o
ther nuclear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel.

In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that awarded the Utility $266 million for spent fuel
storage costs incurred through December 31, 2010.  The settlement agreement also provided a claims process by which the Utility submits annual requ ests for
reimbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.   Through 2017, the Utility has been awarded an additional $114 million through these annual submissions ,
including $15 million for costs incurred between June 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016.   The cl aim for the period June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2017, totaled
approximately $29 million and is currently under review by the DOE.   These proceeds are being refunded to customers through rates.   A new settlement
agreement, for costs through 2019 was execute d in March 2017.  Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when and whether the DOE will meet its
contractual obligation to the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.

ITEM
1A.
RISK
FACTORS

PG&E Corporation’s an d the Utility’s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting
policies described in MD&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results.  The
following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction
with MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statem ents and related N otes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial condition, results of o perations,
liquidity, cash flows, and stock price.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting
from the impact of the multip le wildfires that spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte, Lake,
Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City, beginning on October 8, 2017 (the “Northern California wildf ires”).  According to the
Cal Fire California Statewide Fire Summary dated October   30, 2017, at the peak of the wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total, burned
over 245,000 acres, resulted in 43 fatalities, and destroyed an es timated 8,900 structures.  Subsequently, the number of fatalities increased to 44.

The Utility incurred $219 million in costs for service restoration and repair to the Utility’s facilities (including $97 million in capital expenditures) through
December 3 1, 2017 in connection with these fires.  While the Utility believes that such costs are recoverable through CEMA, its CEMA requests are subject to
CPUC approval.  The Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to recover
such costs.

The fires are being investigated by Cal Fire and the CPUC, including the possible role of the Utility’s power lines and other facilities.  The Utility expects that Cal
Fire will issue a report or reports stating its conclusions as to the sources of ignition of the fires and the ways that they progressed.  The CPUC’s SED also is
conducting investigations to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with appl icable rules and regulations in fire impacted
areas.  According to information made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities, vegetation
management, and emergency preparedness and response.  Var ious other entities, including fire departments, may also be investigating certain of the fires.  (For
example, on February 3, 2018, it was reported that investigators with the Santa Rosa Fire Department had completed their investigation of two small fires that
reportedly destroyed two homes and damaged one outbuilding and had concluded that the Utility’s facilities, along with high wind and other factors, contributed to
those fires.)  It is uncertain when the investigations will be complete and whether Cal Fire will release any preliminary findings before its investigation is
complete.

As of January 31, 2018, the Utility had submitted 22 electric incident reports to the CPUC associated with the Northern California wildfires where Cal Fire has
identified a site as potentially involving the Utility’s facilities in its investigation and the property damage associated with each incident exceeded $50,000.  The
information contained in these reports is factual and preliminary, and does not reflect a determinati on of the causes of the fires.  The investigations into the fires
are ongoing.

If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse
condemna tion applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the
aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility .  (See “The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied
by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially
negatively affect PG&E Corporat ion’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows” below.)  In addition to such claims for property
damage, interest and attorneys’ fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expe nses, personal injury damages, and other
damages under other theories of liability, including if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have
a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation a nd the Utility.  Further, the Utility could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any other law
enforcement agency brought an enforcement action and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

27

Give n the preliminary stages of investigations and the uncertainty as to the causes of the fires, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe a loss is probable
at this time.  However, it is reasonably possible that facts could emerge through the course of the various investigations that lead PG&E Corporation and the Utility
to believe that a loss is probable, resulting in an accrued liability in the future, the amount of which could be material.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently
are unable to re asonably estimate the amount of losses (or range of amounts) that they could incur, given the preliminary stages of the investigations and the
uncertainty regarding the extent and magnitude of potential damages.  On January 31, 2018, the California Departm ent of Insurance issued a press release
announcing an update on property losses in connection with the October and December wildfires in California, stating that, as of such date, “insurers have received
nearly 45,000 insurance claims totaling more than $1 1.79 billion in losses,” of which approximately $10 billion relates to statewide claims from the October 2017
wildfires.  The remaining amount relates to claims from the Southern California December 2017 wildfires.  According to the California Department o f Insurance,
as of the date of the press release, more than 21,000 homes, 3,200 businesses, and more than 6,100 vehicles, watercraft, farm vehicles, and other equipment were
damaged or destroyed by the October 2017 wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Util ity have not independently verified these estimates.  The California
Department of Insurance did not state in its press release whether it intends to provide updated estimates of losses in the future.

If the Utility’s facilities are determined to be the c ause of one or more of the Northern California wildfires, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for
the related property losses and other damages.  The California Department of Insurance January 31, 2018 press release reflects insured property l osses only.  The
press release does not account for uninsured losses, interest, attorneys’ fees, fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury and
wrongful death damages or other costs.  If the Utility were to be found liable f or certain or all of such other costs and expenses, the amount of PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability could be higher than the approximately $10 billion estimated in respect of the wildfires that occurred in October 2017,
depending on the extent of the damage in connection with such fire or fires.  As a result, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

PG&E Corporation and t he Utility also are the subj ect of a still increasing number of lawsuits that have been filed against PG&E Corporation and the Utility in
Sonoma, Napa and San Francisco Counties’ Superior Courts, several of which seek to be certified as class actions.  The lawsuits allege, among other things,
negligence, inverse condemnation, trespass, and private nuisance.  They principally assert that PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to maintain
and repair their distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the fires.  The
plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and
other damages.  In ad dition, two derivative lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court on
November 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respectively. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to be the subject o f additional lawsuits in connection with the
Northern California wildfires.  The wildfire litigation could take a number of years to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters, including the ongoing
investigation into the causes of the fires and the growing number of parties and claims involved.  The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which
provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Northern California wildfires in an aggregate amount of approximately $800 million.  If the Utility
were to be found liable for one or more fires, the Utility’s insurance could be insufficient to cover that liability, depending on the extent of the damage in
connection with such fire or fires.

In addition, it could take a number of years before the Utility’s final liability is known and the Utility could apply for cost recovery.  The Utility may be unable to
recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number
of years thereafter to collect.  Further, SB 819, introduced in the California Senate in January 2018, if it becomes law, would prohibit utilities from recovering costs
in excess of insurance resulting from damages c aused by such utilities’ facilities, if the CPUC determines that the utility did not reasonably construct, maintain,
manage, control, or operate the facilities.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have considered certain actions that might be taken to attemp t to address liquidity
needs of the business in such circumstances, but the inability to recover costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a
timely manner, or any negative assessment by the Utility of the likel ihood or timeliness of such recovery and collection, could have a material adverse effect on
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.  (See “If the Utility is unable to recover all or a sign
ificant portion of its excess costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires and the Butte fire through ratemaking mechanisms, PG&E Corporation’s and
the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be m aterially affected” below.)

Losses in connection with the wildfires would likely require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to seek financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable
to PG&E Corporation or the Utility, or at all, when required.  (See “Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Requirements” below.)

28

As of December 31, 2017, neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility has accrued a liability with respect to the Northern California wildfires. If PG&E Corporation
and the Utility were to determi ne that it is both probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, a liability would be recorded
consistent with applicable accounting principles and as described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial S tatements in Item 8.  As noted above, to
the extent that such determination is made and a liability is accrued with respect to the Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability accrual may be
substantial. To the extent not offset by insurance recoveries determined to be similarly probable and estimable, the liability would reduce the balance sheet equity
of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, which could adversely impact the Utility’s ability to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure of 5 2% equity and 48%
debt and preferred stock, and which could also adversely impact PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings and their ability to declare and pay dividends,
efficiently raise capital, comply with financial covenants, and meet finan cial obligations.  (See “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results will be
affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings” below.)

Uncertainties relating to and market percept ion of these matters and the disclosure of findings regarding these matters over time, also could continue or increase
volatility in the market for PG&E Corporation’s common stock and other securities, and for the securities of the Utility, and materially affect the price of such
securities.

ion
with
the
Butte
fire.

In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.   On April 28, 2016, Cal
Fire   released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire.  According to Cal Fire’s report, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in two
fatalities, destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commer cial properties, and damaged 44 structures.  Cal Fire’s   report concluded that the wildfire was
caused when a gray pine tree contacted   the Utility’s   electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility   and/or its
vegetation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc.,   to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to
the failure of the tree.

In connection with the Butte fire, complaints have been filed against t he Utility, currently involving approximately 3,770 individual plaintiffs representing
approximately 2,030 households and their insurance companies.  Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on the doctrine of inverse
condemnati on and negligence theory of liability.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages.  The number of individual complaints and plaintiffs may still increase in
the future , because the statute of limitations for property damages in connection with the Butte fire h as not yet expired.   (The statute of limitations for personal
injury in connection with the Butte fire has expired.)   The Utility continues mediating and settling cases.

In addition, on April 13, 2017, Cal Fire filed a complaint seeking to recover $87 milli on for its costs incurred in connection with the Butte fire , and in May 2017,
the OES indicated that it intends to bring a claim against the Utility that the OES estimated in the approximate amount of $190 million.  Also, in June 2017, the
County of Calave ras indicated that it intends to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimates in the approximate amount of $85 million.

In connection with th is matter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through the
doctrine of inverse condemnation.  In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were
found to have been negligent.  While the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court or jury would agree with the Utility.

The Utility currently believes that it is probabl e that it will incur a loss of at least $1.1 billion , increased from the $750 million previously estimated as of
December 31, 2016 in connection with the Butte fire.  W hile this amount includes the Utility’s assumptions about fire suppression costs (includ ing its assessment
of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any significant portion of the estimated claims from the OES and the County of Calaveras.  The Utility still does not have
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the probable loss it may have for these additional claims.   A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could
result in an adjustment that could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flo
ws.   (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Through December 31, 2017, the amounts accrued in connection with claims relating to the Butte fire have exceeded the Utility’s liability insurance coverage.
While the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting approval to establish a WEMA to track wildfire expenses and to preserve the opportunity for the
Utility to request recovery of wildfire costs that have not otherwise been recovered through insurance or other mechanisms, the Utility cannot predict the outcome
of this proceeding.  (See “ Regulatory Matters – Application   to Establish a Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account” in Item 7. MD&A.)

29

In addition, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs recorded in WEMA, if approved, in the future. While the CPUC previously
approved WEMA tracking accounts for San Diego Gas & Electric Company in 2010, in December 2017, the CPUC den ied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas
& Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not
relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard .  That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern
California Edison.

Additionally, SB 819 introduced in the California Senate in January 2018, i f it becomes law, would prohibit utilities’ recover y of costs in excess of insurance
resulting from damages caused by such utilities’ facilities, if the CPUC determines that the U tility did not reasonably construct, maintain, manage, control, or
operate the facilities.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility hav e considered certain actions that might be taken to attempt to address liquidity needs of the business in such circumstances,
but the inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collec ting such rates in a timely manner, or
any negative assessment by the Utility of the likelihood or timeliness of such recovery and collection, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The
doctrine
of
inverse
condemnation,
if
applied
by
courts
in
litigation
to
which
PG&E
Corporation
or
the
Utility
are
subject,
could

’s
and

condition,

California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California for wildfire damages. Inverse condemnation imposes strict
liability (including liability for attorneys’ fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities’ electric
transmission lines.  Courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inv erse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the
grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from
such unde rtaking , and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers.  Plaintiffs have asserted the doctrine of
inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to the Northern California and Butte fires, and it is possib le that plaintiffs could be successful in convincing courts to
apply this doctrine in these or other litigations. For example, o n June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento found that the doctrine of inverse
condemnation applies to the Utility with respect to the Butte fire.  Although the Utility has filed a renewed motion for a legal determination of inverse
condemnation liability , there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in its arguments that the doctrine of invers e condemnation does not apply in
the Butte fire or other litigation against PG&E Corporation or the Utility.

Furthermore, a court could determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, or
before a potential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC.  Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to
automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no guar antee that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery whether or not a previous court
decision imposes liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation.  I n December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &
Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not
relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard. That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern
California Edison.

I f PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damage under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but is unable to secure a cost recovery
decision from the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates , the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows of PG&E
Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the Northern California wildf ires.  (See “ PG&E
Corporation and the Utility also expect to be the subject of additional lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement
actions” and “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate
amount of third-party liability that the Utility incurs in connection with the Butte fire” above.)

Proceedings

The

is
subject
to
extensive
regulations
and
the
risk
of
enforcement
proceedings
in
connection
with
such
regulations,
PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
condition,
results
of

could
be
materially
affected
by
the
outcomes
of
the

investigative
enforcement
proceedings
against
the
Utility,
other
known
enforcement
matters,
and
other
ongoing
state
and
federal
investigations
and
requests
for
information
.

The
Utility
could
incur
material
costs
and
fines
in
connection
with
compliance
with
penalties
from
closed
investigations
or
enforcement
actions
or
in
connection
with
future
investigations,
citations,
audits,
or
enforcement
actions.

The Utility is subje ct to extensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement
proceedings in connection with such regulations.  The Utility could incur material charges, including fines an d other penalties, in connection with the ex parte OII,
safety culture OII, and the CPUC’s SED investigations, including the SED’s investigations of the Yuba City incident, which arose from a residential structure fire
in Yuba City, California, in January 2017, that resulted in the collapse of a house and injuries to two persons inside the house, or other current and future
investigations.   The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate.

The SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory
penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued.  The SED may, at its discretion, impose pen alties on a daily basis, or on less than
a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day.  The SED also has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of
the circumstances, including such factors as the gr avity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and the
good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation.  The SED also is required to consider th e appropriateness of
the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.  Historically, the SED has exercised broad discretion in determining whether violations are continuing
and the amount of penalties to be imposed.   While it is uncertain how th e CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such
fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity and results of operations.  (See Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations.  In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office
opened investigations into matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel.  The Utility also is unable to predict the
outcome of, or costs and expenses associate with, pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility.

If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalt ies and, in the event of a judg ment against
the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences.  For example, on April 9, 2015, the CP UC issued a decision in its investigative enforcement proceedings
against the Utility to impose total penalties of $1.6 billion on the Utility after determining that the Utility had committed numerous violations of laws and
regulations related to its natur al gas transmission operations (the “San Bruno Penalty Decision”).  The San Bruno Penalty Decision requires the SED to review the
Utility’s gas transmission operations (including the Utility’s compliance with the remedies ordered by the San Bruno Penalty De cision) and to perform annual
audits of the Utility’s record-keeping practices for a minimum of ten years.  The SED could impose fines on the Utility or require the Utility to incur unrecoverable
costs, or both, based on the outcome of these future audits.   Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could
negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to ch allenge
the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations.  (See also “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future
financial results could be materially affected by the conviction of the Utility i n the federal criminal proceeding and by the debarment proceeding” below.)

The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws,
regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy
requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construct ion, operating and maintenance practices; safety
and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and
environmental compliance.  For example, despite th e Utility’s system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines, carried out in an effort to address a self-reported
violation whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipeline rights-of-
way, the SED could impose fines on the Utility in the future based on the Utility’s failure to continuously survey its system and remove encroachments. CPUC
staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance wi th its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs.  The amount of
such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and cash flows.

PG&E
Corporation’s
and

could
be
materially

in
the
event
of
non-
compliance
with
the
terms
of
probation
and
by
the
outcome
of
the
debarment
proceedin
g.

On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San
Francisco, found the Utility guilty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceedin g and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity management
regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act.  On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility.  The court sentenced the
Utility to a five- year corpor ate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after
three years , a fine of $3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and communi ty service.

The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period.  As part of the probation, the Utility
has retained a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense.  The goal of the monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to
maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis.

The Utility could incur material costs and additional penalties , not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in
connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to costs resulting from recomme ndations of the monitor).

Since 2015, the Utility has also been the subject of a DOI inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement
and non-procurement contracts and programs , citing the San Bruno e xplosion , and indicating, as the basis for the inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping, poor
identification and evaluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB’s investigation.  On December 21, 2016, the Utility and the DOI entered into an
inter im administrative agreement that reflects the DOI’s determination that the Utility remains eligible to contract with federal government agencies while the DOI
determines whether any further action is necessary to protect the federal government’s business i nterests.  If the DOI determines that the Utility’s compliance and
ethics program is not generally effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct, the Utility may be required to enter into an amended administrative
agreement and implement remedial a nd other measures, such as a requirement that the Utility’s natural gas operations and/or compliance and eth ics programs be
supervised by one or more independent third- party monitor (s) .

The Utility’s conviction and the outcome of probation and the debarme nt proceeding could harm the Utility’s relationships with regulators, legislators,
communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management.   Further, they could
negatively affe ct the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example, by enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to
recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was f ound guilty.  They could also result in increased
regulatory or legislative scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility’s business is conducted or organized.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters
” in Item 7. MD&A.)

PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
results
primarily
depend
on
the
outcomes
of

regulatory
and
ratemaking
proceedings
and
the
Utility’s
ability
to
manage
its
operating
expenses
and
capital
expenditures
so
that
it
is
able
to
earn
its
authorized
rate
of
return
in
a
timely
manner.

As a regulated entity, the Utility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient
revenues to recover reasonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results
could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its
authorized ROE.  The outcome of the Utility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties;
potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regula tory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility’s
regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas
services.   Further, the inc reasing amount of Reliability Must Run ( “ RMR ” ) electric generation in the CAISO could increase the Utility’s costs of procuring
capacity needed for reliable service to its customers .

32

In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s an d the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs to
safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs.  The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing ma rket
circumstances, unanticipated events (such as storms, fires, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), or compliance with new
state laws or policies.  Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of t he additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the
Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs.  Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that
they determine wer e not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility.

The Utility also   is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a
state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy
efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-sp eed rail project.  The
Utility’s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the
final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whethe r the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect a lower customer demand
for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas services .

PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
results
depend
upon
the
Utility’s
continuing
ability
t
o
recover
“pass-through”
costs,
including
electricity
and
natural
gas
procurement
costs,
from
customers

in
a
timely
manner.

The
CPUC
may
disallow
procurement
costs
for
a
variety
of
reasons.

In
addition,
the
Utility’s
ability
to
recover
these
costs
could
be
affected
by
the
loss
of
Utility
customers
and
decreased
new
customer
growth
,
if
the
CPUC
fails
to
adjust
the
Utility’s
rates
to
reflect
such
events.

The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity gen erated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricity
provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.   The Utility must manage these sources using the
commercial and CPUC regulatory p rinciples of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-
approved long-term procurement plan.  The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the U tility did not
comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.

Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety
of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower
customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility’s cus tomers to other retail providers.   In particular, the Utility will incur additional
costs to procure renewable energy to meet the higher targets established by California SB 350 that became effective on January 1, 2016.  Despite the CPUC’s
current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet
the CPUC reasonableness standard.

The Utility’s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesa le electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues
to function effectively.  Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and so
ftware on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.   The CPUC could prohibit the Utility
from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers.  For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in
California’s then-newly established wholesale electricity market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through
customer rates, ultimately causing the Utility to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through
municipalization of the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of
consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers.  (See “Competitio n in the Electricity Industry” in Item 1.)  As the number of
bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase
as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs.  Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable
charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these
costs.  In addition, the Utility’s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups.  Furthermore, if
the former customers return to receiving electrici ty supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to
timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all.

33

In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-
generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers.  New rules and rates became
effective for new NEM customers of the Utility in December 2016.  New NEM customers are required to pay an interconnection fee, comply with time of use
rates, and are required to pay certain non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the cos ts of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other
customers pay.  Remaining customers may incur significantly higher bills due to an increase in customers seeking alternative energy providers .   The CPUC has
indicated that it intends to revi sit these rules in 2019.

A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a
viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission,
and distribution investments.  If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of author ized capital
investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings.  Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to
customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technolog y, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-
generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial
condition, results of operat ions, liquidity, and cash flows.

The CPUC has begun to implement rate reform to allow residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of providing service and decrease
cross -subsidization among customer classes.  Many aspe cts of rate reform are not yet finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose a
fixed charge on certain customers.

Further, c hanges in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recov er its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE.
Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise in
commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs.
To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.

If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of changing
loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the d evelopment of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected .

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity is dependent on many factors, including a ccess to the capital markets and availability under their revolving credit
facilities and commercial paper program s .  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital markets, t he ability t o borrow under their loan
financing arrangements, including their revolving credit facilities, and the terms and rates of future financings, as well as the credit ratings of PG&E Corporation
and the Utility and their respective debt facilities, could be materially affected by the outcome or market percep tion of the matters discussed in this 2017 Form 10-
K under “Northern California Wildfires” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .  Liabilities that could be incurred as a result
of the Northern California wildfires could adversely affect their ability to comply with the covenants in their financing arrangements, which could adversely affect
the ability to borrow under the applicable facility or program.

Access by PG&E Corporation to the equity capital markets is also critical to maintaining the Utility’s CPUC-authorized capital structure. PG&E Corporation
contributes equity to t he Utility as needed to maintain the Utility’s CPUC-author ized capital structure.   In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, PG&E
Corporation issued $ 416 million in common stock and made equity contributions of $ 455 million to the Utility .   PG&E Corporatio n forecasts it will need a
material am ount of equity in future years, including to support the Utility’s capital expenditures.   PG&E Corporation may also seek to issue additional equity to
fund unrecoverable operating expenses and to pay claims, losses, fin es and penalties that may be   required by the outcome of enforcement matters and litigation,
including in connection with the Northern California wildfires, and the outcome of the related CPUC and Cal Fire investigations.

If either PG&E Corporation or the Utility is unable to access the capital markets or to borrow under their respective loan financing arrangements or commercial
paper program s , PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, could be materially affected.

PG&E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own.   The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations,
including the Utility’s obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends , unless suspended, and
meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&E Corporation . Under the CPUC’s rules applicable to utility holding
companies, the Utility’s dividend policy must be established by the Utility’s Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and
PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors must give “first priority” to the Utility’s capital requirements, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the
Utility’s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner.  The CPUC has interpreted this “first priority” obl igation to include the
requirement that PG&E Corp oration “infuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve . ”  In addition, before the
Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&E Corp oration , the U tility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equity component.

If the Utility were required to pay a material amount of fines or incur material unrecoverable costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires , the Butt e
fire , the pending CPUC investigations, the terms of probation or monitorship, or other liabilities or enforcement matters, it would require incremental equity
contributions from PG&E Corporation to restore its capital structure.  PG&E Corp oration common s tock issuances used to fund such equity contributions could
materially dilute earnings per share. (See “Liquidity and Financ ial Resources” in Item 7. MD&A ).  Further, if PG&E Corp oration were required to infuse the
Utility with significant capital or if the Utility w ere unable to distribute cash to PG&E Corporation , or both, PG&E Corporation may be unable to pay principal
and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend or meet other obligations.

In December 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended dividends on common stock of PG&E Corporation and preferred stock
of the Utility due to uncertainty related to the causes and potential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires.  The suspens ion of dividends could
continue to materially affect the price of PG&E Corporation’s common stock and adversely affect the ability of PG&E Corporation to raise additional equity
capital.  There can be no assurances as to when, if at all, the Board of Direct ors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility will determine to re-instate quarterly cash
dividends on PG&E Corporation’s common stock or the Utility’s preferred stock.

PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
results
will
be
affected
by
their
ability
to
continue
accessing
the
capital
markets
and
by
the
terms
of
debt
and
equity
financings.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to seek funds in the capital and credit markets to enable the Utility to make capital investments, and to pay fines
that may be imposed in the future, as well as costs related to rights-of-way and legal and regulatory costs.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access
the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend primarily o n PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings and outlook.
Their credit ratings and outlook can be affected by many factors, including pending or anticipated litigation, the pending Cal Fire and CPUC investigations and
CPUC ratemaking proceedings, and by the December 20, 2017 decision of the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to suspend dividends, as
well as the perceived impact of all such matters on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, whether or not such perception is accurate.  On
December 21, 2017, Moody's Investor Services and on December 22, 2017, S tandard & P oor’s Global Ratings, each placed all of the ratings of PG&E
Corporation and the Utility under review for downgrade , and Standard & Poor’s Globa l Ratings additionally lowered its ratings on the Utility’s preferred stock .
If PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s credit ratings were to be downgraded or the ratings on the Utility’s preferred stock are further downgraded, in particular to
below investm ent grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer
financing options, including reduced, or lack of, access to the commercial paper market and additional collater al posting requirements, which in turn could affect
liquidity and lead to an increased financing need.  Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal
or state regulatory environment affec ting energy companies generally or PG&E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry,
an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, and general economic and financial market conditions.

The reputations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to suffer from the negative publicity about matters discussed under “Enforcement and Litigation
Matters” in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .  The negative publicity and the uncertainty
about the outcomes of these matters may undermine confidence in management’s ability to execute its business strategy and restore a constructive regulatory
environment, which could adversely impact PG&E Corporati on’s stock price.  Further, the market price of PG&E Corporation common stock could decline
materially depending on the outcome of these matters.   The amount and timing of future share issuances also could affect the stock price.

The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating
system .  (See “Electric Utility Operations” and “Nat ural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. Business.)  The Utility’s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on
its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes
substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated to
decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives , and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025
.  The Utility’s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond th
e Utility’s control, including those that arise from:

the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause
explosions, fires, or other catastrophic eve nts;

an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operating
procedures, or welding or fabrication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets and
uncontained natural gas flow;

the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas
outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life;

a prolonged statewide electric al black-out that results  in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third
parties;

the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for emplo yees or the public, environmental
damage, or reputational damage;

the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;

the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, o r the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built;

the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably
should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion) ;

inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or
extended outages;

operator or other human error;

an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain
a utility system safely and prudently;

construction performed by thir d parties that damage s the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or
“dig-ins” that damage the Utility’s underground pipelines;

the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, in cluding, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-
based paint from the Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and

attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war.

36

The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating
output; damage the Utility’s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers
or others; and cause personal injury or death.  As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore se rvice, and to
compensate third parties.

Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the
construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties or
other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other
enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions.

Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requi rements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under
all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The Utility has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the Utility’s ordinary operations.
PG&E Corporation, the Utilit y or its contractors and customers may experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years.  No
assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility’s insurance coverage.  Uninsured losses a nd increases in the cost of insurance
may not be recoverable in customer rates.  A loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operatio ns, liquidity, and cash flows .

As a result of the potential application of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation , recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the
risk of increase of wildfires including as a result of t he ongoing drought, the Northern California wildfires, and the Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain
sufficient insurance coverage in the future at comparable cost and terms as the Utility’s current insurance coverage, or at all.  In addition, the Utility is unable to
predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.

Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility’s cur rent insurance coverage or may not be available at all.   If the
amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

the

The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned
generation and energy storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy.  California's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace
and scope of the industry change.  The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that suppo rt California's climate change and
GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers notwithstanding a recent change in the federal approach to such
matters.  California utilities are experiencing increasing deplo yment by customers and third parties of DERs, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel
cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies.  This growth will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other thing s,
accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid's capacity, and interconnect DERs.

In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy effi
ciency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and s tate infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water project s ).

37

To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distributi on grid in order to prepare for higher
penetration of DERs; consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs, and
if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities wo uld be appropriate for enabling those investments ; and clarify the role of the electr ic distribution grid
operator.  The CPUC has also recently opened proceedings regarding the   creation of a shared database or statewide census of utility poles and conduits in
California and increased access by communications providers to utility rights-of-way.   This proceeding could require utilities to invest significant resources into
inspecting poles and conduits, limit available capacity in existing rights-of-way, or im pose other requirements on utilities facilities.   The Utility is unable to
predict the outcome of these proceedings.

In addition, the CPUC has held discussions on potential changes to California’s electricity market.  On May 19, 2017, California energy companies, along with
other stakeholders , discussed customer choice and the future of the state’s electricity industry at a CPUC “en banc” meeting.   Specifically, the goal of the “en
banc” was to frame a discussion on the trends that are driving change wit hin California’s electricity sector and overall clean-energy economy and to lay out
elements of a path forward to ensure that California achieves its reliability, affordability, equity, and carbon reduction imperatives while recognizing the important
role that technology and customer preferences wil l play in shaping this future.  While the CPUC had indicated its intent to open a proceeding related to customer
choice, the Utility is unable to predict whether that remains the CPUC’s intent or the timing of an y such proceeding.

The industry change, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments an d initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility’s
inability to successful ly ada pt to changes in the electric industry, could mater ially affect the Utility’s operations, financial condition , and results of operations.

The Utility’s electricity and natural gas sys tems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication
technologies, which can be damaged by natural events—such as severe weather or seismic events—and by malicious events, such as cyber and ph ysical   attacks.
Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation , and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of
Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attac ks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude,
and frequency.  The Utility’s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with
new technologies and control systems.  Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility’s operational networks could cause harm to the public or
employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility’s ability   to safely generate, transport, deli ver and store energy and gas or otherwise
operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties.

The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it t o create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information,
including the Utility’s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their
dependents, contractors, and other individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems , and to
provide other services to the Utility or the Utility’s customers.  These third-party vendors could c ease to exist,   fail to establish adequate processes to protect the
Utility’s systems and information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures .   Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility’s information
technology systems could impa ct the Utility’s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting .

The Utility and its third party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthori zed access to the Utility’s
information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility’s operations.   None of these
attempts or breaches has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition and results of operations.   Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to preve nt the
unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations.  Such events could subject the Utility to
significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory
actions that could result in fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reputation, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition and results of operations.

The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents .  However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance wi ll
continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by
insurance or recoverable in rates.

The
operation
and

of

Utility’s
nucle
ar
generation
facilities

The operation of the Utilit y’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as
risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity,
natural disaster, or terrorist act.  If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could
have a material effect on PG&E Corpor ation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows .  In addition, the Utility may be
required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but
at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.   (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon un its by 2024 and 2025.  However, the Utility continues to face public concern about
the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel.  Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the
actions o f the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power.  Although an action in opposition may ultimately
fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete.  It is also possi ble that public pressure could grow leading to adverse
changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation.  As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease
before the ir respective license s expire in 2024 and 2025.  In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its
unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and cash flows.

In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur
costs in connection with (i) an employe e retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development
program,   to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the company .   In its January 11,
2018 decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $211.3 million (compared with the $352.1 million requested by the Utility) for an employee retention
program , but there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under such program .

The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.   (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.
Business.)   If the Utility were unable to re cover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.   The Utility may
determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may
order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.   The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases
operations at Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear generation units befor e their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025.  At December 31, 2017, the Utility’s
unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion.

On June 28, 2016 the California State Lands Commission approved an extension of the Utility’s leases of c oastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge
structures for the nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon, to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon’s current operating licenses.  The Utility will be required to
obtain an additional lease extension from the State Lands Commission to cover the period of time necessary to decommission the facility.  The State Lands
Commission and California Coastal Commission will evaluate appropriate environmental mitigation and development conditions associated with the
decommissioning project, the costs of which could be substantial.

The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at
the end of the ir useful lives.   (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statement in Item 8.)   The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nu clear facilities through nuclear decommissioning
charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.   If the
Utility’s actual decommissioning costs, includin g the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

Westinghouse.

If

proceedings
or
its

the
Utility
could

supply,

and

in
connection
with

its

Diablo
Canyon
outages

and
refuelings.

The   Utility   purchases its nuclear fuel assemblies   for Diablo Canyon   from a sole source, W estinghouse.   The   Utility   also stores nuclear fuel inventory   at
the   Westinghouse   fuel fabrication facilit y.   In addition,   Westinghouse   provides the   Utility   with   Diablo Canyon   outage support services, nuclear fuel
analysis, original equipment manufacturer engineering and parts support.     On March 29, 2017, Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 protection in the Unit ed States
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.   On January 4, 2018, Westinghouse announced that it has agreed to be acquired by Brookfield Business
Partners L.P. Westinghouse also indicated that its acquisition by Brookfield is expected to clos e in the third quarter of 2018, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval
and customary closing conditions including, among others, regulatory approvals.   In the event   that   Westinghouse experiences business disruptions   in its
nuclear fuel business as a result o f bankruptcy proceedings, its pending acquisition by Brookfield, or otherwise, the Utility could experience issues with its nuclear
fuel supply and   delays in connection with   Diablo Canyon refueling   outages.

Diablo Canyon’s Unit 2 refueling outage will oc cur in the first quarter of 2018 and the required fuel for that outage has been delivered.   The next Unit 1 refueling
outage is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019 and the fuel for that outage has not yet been fabricated.   If Westinghouse were t o fail to deliver nuclear fuel
or provide   outage support to the Utility, the   Utility’s operation of   Diablo Canyon   would be adversely affected.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility   also could
experience additional costs, including decreased electricity market revenues, in the event that   one or both   Diablo Canyon   units are unable to operate.   There
can be no assurance that any such additional costs would be recoverable in the rates the   Utility   is permitted to recover from its customers.     Furthermore, the
Utility currently is not able to   estimate the nature or amount of additional costs and expenses that it might incur in connection with the uncertainties surrounding
Westinghouse but such costs and expenses could be material.

For
certain
critical
technologies,
pr
oducts
and
services,
the
Utility
relies
on
a
limited
number
of
suppliers
and,
in
some
cases,
sole
suppliers.

In
the
event
these
suppliers
are
unable
to
perform,
the
Utility
could
experience
delays
and
disruptions
in
its
operations
while
it
transitions
to
alternative
plans
or
suppliers.

The Utility relies on a limited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services.   Although the Utility has long-term
agreements with such suppliers, if the suppliers are unable to deliver these technologies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions
while it implements alternative plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers.   As a result, the Utility’s business, financial conditi on, and
results of operations could be significantly affected.   As an example, the Utility relies on Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliers
of proprietary SmartMeter™   devices and software, and of managed services, utilized in its advanced metering system that collects electric and natural gas usage
data from customers.     If these suppliers encounter performance difficul ties or are unable to supply these devices or maintain and update their software, or
provide other services to maintain these systems, the Utility’s metering, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted.

Extreme weather, extended drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. Environmental
extremes, such as drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth ( which then fuel any fires ) and influence both
the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events.   In Ca lifornia, over the past five years, inconsistent and extreme precipitation, coupled with more hot
summer days, have increased the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficult to manage.   In particular, the risk posed by wildfires has inc
reased in the Utility’s service area (the Utility has approximately 82,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and 18,000 transmis sion overhead circuit miles) as a
result of an extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest a nd wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall following the drought,
among other environmental factors. Other contributing factors include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices.  The combined effects
of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk.

Severe weather events , including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic
events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, c ould result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life,
significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  Any such event could ha ve a material
effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business , financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows .   If the Utility is unable to recover its
wildfire costs, due to the reasons described in the risk factors related t o the Northern California fires, Butte fire, the doctrine of inverse condemnation, and
insurance limitations above, or for other reasons, its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

40

Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the
Utility’s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant.  Scientists project that
climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather.  As a result, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation could change
and the Utility would need t o consider managing or acquiring additional generation.   If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to
replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comp ly with GHG emissions limits. In
addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility’s facilities, including generation and electric transmission and distribution assets.  The
Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace f acilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries.  The
Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-r ecovery may
increase.

Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lower
revenues or incr eased expenses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change,
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows cou ld be materially affected.

The
Utility’s
operations
are
subject
to
extensive
environmental
laws
and
changes
in
or
liabilities
under
these
laws
could
adversely
affect
PG&E
Corporation’s
and
the
Utility’s
financial
results.

The Utility’s operations are su bject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and
usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife.  The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and
other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations.  The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future,
required to pay for environmental remediation costs a t sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws.
Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of
contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other pote ntially responsible parties.  (For more information,
s ee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more
expansive application of existing environmental regulations.  Failure to compl y with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or
permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other
sanction s.

The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms.  One of these
mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review.  The
CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has
authorized the Utility to recover in ra tes.

Some of the Utility’s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates
or insurance.  (See “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1. and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s costs to
remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to
have, a material effect o n PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated
costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.

State
climate
policy
requires
reductions
in
greenhouse
gases
of
40%
by
2030
and
80%
by
2050.

Various
proposals
for
addressing
these
reductions
have
the
potential
to
reduce
natural
gas
usage
and
increase
natural
gas
costs.
The
future
recovery
of
the
increased
costs
associated
with
compliance
is
uncertain.

The CARB is the state’s primary regulator for GHG emission reduction programs.   Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB’s Cap-and-
Trade Program since 2015, and natural gas end-use customers have an inc reasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost will
be reflected in customer bills.  CARB’s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas.   These include more aggressive
energy eff iciency programs to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, and
replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand.   The se natural gas load reductions may be partially offset by
CARB’s proposals to deploy natural gas to replace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications.   CARB also proposes a displacement of
some conventional natural gas with above- market renewable natural gas.   The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas
customer bills and a potential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk.

Other
Risk
Factors

The
Utility
may
be
required
to
incur
substantial
costs
in
order
to
obtain
or
renew
licenses
and
permits
needed
to
operate
the
Utility’s
business
and
the
Utility
may
be
subject
to
fines
and
penalties
for
failure
to
comply
or
obtain
license
renewal.

The Utility must c omply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued
operation of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, st ate and local governmental agencies.  Many of
the Utility’s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other
governmental permits.  These permits, authorizatio ns, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays.  Further, existing permits and
licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed whe n they were issued.  In
addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation
facility.

If a license or permit is not renewed for a particul ar facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment
charge or other costs.  Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Uti lity’s compliance
costs.  In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new
license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expen ditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility.

In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has no t
been previously required to obtain.

The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial conditio n, results of operations, and cash flows.  If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary
governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated complian ce and other
costs in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

Poor

d
the
Utility
to
make
significant
unplanned
contributions
to
its
pension
plan,
other
postretirement
benefits
plans,
and
nuclear
decommissioning
trusts.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit s for eligible employees and retirees.  The Utility also
maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value
of plan assets and trust assets.  A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts.  The cost of providing pension and
other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimu m funding levels, the rate of return on
plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government
regulation, and prior contributions to the plans.  Similarl y, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust
assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptio ns or
forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment.  (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  If the Utility is requi red to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and
postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the
contributions or addit ional costs in rates, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be
materially affected.

The Utility’s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years.  Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to
recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel.  The majority of the Utility’s
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions.  Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew
the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members.  In addition, some of the remaining non-represented
Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future.

42

PG&E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the
reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceed ings.  Any such occurrences could negatively impact
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition and results of operations.

The Utility owns or has obtained the right to occupy and/or use real property comprising the Utility's electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, natural gas
gathering facilities and generation facilities, and natural g as and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item 1. Business, under “Electric Utility
Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations.”  The Utility occupies or uses real property that it does not own primarily through various leases , easements,
rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities.  In total, the Utility occupies 11 million square fe et of real property,
including 9 million square feet owned by the Utility.  The Utility's corporate he adqu arters comprises approximately 1.7 million square feet located in several
Utility-owned buildings in San Francisco, California.

PG&E Corporation also leases approximately 42,000 square feet of office space from a third party in San Francisco, Californ ia.  This lease will expire in 2022.

The Utility currently owns approximately 160 ,000 acres of land, including approximately 132 ,000 acres of watershed lands.  In 2002 the Utility agreed to
implement its “Land Conservation Commitment” (“LCC”) to permanen tly preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through
conservation easements or equivalent protections, as well as to make approximately 70,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified
organizations.  Th e six “beneficial public values” being preserved by the LCC include: natural habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation

Consolidated Financial Statement s in Item 8 and in Item 7. MD&A .

Order
Instituting
an
Investigation
into
the
Utility’s
Safety
Culture

On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility
prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards.  The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate the
Utility’s and PG&E Corporation’s organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and acc ountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record of
operations, including its record of safety incidents.  The CPUC authorized the SED to engage a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation and the preparation
of a report containing the SED’s a ssessment.

On May 8, 2017, the CPUC President released the consultant’s report , accompanied by a scoping memo and ruling.  The scoping memo establishes a second phase
in this OII in which th e CPUC will evaluate the safety recommendations of the consultant that may lead to the CPUC’s adoption of the recommendations in th e
report, in whole or in part.  This phase of the proceeding will also consider all necessary measures, including, but not limited to, a potential reduction of the
Utility’s return on equity until any recommendations adop ted by the CPUC are implemented.  On November 17, 2017, the CPUC issued a phase two scoping
memo and procedural schedule. The scoping memo directed the Utility and other parties to file testimony addressing a number of issues including adoption of the
safety recommendations from the consultant , the Utility’s implementation process for the safety recommendations of the consultant , the Utility’s Board of
Director’s actions and initiatives related to safety culture and the consultant’s recommendations , the Utility’s corrective action program , and the Utility’s response
to certain specified safety incidents that occurred in 2013 through 2015.   The Utility’s testimony was submitted to the CPUC on January 8, 2018 and stated that the
Utility agrees with all of the recommendations of   the consultant and suppor ts their adoption by the CPUC.  Other parties’ responsive testimony is due February
16, 2018, and the Utility’s rebuttal is due February 23, 2018.  On January 29, 2018, th e CPUC modified the procedural schedule to allow more time for parties to
better identify areas of agreement to reduce the number of issues that may require hearings.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding, including whether additional fines, penalties, or other ratemaking tools will
ultimately be adopted by the CPUC, and whether the CPUC will require that a portion of return on equity for the Utility be dependent on making safety progress as
the CPUC may def ine in this proceeding.

Diablo
Canyon
Nuclear
Power
Plant

The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant employs a “once-through” cooling water system that is regulated under a Clean Water Act permit issued by the Central
Coast Board. This permit allows the Di ablo Canyon power plant to discharge the cooling water at a temperature no more than 22 degrees above the temperature of
the ambient receiving water, and requires that the beneficial uses of the water be protected.     The beneficial uses of water in this reg ion include industrial water
supply, marine and wildlife habitat, shellfish harvesting, and preservation of rare and endangered species.     In January   2000, the Central Coast Board issued a
proposed draft cease and desist order alleging that, although the te mperature limit has never been exceeded, the Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant's discharge
was not protective of beneficial uses.

In October   2000, the Utility and the Central Coast Board reached a tentative settlement under which the Central Coast Board agreed to find that the Utility's
discharge of cooling water from the Diablo Canyon power plant protects beneficial uses and that the intake technology reflects the best technology available, as
defined in the federal Clean Water Act.     As part of the tent ative settlement, the Utility agreed to take measures to preserve certain acreage north of the plant and
to fund approximately $6   million in environmental projects and future environmental monitoring related to coastal resources.     On March   21, 2003, the Ce ntral
Coast Board voted to accept the settlement agreement.     On June   17, 2003, the settlement agreement was executed by the Utility, the Central Coast Board and
the California Attorney General's Office.     A condition to the effectiveness of the settlement a greement was that the Central Coast Board renew Diablo Canyon's
permit.

Ho wever, at it s July   10, 2003 meeting, the Central Coast Board did not renew the permit and continued the permit renewal hearing indefinitely.     Several
Central Coast Board members indicated that they no longer supported the settlement agreement, and the Central Coast Board requested a team of independent
scientists to develop additional information on possible mitigation measures for Central Coast Board staff.     In   2005, the Central Coast Board reviewed the
scientists' draft report recommending several such mitigation measures, but no action was taken .

In 2010, the California Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling to wers or other significant
measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%.  The policy also provided for an alternative
compliance approach for nuclear plants if certain criteria were met .  As required by the policy, the California Water Board appointed a committee to evaluate the
feasibility and cost of using alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon.  The committee’s consultant submitted its final report to the Cali
fornia Water Board in September 2014.  The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such as cooling
towers.

On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon Unit 1 by 2 024 and Unit 2 by 2025.  As a result of the planned retirement, the
California Water Board will no longer need to address alternative compliance measures for Diablo Canyon.  As required under the policy, the Utility paid an
annual interim mitigation fee be ginning in 2017, which it will continue to pay until operations cease in 2025.  Additionally, the Utility expects that its decision to
retire Diablo Canyon will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility and the Central Coast Boar d regarding the thermal component of the
plant’s once-through cooling discharge.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition or results of
operati ons.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND

RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

PG& E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and central
California.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and nat ural gas to customers.

The Utility’s base revenue requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case and by the FERC in its TO rate cases based on forecast costs.
Differences between forecast costs and actual costs can occur for numerous rea sons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the
cost of labor and materials.     Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.     Generally, differences
between a ctual costs and forecast costs affect the Utility’s ability to earn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings”
in Results of Operations below).     However, for certain operating costs, such as costs associated w ith pension and other employee benefits, the Utility is
authorized to track the difference between actual amounts and forecast amounts and recover or refund the difference through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues
and Costs that did not Impact Earnin gs” in Results of Operations below).     The Utility also collects revenue requirements to recover certain costs that the CPUC
has authorized the Utility to pass on to customers, such as the costs to procure electricity or natural gas for its customers.     Ther efore, although these costs can
fluctuate, they generally do not impact net income (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below).   See
“Ratemaking Mechanisms” in Item 1 for further discussion.

This is a combined report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities.  This
combined MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Note s to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8.

Beginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wildfires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte, Lake,
Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City (the “Northern California wildfires”).   According to the Cal Fire California Statewide
Fire Summary dated October 30, 2017, at the peak of the wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres, resulted in
43 fatalities, and destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures.   Subsequently, the number of fatalities increased to 44.

The fires are being investigated by Cal Fire and the CPUC , including the possible role of the Utility’s power lines and other facilities.  The Utility expects that Cal
Fire will issue a report or reports stating its conclusions as to the sources of ignition of the fires and the way that they progressed.  The CPUC’s SED is also
conducting investigations to as sess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules and regulations in fire impacted
areas.  According to information made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities, vegetation
management, and emergency preparedness and response.  It is uncertain when the investigations will be complete and whether Cal Fire will release any
preliminary findings before its investigation is complete.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow s could be materially affected by potential losses resulting
from the impact of the Northern California wildfires.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors .

Tax
Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
of
201
7

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax legislation commonly refer red to as the Tax Act.

Among other provisions, the Tax Act
reduces the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and elim inated bonus depreciation for utilities.

50

The Tax Act also required PG&E Corporation and the Utility to re-measure existing deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower federal tax rate.
During the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation , on a consolidated basis, recorded a one-time provisional tax expense of $147
million to reflect the transitional impacts of the Tax Act.  Of this amount, $83 million is attributable to the re-measurement of PG&E Corporation’s n et deferred
tax asset comprised primarily of net operating loss carry - forwards and compensation-related items.  The remaining $64 million is related to the re-measurement of
the Utility’s deferred taxes not reflected in authorized revenue requirements, such as  disallowed plant.  The Utility also recorded a provisional $5. 7 billion re-
measurement of its deferred tax balances ( related to flow-through and normalized timing differences for plant-related items ) which was offset by a change from a
net deferred income tax regulatory asset t o a net regulatory liability.   The net deferred income tax regulatory liability will be refunded to customers over the
regulatory lives of the related assets.  The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may materi ally vary from the above recorded amounts due to, among other
things, future regulatory decisions from the CPUC that could differ from the Utility’s determination of how the impacts of the Tax Act are allocated between
customers and shareholders.

As a r esult of the Tax Act, the Utility intends to file by the end of March 2018 (i) revised revenue requirements and rate base in its 201 7 GRC (for years 2018 and
2019) and 2015 GT&S rate case (for 2018) as well as a proposed implementation plan in connection t hereto, and (ii) revised revenue requirement and rate base
forecast in its 2019 GT&S rate case.  The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the CPUC decision i n connection with such filing s .

On an aggregate basis, t he Utility anticipates an annual reduction to revenue requirements of approximately $500 million starting in 2018 , and incremental
increase s to rate base of approximately $500 million in 2018 and $800 million in 2019 as a result of the Tax Act .  The estimated benefit to customer s is driven by
the lower federal income tax rate applied to future earnings and the return of excess deferred income taxes.  These benefits are partially offset by earnings on
higher rate base and lower tax benefits from flow-through items.

In addition to this reduction in future revenue requirements, the Tax Act is expected to accelerate when PG&E Corporation resumes paying federal taxes ,
primarily due to the elimination of bonus depreciation ; although future taxes are expected to be lower due to the lower federal tax rate.  PG&E Corporation now
expects to pay federal taxes starting in 2020 , although that timing would be impacted by any significant changes to future results of operations .  Add itionally,
because the revenue reduction is expected to precede the reduction in federal income tax payments, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating cash flows will
be negatively impacted resulting in additional financing needs.

Summary
of
Changes
in
Net
Income
and
Earnings
per
Share

The tables below include a summary reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s consolidated income available for common shareholders and EPS to earnings from
operations and EPS based on earnings from operations for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months and twelve
months ended December 31, 2016 and a summary reconciliation of the key drivers of PG&E Corporation’s earnings from operations and EPS based on earnings
from operations for th e three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 .
“ Earnings from operations ” is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as income availab le for common shareholders less items impacting comparability.
  “ Items impacting comparability ” represent items that management does not consider part of the normal course of operations and affect comparability of financial
results between periods.   PG&E C orporation uses earnings from operations to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various
purposes including internal b udgeting and forecasting, short and long-term operating plans, and employee incentive compensation .   PG&E Corporation believes
that earnings from operations provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business allowing for a better comparison against historical results and
expectations for future performance .  E arnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for GAAP measures such as income av ailable for common
shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Key
Factors
Affecting
Financial
Results

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity , and cash flows may be materiall y affected by the
following factors:

The
Impact
of
the
Northern
California
Wildfires
.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity , and cash
flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the Northern California wildfires.  The Utility incurred costs of $219
million for service restoration and repairs to the Utility’s facilities (includin g an estimated $97 million in capital expenditures) in connection with these
fires.  PG&E Corporation’s and t he Utility’s financial co ndition, results of operations, liquidity , and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility
is unable to recover such costs through CEMA.  If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the
cause of one or more fires , and the d octrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’
fees with out having been found negligent , which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial.  In addition to such claims, as well as c laims under
other theories of liability, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs , evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, and other
damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggreg ate, could be substantial and have a material effect on PG&E
Corporation and the Utility .   Further, the Utility also could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any other law enforcement agency
brought an enforcement action and determine d that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.   If the Utility were to determine that
it is both probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, a liability would be recorded consistent with the principles
discussed in Note 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 .  To the extent not offset by insurance recoveries, the liability would
affect the balance sheet equity of PG&E Corporation and the Utility .  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 1 3 to Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The
Applicability
of
the
Doctrine
of
Inverse
Condemnation
in
PG&E
Corporation
and
the
Utility’
s
Wildfire
Litigation.
The doctrine of inverse
condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential
shareholder liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’ s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity
and cash flows. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their
customers, there can be no guarantee that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery even if a court decision imposes liability under the doctrine of inverse
condemnation.  I n December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the
doctrine o f inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager
standard.  That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison.  (See
“Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The
Tax
Cut
and
Jobs
Act
.

O n December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax leg islation commonly referred to as the Tax Act .
Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminate s
bonus depreciation for utilities.  As a result of the Tax Act, beginning in 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility anticipate a reduction in revenues, lower
effective income tax rates and lower income tax expense .  In addition, the Utility expects a rate base increase primarily due to the elimination of bonus
deprecia tion.  (See “The Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017” and “Regulatory Matters” in this Item 7. MD&A and Note 3 and Note 8 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The
Outcome
of
Enforcement,
Litigation,
and
Regulatory
Matters.

The Utility’s financial results may continue to be impacted by the outcome of current
and future enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters, including the impact of the Northern California wildfires, the Butte fire, the safety culture OII
and any rela ted fines, penalties, or other ratemaking tools that could be imposed by the CPUC, including as a result of the phase two of the proceeding,
the ex parte OII and the related proposed decision, the potential recommendations that the third-party monitor ( ret ained by the Utility in the first quarter
of 2017 as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27, 2017 federal criminal conviction) may make, and potential
penalties in connection with the Utility’s safety and other self-re ports.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 , Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Item 1A. Risk Factors .)

The
Timing
and
Ou
tcome
of
Ratemaking
Proceedings.

The Utility’s financial results may be impacted by the timing and ou tcome of its 2019 GT&S rate
case, and FERC TO18 and TO19 rate cases, as well as the recent remand decision by the Ninth Circuit regarding an ROE adder for transmission facilities.
  (See “Regulatory Matters – 2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters − FERC Transmission Owner Rate Cases ” below
for more information.)  The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies, potentia l rate
impacts, the Utility’s reputation, the regulatory and political environments, and other factors.

The
Ability
of
the
Utility
to
Control
and
Recover
Operating
Costs
and
Capital
Expenditures.

In any given year the Utility’s ability to earn its author ized
rate of return depends on its ability to manage costs within the amounts authorized in rate case decisions.   The Utility forecasts that in 201 8 it will incur
unrecovered pipeline-relat ed expenses ranging from $35 million to $60 million which primarily relate to costs to identify and remove encroachments
from transmission pipeline rights-of-way.  Also, the CPUC decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case establishe d various cost caps that will increase
the risk of overspend over the rate case cycle th rough 2018. (See “Disallowance of Plant Costs” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidate d Financial
Statements in Item 8 .)

The
Amount
and
Timing
of
the
Utility’s
Financing
Needs.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the capital markets, ability to borrow
under its loan financing arrangements and the terms and rates of future financings could be materially affected by the outcome of, or market perception of,
the matters discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financi al Statements, including liabilities, if any, incurred in relation to the Northern
California wildfires, adverse effects on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio
covenants in their finan cing arrangements and regulatory capital structure requirements resulting therefrom, adverse changes in their respective credit
ratings, general economic and market conditions, and other factors.  PG&E Corporation contributes equity to the Utility as neede d to maintain the
Utility’s CPUC-au thorized capital structure.  In 201 7 , PG&E Corporation issued $416 mil lion of common stock and made equity contributions of $455
million to the Utility .  PG&E Corporation forecasts that it will need to continue to issue a material amount of equity in future years, primarily to support
the Utility’s capital expenditures.  PG&E Corporation may seek to issue additional equity to fund unrecoverable pipeline-related expenses and to pay
claims, losses, fines, and penalties that may be required by the outcome of litigation and enforcement matters.  Additional issuances of equity, if any,
could have a material dilutive impact on PG&E Corporation’s EPS.

Changes
in
the
Utility
Industry.

The Utility is committed to delivering safe, reliable, sustainable, and affordable electric and gas services to its
customers.  Increasing demands from state laws and policies relating to increased renewable energy resources, the reduction of GHG emissions, the
expansion of energy efficiency programs , the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, and the
development of energy storage technologies have increased pressure on the Utility to achieve efficiencies in its operations while continuing to pro vide
customers with safe, reliable, and affordable service.  The utility industry is also undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements
enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned gen eration and energy storage) and state c limate policy supporting a decarbonized economy.
California’s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change.  The electric grid is a critical enabler of the
adoption of new energy technologies that support Cali fornia's climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by
California policy makers notwithstanding a recent change in the fed eral approach to such matters.  In order to enable the California clean energy
economy, sust ained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy s torage options,
EV infrastructure and s tate infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water projects).   The Utility forecasts ove r $ 1 billion in gri d investments through
2020, which would include increased remote control and sensor technology of the grid, integration inv estments in connection with DER bi-directional
energy flows and voltage fluctuations , advanced grid data analytics, g rid storage that enables renewable integration, expanded infrastructure for light,
medium , and heavy-duty EVs, transmission integration for renewables, and energy efficiency and demand response programs.  In addition, these changes
brought about by technol ogical advancements and climate policy may cause a reduction in natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs.  The
combination of reduced natural gas load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and potential cost recovery risk.

For more information about the factors and risks that could affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity , and
cash flows, or that could cause future results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors .  In addition, this 201 7 Form 10-K contains forward-
looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions that are based on
current estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management's knowledge of facts as of the date of
this 2017 Form 10-K .  See the section entitled “Forwa rd - Looking Statements” below for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ
materially.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation t o update
forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.

PG& E Corporation’s net income consists primarily of income taxes, interest expense on long-term debt, and other income from investments.  The decrease in
PG&E Corporation’s net income for 2017, as compared to 2016 , is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act and interest expense, partially offset by the impact
of the San Bruno Derivative Litigation.  Results include approximately $30 million of realized gains and associated tax benefits related to an investment in
SolarCity Corporation recognized in 2015, with no corresponding gains in 2016 or 2017.

Utility

The table below shows certain items from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 .  The table separately identifies the revenues
and costs that impacted earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is author ized to pass through directly to customers (such
as costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recover
those pass-through costs, do not impact earni ngs.  In addition, expenses that have been specifically authorized (such as the payment of pension costs) and the
corresponding revenues the Utility is authorized to collect to recover such costs, do not impact earnings.

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assets
and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings a re primarily those that the Utility incurs
to own and operate its assets.

Utility
Revenues
and
Costs
that
Impacted
Earnings

The following discussion presents the Utility’s operating results for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for these
periods.

Operating
Revenues

The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $ 144 m illion , or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016 , primarily due to
higher electric transmission revenues .

The Utility’s electric and natura l gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $1.2 billion or 13% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result of
approximately $700 million of incremental revenues authorized in the 2015 GT&S rate case and approximately $425 million of addi tional base revenues as
authorized by the CPUC in the 2014 GRC decision and by the FERC in the TO 17 rate case.

58

Operating
and
Maintenance

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased $ 675 m illion , or 12% , in 2017 compared to 2016 .  In 2017, the Utility
incurred $4 55 million less in disallowed charges ( t he Utility recorded a $47 million disallowance related to the Diablo Canyon settlement in 2017 as compared to
$ 502 million of disallowed capital charges related to the San Bruno P enalty D ecision and 2015 GT&S rate case decision in 2016) and $ 447 million less in
charges related to the Butt e fire (the Utility recorded $ 410 million in charges in 2017 as compared to $ 857 million in 2016) .   These decreases were partially
offset by insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire decreasing by approximately $ 275 million (the Utility recorded $350 million in insurance recoveries in 2017
as compared to approximately $ 625 million in 2016).   ( S ee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $ 385 million , or 7% , in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to $857
million in charges for third-party claims, Utility clean-up, repair, and legal costs related to the Butte fire, $219 million in permanently disallowed capital spending,
$34 million in charges recorded in connection with the final CPUC decision related to the natural gas distribution facilities record-keeping investigation, the federal
criminal trial, and the atmospheric corrosion inspection self-report, $24 million in higher pipeline-re lated expenses and legal and regulatory related expenses
during 2016, an escalation related to labor, benefits, and service contracts, and accelerated transmission and distribution project work.  These increases were
partially offset by $500 million in cha rges associated with the San Bruno Penalty Decision for customer refunds and fines incurred in 2015 with no corresponding
charges in 2016 and approximately $125 million in lower disallowed capital charges associated with the San Bruno Penalty Decision in 2 016.  Additionally, the
Utility recorded approximately $576 million more in insurance recoveries (in 2016, the Utility recorded $625 million in insurance recoveries related to the Butte
fire as compared to $49 million of insurance recoveries for third-part y claims related to the San Bruno accident in 2015 ) .

T he Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the
Northern California wildfires and an y additio nal charges associated with costs related to the Butte fire.   (See Item 1A. Risk Factors above and Note 1 3 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. )

Depreciation,
Amortization,
and
Decommissioning

The Utility’s depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased $ 100 million , or 4% in 2017 compared to 2016 and $ 143 million , or 5% in
2016 compared to 2015 .  In 201 7 , the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions and higher depreciation rates as authorized by the CPUC in
the 2017 GRC .  In 201 6 , the increase was primarily due to the impact of capital additions.

Intere
st
Expense

The Utility’s interest expenses increased by $ 58 million, or 7% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.  The
Utility’s interest expenses increased by $ 56 million , or 7% in 201 6 compared to 201 5 , primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.

Interest
Income
and
Other
Income,
Net

There were no material changes to interest income and other in come, net for the periods presented.

Income
Tax
Provision

The Utility’s income tax provision increased $ 357 million in 2017 compared to 2016 .  The increase in the tax provision was primarily the result of the statutory
tax effect of higher pre-tax income in 201 7 compared to 201 6 and an adjustment required to record the change in deferred tax balances due to tax reform in 2017
with no comparable adjustment in 2016.   (For more information see “Tax Reform” below and Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The Utility’s income tax provision increased $89 million in 2016 compared to 2015.  The increase in the tax provis ion was primarily the result of the statutory tax
effect of higher pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by higher tax benefits from property-related timing differences in 2016 compared to
2015.  The higher effective tax rate was driven by higher pre-tax earnings in 2016, partially offset by rate impact from property-related timing differences.

(1) Includes the effect of state flow -through ratemaking treatment.  In 2016 and 2015, amounts reflect an agreement with the IRS on a 2011 audit related to electric transmission and distribution

repairs deductions.  The 2017 amount reflects an agreement with the IRS on a 2013 audit related to generation repairs deductions.

(2) I nclude s the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs a s authorized by the 2014 GRC decision in all periods presented and by the 2015 GT&S
decision which impacted 2016 and 2017.  All amounts are impacted by the level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC and 2015 GT&S rate case decisions authorized reve nue
requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these
temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utilit y recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation a nd the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or
liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates.

( 3 ) Primarily represen ts the effect s of a non-tax deductible penalty asso ciated with the Butte fire for 2017, non-tax deductible fines and penalties associated with the natural gas distribution

facilities record-keeping decision for 2016 and the effects of the San Bruno Penalty Decision for 2015 .

Utility
Revenues
and
Costs
that

Earnings

Fluctuations in revenues that did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs (see below for more detail).

Cost
of
Electricity

The Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its own
generation facilities, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade prog ram, and realized
gains and losses on price risk management activities.   (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s total purchased
power is driven by customer demand, the availability of the Utility’s own g eneration facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost-
effectiveness of each source of electricity .

Charge Indifference Adjustment OIR ”, below.

( 2) The decrease in purchased power for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due t o lower Utility electric customer demand and an increase in generation from hydroelectric facilities.

Cost
of
Natural
Gas

The Utility’s cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade
program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.   (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The
Utility’s cost of natural gas is impacted by the market price of natural gas, changes in the cost of storage and transportation, and changes in customer demand.

Operating
and
Maintenance
Expenses

The Utility’s operating expenses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred such as pension contributions
and public purpose programs costs.  If the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.  For 201 7 , 201
6, and 201 5 , no material amounts were incurred above authorized amounts.

LIQUIDITY
AND
FINANCIAL
RESOURCES

Overview

On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utili ty suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018,
due to the uncertaint y related to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires.  ( See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 13
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The Utility’s ability to fund operations , fi nance capital expenditures, and make distributions to PG&E Corporation depends on the levels of its operating cash
flows and access to the capital and credit markets.  The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capital structure, the aggregate amount of long-term a nd short-term debt that
the Utility may issue , and the revenue requirements the Utility is able to collect to recover its cost of capital.  The Utility generally utilizes equity contributions
from PG&E Corporation and long-term senior unsecured debt issuan ces to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt
and preferred sto ck.  (See “R egulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A. )   The Utility relies on short-term debt, including commercial paper, to fund temporary
financing ne eds.

PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund equity contributions to the Utility , and declare and pay
dividends primarily depends on the level of cash distributions received from the Utility and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.  PG&E
Corporation’s equity contributions to the Utility are funded primarily through common stock issuances.   PG&E Corporation has material stand-alone cash flows
related to the issuance of equity and long-term debt, and issuances and repayments under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.  PG&E
Corporation relies on short-term deb t, including commercial paper, to fund temporary financing needs.

61

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters, including the outcome
of the uncertainties and pot ential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires.  Credit rating downgrades may increase the cost and availability of
short-term borrowing, including commercial paper, the costs associated with credit facilities, and long-term debt cost s.  In addition, some of the Utility’s
commodity contracts contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies.   In December 2017,
following PG&E Corporation’s announcement that it was su spending its dividend due to the uncertainty related to the causes and potential liabilities associated
with the Northern California wildfires, all of the ratings of PG&E Corporation and the Utility were placed under review for downgrade by Moody’s Investo r
Services.  Additionally, in December 2017, Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings lowered the Utility’s preferred stock credit rating and placed all of the ratings of
PG&E Corporation and the Utility on CreditWatch with negative implications.  If the Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would
be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some of its net liability positions .  (See Note s 9 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.)

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s equity needs could increase materially and its liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected by potential costs and
other liabilities in connection with the Northern California wildfires.  T he Utilit y’s equity needs will also continue to be affected by the timing and amount of
disallowed capital expenditures, and by fines , penalties and claims that may be imposed in connection with the matters describe d in “Enforcement and Litigation
Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Fina ncial Statements in Item 8 .  In addition, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to access the
capital markets in a manner consistent with its past practices, if at all, could be adversely affected by such matt ers.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

As a result of the Tax Act, the Utility anticipates an annual reduction to revenue requirements of approximat ely $500 million starting in 2018.  In addition to this
reduction in future revenue requirements, the Tax Act’s other provisions, in particular the elimination of bonus depreciation, are expected to accelerate when
PG&E Corporation resumes paying federal taxes; although future taxes will be lower due to the lower federal tax rate.  PG&E Corporation now expects to pay
federal taxes starting in 2020 , although that timing would be impacted by any significant changes to future results of operations .  Additionally, because the
revenue redu ction is expected to precede the reduction in federal income tax payments, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating cash flows will be

In November 2017, the Utility issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due November 28, 2018.  The proceeds were use d towards repayment of the $250
million unsecured floating rate notes due November 30, 2017 and the balance was used to support the Northern California wildfire response efforts.

On January 9, 2018, the Utility sent a notice of redemption to redeem all $4 00 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% senior notes due October 15, 2018
on February 18, 2018.  On January 31, 2018, the Utility deposited with the trustee funds sufficient to effect the early redemption of these bonds and satisfy and
discharge its remaining obligation of $400 million.

Equity
Financings

In February 2017, PG&E Corporation amended its February 2015 EDA providing for the sale of PG&E Corporation common stock having an aggregate gross
price of up to $275 million.  During the tw elve months ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation sold 0.4 million shares of its common stock under the
February 2017 EDA for cash proceeds of $ 28.4 million, net of commissions paid of $ 0.2 million. There were no issuances under the February 2017 EDA for the
three months ended December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, the remaining gross sales available under this agreement were $ 246.3 million.

PG&E Corporation also issued common stock under the PG&E Corporation 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, and share-based
compensation plans.  During 2017, 7.4 million shares were is sued for cash proceeds of $ 366.4 million under these plans.

The proceeds from these sales were used for general corporate purposes, including the contribution of equity to the Utility .  For the year ended December 31, 2017
, PG& E Corporation made equity contributions to the Utility of $ 455 million.

Pollution
Control
Bonds

In June 2017, the Utility repurchased and retired $345 million principal amount of pollution control bonds Series 2004 A through D.  Additionally, in June 2017,
the Utility remarketed three series of pollution control bonds, previously held in treasury, totaling $145 million in principal amount.  Series 2008 F and 2010 E bear
interest at 1.75% per annum.  Although the stated maturity da te for Series 2008 F and 2010 E is November 1, 2026, these bonds have a mandatory redemption date
of May 30, 2022 .  Series 2008 G bears interest at 1.05% per annum and matures on December 1, 2018.

Revolving
Credit
Facilities
and
Commercial
Paper
Programs

In May 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility each extended the termination dates of their existing revolving credit facilities by one year from April 27, 2021 to
April 27, 2022.  At December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had $ 168 million and $ 2.9 billion available under their respective $ 300 million and
$3. 0 billion revolving credit facilities.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

PG&E Corporation and the Utility can issue commercial paper up to the maximum amounts of $300 million and $ 2.5 billion, respectively.  For the year ended
December 31, 201 7 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility had an average o utstanding commercial paper balance of $ 81 million and $ 469 million, and a maximum
outstanding balance of $ 161 million and $ 1.1 billion, respectively. At December 31, 201 7 , PG&E Corporation and t he Utility had outstanding co mmercial
paper balances of $ 132 million and $ 50 m illion , respectively.   (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consoli dated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

T he revolving credit facilities require that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of at
most 65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter.  A t December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s total consolidated debt to total consolidate d
capitalization was 50% and 49% , respectively .  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit facil ity agreement also requires that PG&E Corporation own s , directly or
indirectly, at least 80% of the common stock and at least 70% of the voting capital stock of the Utility.   In addition, the revolving credit facilities include usual and
customary provisions regarding events of default and covenants including covenants limiting liens to those permitted under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
senior note indentures, mergers, and imposing conditions on the sale of all or substantially all of PG&E C orporation’s and the Utility’s assets and other
fundamental changes.   A t December 31, 2017 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility were in compl iance with all covenants under their respective revolving credit
facilities.

Dividends

The Board of Directors of P G&E Corporation and the Utility each has the authority to declare dividends on PG&E Corporation’s common stock and the Utility’s
common and preferred stock, respectively.  Dividends are not payable unless and until declared by the applicable Board of Direc tors.  Each Board of Directors
retains authority to change the respective common or preferred stock dividend policy and dividend payout ratio or rate at any time, especially if unexpected events
occur that would change their view as to the prudent level of cash conservation.

PG&E
Corporation

For the first quarter of 201 7 , the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $ 0.49 per share. In May 2017 , the Board of
Directors of PG&E Corporation approved a new annual common stock dividen d of $ 2.12 per share.  As a result, for the second and third quarter s of 201 7 , the
Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0. 53 per share .  In 2017, total dividends declared were $ 1.55 per share.   For the
first q uarter of 2016, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.455 per share.  For each of the second, third and
fourth quarters of 2016, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.4 9 per share .  In 2016, total dividends declared

annual dividends of $1.82 per share.  Dividends paid to common shareholders by PG&E Corporation were $ 1.0 b illion in 2017, $ 921 million in 2016, and $ 856
million in 2015 .

Utility

For the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock dividend of $244 million to PG&E Corporation.  For the second and
third quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared common stock dividends of $270 million to PG&E Corporation.  In 2017, total dividends paid
by the Utility to PG&E Corporation were $ 784 million.  For the first quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock dividend of $
179 million to PG&E Corporation.  For each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2016, the Board of Directors of the Utility d eclar ed common stock
dividends of $ 244 million to PG&E Corporation .  In 2016, total dividends paid by the Utility to PG&E Corporation were $ 911 million.  For each of the quarters
in 2015 , the Board of Directors of the Utility declared common stock dividends of $ 179 million to PG&E Corporation for annual dividends paid of $ 716 million.
  In addition, the Utility p aid $ 14 million of dividends on preferred stock in each of 2017, 201 6, and 2015 .   The Ut ility’s preferred stock is cumulative and any
dividends in arrears must be paid before the Utility m ay pay any common stock dividends.

The Utility’s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as
depreciation that do not require the use of cash.  During 2017, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $ 1.6 billion compared to 2016.  This increase
was primarily due to additional electric and natural gas operating revenues collected as authorized by the CPUC in the 2015 GT&S rate cas e, the $400 million
refund to natural gas customers in the second quarter of 2016, as required by the San Bruno Penalty Decision (with no corresponding activity in 2017), and the
receipt of approximately $300 million of insurance recoveries related to the Butte fire in 2017 as compared to $50 million of insurance recoveries related to the
Butte fire during 2016.

64

During 2016 , net cash provided by operating activities in creased by $ 597 million compared to 2015 .  This in crease was partially due to the Utili ty receiving an
additional $170 million in tax refunds in 2016 as compared to 2015.  The remaining increase was primarily due to fluctuations in activities within the normal
course of business such as timing and amount of customer billings and vendor billi ngs and payments.

Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including:

the timing and amount of costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires, as well as potential liabilities in connection with third- party claims
and fines or penalties that could be imposed on the Utility if the CPUC or any other law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action and
determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations;

the timing and am ounts of costs , including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with the current and future enforcement, litigation, and
regulatory matters, including the impact of the Butte fire and the timing and amount of related insurance recoveries, the safety culture OII, including other
ratemaking tools that could be imposed by the CPUC as a result of the phase two of the proceeding, the ex parte OII and the related proposed decision,
costs associated with potential recommendations that the third-p arty monitor may make related to the Utility’s conviction in the federal criminal trial, and
potential penalties in connection with the Utility’s safety and other self-reports ;

the Tax Act, which is expected to accelerate the timing of federal tax payment s and reduce revenue requirements, resulting in lower operating cash flows;

the timing and outcome s of the 2019 GT&S, TO18, and TO19 rate cases and other ratemaking and regulatory proceedings ;

the timing and amount of costs the Utility incurs, but does n ot recover, associated with its electric and natural gas system s ; and

the timing of the resolution of the Chapter 11 disputed claims and the amount of principal and interest on these claims that the Utility will be required to
pay.

Investing
Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $124 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures.   Net cash
used in investing activities in creased by $ 315 million during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase of approximately $440 million in capital
expenditures, partially offset by an increase in restricted cash released from escrow by approximately $160 million.

Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely de pendent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur
approximately $ 6.3 billion in capital expenditures in 2018 and $6.0 billion in 2019 .

Financing
Activities

During 2017, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $ 1.1 billion as compared to 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to net commercial
repayments of $972 million in 2017 as compared to net rep ayments of $9 million in 2016.  During 2016 , net cash pro vided by financing activities de creased by $
274 million as compared to 2015 .  Cas h provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash
provided by or used in operating activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date
of existing debt instruments.  The Utility generally utilizes long-term debt issu ances and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to maintain its CPUC-
authorized capital structure, and relies on short-term debt to fund temporary financing needs.

(1) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt.  Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate at December 31, 2017 and outstanding principal for each instrument with the

terms ending at each instrument’s maturity.   (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

( 2) See “Purchase Commitments” and “Other Commitments” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
(3) See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements.  As these

annual requirements continue indefinitely into the f uture, the amount shown in the column entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utility’s pension and
other benefit plans.

( 4) Beginning with the three-month period ending January 31, 2018, quarterly cash dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock were suspended.   While the timing of cumulative dividend
payments is uncertain, it is assumed for the table above to be payable within a fixed period of five years based on historical performance.   ( S ee Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.)

The contractual commitments table above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions .  Due to the uncertainty surrounding tax audits,
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot make reliabl e estimates of the amount s and period s of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to
unrecognized tax benefits.  Matters relating to tax years that remain subject to examination are discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 .

O
ff-Balance
Sheet
Arrangements

PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material
effect on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources ,
other than those discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (the Utility’s commodity purchase agreements) in Item 8 .

ENFORCEMENT
AND
LITIGATION
MATTER
S

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigation
matters described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Legal Proceedings in Item 3 .   The outcome of these matters,
individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

66

R
EGULATORY
MATTERS

The Utility is subject to substantial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC , and other federal and state regulatory agencies.  The resolutions of these and
other proceedings may affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The Utility is still analyzing the impact of the Tax Act on revenue requirements and rate base for the 2017 GRC, the 2015 GT&S Rate Case, the recently submitted
2019 GT&S Rate C ase, and the pending TO19 rate case.  However, on an aggregate basis, the Utility currently anticipates an annual reduction to revenue
requirements of approximately $500 million starting in 2018, and incremental increases to rate base of approximately $500 million in 2018 and $800 million in
2019, as a result of the Tax Act.

As a result of the Tax Act, the Utility intends to file by the end of March 2018 (i) revised revenue requirements and rate base in its 2017 GRC (for years 2018 and
2019) and 2015 G T&S rate case (for 2018) as well as a proposed implementation plan in connection thereto, and (ii) revised revenue requirement and rate base
forecast in its 2019 GT&S rate case.  The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the CPUC decision in connection with such filings.  As discussed
below, the 2017 GRC final decision established a tax memorandum account to track revenue differences resulting from tax law changes, among other items, for
disposition in the 2020 GRC.  The March filing s will accelerate that timing.  (Se e “Tax Cut s and Jobs Act of 2017” in Item 7. MD&A and Note 3 and Note 8 in
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

2017
General
Rate
Case

On May 11, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Utility’s 2017 GR C, which determined the annual amount of base revenues (or “revenue requirements”)
that the Utility is authorized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs for electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and
ele ctric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return.  The final decision approved, with certain
modifications, the settlement agreement that the Utility, the ORA, TURN, and 12 other intervening partie s jointly submitted to the CPUC on August 3, 2016 (the
“settlement agreement”).  Modifications from the settlement agreement to the final decision included a tax memorandum account and approval of a stand-alone
application with the CPUC or a filing in the CPUC’s ongoing residential rate reform proceeding to recover customer outreach and other costs incurred as a result of
residential rate reform implementation.  The new tax memorandum account will track any revenue differences resulting from changes in inco me tax expense
caused by net revenue changes, mandatory or elective tax law changes, tax accounting changes, tax procedural changes, or tax policy changes during the 2017
through 2019 GRC period.  The account will remain open and the balance in the account will be reviewed in every subsequent GRC proceeding until a CPUC
decision closes the account.

67

The final decision approved a revenue requirement increase of $88 million for 2017, with additional increases of $444 million in 2018 and $361 million in 2019, in
line with the amounts proposed in the settlement agreement.  The following table shows the revenue requirement amounts approved in the final decision based on

As required by the final decision, the Utility has submitted a variety of compliance filings, including filings on June 12, 2017, which provides accounting for the
January 2017 $300 million expense reduction announcement and on July 10, 2017, providing an update of the cost effectiv eness study for the SmartMeter™
Upgrade project.  On February 8, 2018, the CPUC exte nded the statutory deadline for the 2017 GRC from February 8, 2018 to August 9, 2018, in order to allow
for comments and CPUC action on any PD on the SmartMeter TM Upgrade cost effectiveness study, as well as one other remaining GRC compliance item.

2020
General
Rate
Case

The Utility expects to file the 2020 GRC by September 1, 2018. On November 30, 2017, the Utility filed its first RAMP submittal to the CPUC in advance of its
2020 GRC filing.   The RAMP is a new CPUC requirement directing each large energy utility to submit a report describing how it assesses its risks and how it
plans to mitigate and minimize such risks in advance of the utility’s GRC applica tion.  The objective of this filing is to inform the CPUC of the Utility’s top
safety-related risks, risk assessment procedures, and proposed mitigations of those risks for 2020-2022.

The SED is expected to submit a report on the Utility’s RAMP submitta l and hold a workshop on the report, after which parties will have the opportunity to file
comments.  The RAMP results will be incorporated in the Utility’s 2020 GRC.

2015
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Case

During 2016, the CPUC issued final decisio n s in phase one and phase two of the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case .  T he phase one decision adopted the revenue
requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect through rates beginning August 1, 2016, to recover its costs of gas transmission and stor age services for the
2015 GT&S rate case period (2015 through 2018).  The phase two decision determined the allocation of the $850 million penalty assessed in the San Bruno
Penalty Decision and the revenue requirement reduction for the five-month delay cau sed by the Utility’s violation of the CPUC ex parte communication rules in
this proceeding.

68

The phase one decision excluded from rate base $696 million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted.  The decision
permanently d isallow ed $120 m illion of that amount and ordered that the remaining $57 6 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the
possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding .  A draft of the audit report is expected in the first quarter of 2018.  The decision established
new one-way balancing accounts to track costs as well as various cost caps that will increase the risk of disallowance over the current rate case cycle .  The Utility
would be required to take a charge i n the future if the CPUC’s audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending resulted in additional permanent disallowance.

In August 2016 and January 2017, TURN, ORA and Indicated Shippers filed applications for rehearing of the phase one and phase two decisi ons, respectively.
The Utility cannot predict when or if the CPUC will grant the rehearing s or if it will adop t the parties’ recommendations.  Additionally, in June 2017, the Utility
filed a PFM of the phase one decision to eliminate the requirement that the Utility install new cathodic protection systems in 2018 because the Utility is not in a
position to identify the optimal location for such new systems in 2018.  Instead, the Utility requested to be allowed to continue its current cathodic protection pr
ogram.  As directed by the CPUC, on August 23, 2017, the Utility provided supplemental information to the CPUC regarding the PFM.  The Utility is unable to
predict if and when the CPUC would adopt the PFM .  In the event the PFM is not adopted and the Utili ty fails to perform the mandated new cathodic protection
systems, the Utility could incur fines and penalties, the amount of which the Utility is unable to predict.

2019
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Case

On November 17, 2017, the Utility filed its 2019 GT&S rate case application with the CPUC, covering the years 2019 through 2021.  While the Utility has not
formally proposed a fourth year for this rate case, it provided a revenue requirement and rates for 2022, in the event the CPUC adopts an additio nal year.

In its application, the Utility requested that the CPUC authorize a 2019 revenue requirement of $1.59 billion to recover anticipated costs of providing natural gas
transmission and storage services beginning on January 1, 2019.   This corresponds to an increase of $289 million over the Utility’s 2018 authorized revenue
requirement of $1.30 billion.   The Utility’s request also includes proposed revenue requirements of $1.73 billion for 2020, $1.91 billion for 2021, and $1.91 billion
for 2022 if the CPUC orders a fourth year for the rate case period.

The requested rate base for 2019 is $4.66 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $0.95 billion over the 2018 authorized rate base of $3.71 billion.   These rate
base amounts exclude approximately $ 576 million of capital spending subject to audit by the CPUC related to 2011 through 2014 expenditures in excess of
amounts adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case.   The Utility is unable to predict whether the $576 million, or a portion thereof, will ultimatel y be authorized by the
CPUC and included in the Utility’s future rate base.   The Utility’s request also excludes rate base adjustments that the Utility requested with the CPUC on
November 14, 2017, resulting from the IRS’s October 5, 2017 private letter ru ling issued in connection with the CPUC’s final phase two decision in the 2015
GT&S rate case.  The Utility’s request is based on capital expenditure forecasts of $971 million for 2019, $963 million for 2020, and $804 million for 2021 (which
exclude common capital allocations).

The increase in revenue requirement is largely attributable to increased infrastructure investment and costs related to new natural gas storage safety and
environmental regulations.   Such new regulations were issued by: (1) the DOGG R, which issued six new safety and reliability natural gas storage measures in
2016 in response to the 2015 Southern California natural gas storage leak in Aliso Canyon; (2) the PHMSA, which issued interim final rules, effective January 18,
2017, that addr ess pipeline safety issues and mandate certain reporting requirements for operators of underground natural gas storage facilities; and (3) the CPUC,
which issued General Order 112-F that became effective on January 1, 2017, and requires additional expendit ures in the areas of gas leak repair, leak survey, and
high consequence area identification, among other things.

In addition, DOGGR is planning to complete its final rulemaking on new gas storage safety rules.   The draft rules, that were released for comments on May 19,
2017, include a requirement for natural gas storage operators to perform well integrity assessments every two years and to eliminate possibl e single points of
failure from natural gas storage wells.   The implementation timeframe and requirements under the PHMSA’s proposed regulations currently are being challenged
in federal courts.   In its application, the Utility proposes a new two-way Gas S torage Balancing Account to address uncertainty around the anticipated DOGGR
regulations, and also proposes a new memorandum account to track costs related to other anticipated new regulations.

As a result of the existing and anticipated gas storage safet y requirements, the Utility developed and proposed in its 2019 GT&S rate case application a natural gas
storage strategy which includes the discontinuation (through closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields.   The discontinuation is expected to reduce
long-term costs for customers and to reduce safety and environmental risks.

In addition to costs related to new natural gas storage safety and environmental regulations, the Utility proposed increased infrastructure investments over the 2019
to 2021 period to continue its efforts to improve overall system safety by: (1) making approximately 1,100 miles of transmission pipelines capable of in-line
inspection; (2) performing in-line inspections of over 2,100 miles of transmission pipeline, or appro ximately one-third of total miles; (3) testing or replacing all
pipeline without a test record (or with a test record that does not meet the Utility’s documentation requirements) by 2027; (4) replacing vintage pipeline for other
safety or reliability issue s; and (5) automating valves in areas where there is a significant potential impact.

A prehearing conference took place on January 4, 2018, and established a procedural schedule.  Testimony will be served near the end of second quarter of 2018
and evidenti ary hearings, if needed, will begin in the third quarter of 2018. As stated above, the Utility expects to file an update of its revenue requirement forecast
to reflect the Tax Act by the end of March 2018.

On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed its TO18 rate case at the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.7 2 billion, a $387
million increase over the 2016 revenue requirement o f $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 is $6.7 billion.  The Utility is also
seeking a return on equity of 10.9%, which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the C AISO.  In the
filing, the Utility forecasted that it will make investments of $1.30 billion in 2017 in various capital projects.

On September 30, 2016, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July 2016 filing and set it for hearing, but held the hearing procedures in abeyance for
settlement procedures.  The order set an effective date for rates of March 1, 2017, and made the rates subject to refund following resolution of the case.  On March
17, 2017, the FERC chief judge issued an order termi nating the settlement procedures due to an impasse in the settlement negotiations reported by the parties.

On August 22, 2017, the FERC trial staff submitted testimony.  The table below summarizes the differences between the amount of revenue requiremen t increases

Additionally, intervenors provided testimony on July 5, 2017 and the Utility submitted rebuttal testimony on October 9, 2017.  Hearings in this proceeding took
place January 9 through January 30, 2018, and an initial decision is expe cted on or before June 1, 2018.

Also, on March 31, 2017, several of the parties that had already intervened in the TO18 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC, and requested that the complaint
be consolid ated with the rate case.   The complaint asserts that the Utility’s revenue requirement request in TO18 is unreasonably high and should be reduced.
The complaint asks that, if the outcome of the litigation in TO18 is that the Utility’s revenue requirement should be set at a lower level than the revenue
requirement from the TO17 settlement, that the FERC order refunds to that lower level determined in TO18 litigation.  On April 20, 2017, the Utility answered the
complaint, requesting that FERC dismiss it. On November 16, 2017, FERC dismissed the c omplaint as the Utility had requested.  On December 18, 2017, the
complainants filed a r equest for rehearing of that order, and on January 16, 2018, FERC issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration.  That order
does not address the merits of the complaint; it simply gives FERC more time to reconsider its prior order dismissing the complaint.  The Utility is unable to
predict when FERC may issue an order on the merits of the complaint.

On July 2 7 , 2017, the Utility filed its TO19 rate case at the FERC requesting a 2018 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.79 billion, a $74
million increase over the proposed 2 017 revenue req uirement of $1.72 billion. The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2018 is $6.9 billion.  The Utility
is also seeking a n ROE of 10.75%, which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAIS O.  In the
filing, the Utility forecasted capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion.  On September 28, 2017 , the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July
2017 filing, subject to hearing and refund, and established March 1, 2018 , as the eff ective date for rate changes.  The next settlement conference is scheduled for
May 16, 2018.  FERC also ordered that the hearings will be held in abeyance pending settlement discussion among the parties.

On September 29, 2017 , several of the parties that have intervened in the TO1 9 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC, and requested that the complaint be
consolidated with the TO19 rate case.  The complaint asserts that the Utility’s revenue requirement request in TO19 is unreasonably high and should be reduced.
The complaint asks that, if the outcome of the litigation in TO1 9 is that the Utility’s revenue requirement should be set at a lower level than the settled revenue
requirement approved by FERC in TO17, FERC order refunds to that lower level deter mined in the TO1 8 litigation. On October 17, 2017, the Utility answered
the complaint, requesting that FERC dismiss it.  The Utility is unable to predict when and how the FERC will respond to the complaint.

On August 11, 2016, the Utility submitted an application to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025
and replace it with a portfolio of energy efficiency and GHG-free resources.  The applicati on implements a joint proposal between the Utility and the Friends of
the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, Coalition of California Utility
Employees, and Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility (together, the “Joint Parties”) .

On January 11, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Utility’s proposal to retire Diablo Canyon Unit 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025.  The CPUC also:

deferred consideration of replacement resources to the CPUC’s Integrated Resource Planning proceeding;

authorized rate recovery for up to $ 211.3 million (compared with the $352.1 million requested by the Utility) for an em ployee retention program;

authorized rate recovery for an employee re training program of $11.3 million requested by the Utility;

rejected rate recovery of the proposed $85 million for the community impacts mitigation program on the ground that rate recovery for such a program
requires legislative authorization;

authorized rate recovery of $18.6 million of the total Diablo Canyon license renewal cost of $53 million and rate recovery of cancelled project costs
equal to 100% of direct costs incurred prior to June 30, 2016 , and 25% of direct costs incurred after June 30, 2016, based on a settlement agreement
among the Utility, the Joint Parties, and certain other parties that the Utility filed with the CPUC in May 2017; and

approved the amortization of the book value for Diablo Canyon consistent with the Diablo Canyon closure s chedule.

71

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Utility incurred pre-tax charges of $ 47 million related to the retireme nt of Diablo Canyon including $24 million
for cancelled projects and $ 23 million for disallowed license renewal costs.   The Utilit y does not expect to incur additional charges as a result of the CPUC’s
final decision , other than additional project cancellation costs that the Utility does not expect to be material .

The Joint Parties determined that they will not seek a rehearing on the CPUC final decision.  In accepting the CPUC's decision to retire Diablo Canyon, the Utility
will withdraw its license renewal application at the NRC .

On June 28, 2016, the California State Lands Commission approved a new lands lease for the intake and discharge s tructures at Diablo Canyon to run concurrently
with Diablo Canyon’s current operating licenses, until Diablo Canyon Unit 2 ceases operations in August 2025.  The Utility believes that the approval of the new
lease will ensure sufficient time for the Utilit y to identify and bring online a portfolio of GHG-free replacement resources.  The Utility will submit a future lease
extension request to address the period of time required for plant decommissioning, which under NRC regulations can take as long as 60 yea rs.  On August 28,
2016, the World Business Academy filed a writ in the Los Angeles Superior Court asserting that the State Lands Commission committed legal error when it
determined that the short term lease extension for an existing facility was exempt fr om review under the California Environmental Quality Act and alleging that
the State Lands Commission should be required to perform an environmental review of the new lands lease.  The trial took place on July 11, 2017, in Los Angeles
Superior Court and th e judge dismissed the petition on all grounds, ruling that the State Lands Commission properly determined the short term lease extension was
subject to the existing facilities exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act. The World Business Aca demy appealed this decision and the matter is
currently before the California Court of Appeals in Los Angeles, Second District.  The trial date has not been set.

Asset
Retirement
Obligations

The Utility expects that the decommissioning of Diablo Canyo n will take many years after the expiration of its current operating licenses.  Detailed studies of the
cost to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP.  Actual decommissioning costs
may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor,
materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning c osts from customers through a non-bypassable charge that the
Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.

While the NDCTP forecast includes employee severance program estimates, it does not include estimated costs related to the fi nal decision’s employee retention
and retraining and development programs, and the San Luis Obispo County community mitigation program described above.  The Utility intends to conduct a site-
specific decommissioning study to update the 2015 NDCTP forecast and to submit the study to the CPUC by mid-2019.

The Utility expects to file its 2018 NDCTP application in late 2018 or early 2019.  (See “Asset Retirement Obligations” in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.)

CPUC
Cost
of
Capital

On July 13, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting, with no modifications to it , the PFM filed in February 2017 by San Diego Gas & Electric Company,
Southern California Gas Company, Southern California Edison, the ORA, TURN, and the Utility.

The final decision extends the Utility’s next cost of capital application filing deadline by two years to April 22, 2019, for the year 2020.  The final decision also
reduces the Utility’s authorized ROE from 10.40% to 10.25%, effective January 1, 2018, and resets the Utility’s authorized cost of long-term debt and preferred
stock effective January 1, 2018.  In addition, the decision suspends the cost of capital adjustment mechanism to adjust cost of capital for 2018, but allows the
adjustment mechanism to o perate for 2019 if triggered.  If the mechanism is activated for 2019, the Utility’s cost of capital, including its new ROE of 10.25%, will
be adjusted according to the ex isting terms of the mechanism.  The Utility’s current capital structure of 52% common equity, 47% long-term debt, and 1%
preferred equity remains unchanged.

The final decision also leaves the proceeding open to facilitate gathering of information to inform the next cost of capital proceeding, as well as to provide a
possible venue in whi ch to consider whether the Utility’s ROE should be reduced until any recommendations that the CPUC may adopt in the second phase of its
safety culture investigation are implemented, as described in the May 8, 2017 scoping m emo a nd r uling issued in the Safe ty Culture OII.

72

On September 29, 2017, the Utility submitted an advice letter to the CPUC, updating its cost of capital and the estimated revenue requirement impacts with an
effective date of January 1, 2018.  The long-term debt cost , reset to 4.89%, ref lects actual embedded costs as of the end of August 2017 and forecasted interest
rates for the new long-term debt expected to be issued for the remainder of 2017 and all of 2018.  Changes in market interest rates may have material effects on the
cost of th e Utility’s future financings, but will not affect the authorized cost of capital in 2018.

The Utility expects to file its next cost of capital application in 2019.

Application
to
Establish
a
Wildfire
Expense
Memorandum
Account

On July 26, 2017, the U tility filed an application with the CPUC requesting to establish a WEMA to track wildfire expenses and to preserve the opportunity for the
Utility to request recovery of wildfire costs in excess of insurance at a future date.  Concurrently with this appli cation, the Utility also submitted a motion to the
CPUC requesting that the WEMA be deemed effective as of July 26, 2017, such that the Utility may begin recording costs to the account while the application is
pending before the CPUC.

Under the WEMA as proposed, the Utility would record costs related to wildfire s , including: (1) payments to satisfy wildfire claims, including any deductibles,
co-insurance and other insurance expense paid by the Utility but excluding costs that have already been authorized in the Utility’s GRC; (2) outside legal costs
incurred in the defense of wildfire claims; (3) premium costs not in rates; and (4) the cost of financing these amounts. Insurance proceeds, as well as any payments
received from third parties, would be credi ted to the WEMA as they are received.  The WEMA would not include the Utility’s costs for fire response and
infrastructure costs which are tracked in CEMA.  The Utility would be required to file an application to seek approval to recover costs tracked in W EMA.  A
prehearing conference was held on December 8, 2017, and a scoping memo was issued on January 11, 2018.  The Utility filed opening briefs with the CPUC on
January 25, 2018 and other parties’ briefs are expected to be filed in February 2018.  The Uti lity cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

Catastrophic
Event
Memorandum
Account
Applications

The CPUC allows utilities to recover the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events through a CEMA.  The CEMA tariff authorize s the
utilities to recover costs incurred in connection with a catastrophic event that has been declared a disaster or state of emergency by competent federal or state
authorities. In 2014 , the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire preventi on and vegetation management work in response to the se vere drought in
California.  The costs associated with this work were tracked in the CEMA .  While the Utility believes such costs are recoverable through CEMA, its CEMA
applications are subject to CPUC a pproval.

In 2016, the Utility submitted a request to the CPUC to authorize recovery under the CEMA tariff revenue requirement of approximately $146 million for recorded
capital and expense costs related to drought mitigation and emergency response activities for declared disasters that occurred from D ecember 2012 through March
2016 .  On January 4 , 2018, ORA, TURN, and the Utility filed an all-party motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement these parties have
entered into .  The settlement agreement proposes that the Utility’s total CEMA tariff revenue requirement request be reduced by $29 million, from $146 million to
$117 million.   The Utility has requested that these costs be recovered through rates in 2018 and 2019 .  PG&E Corp oration and the Ut ility are unable to predict
the outcome of this proceeding.

The Utility expects to submit its 2018 CEMA application to the CPUC in the second quarter of 2018 .

As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, the Utility filed its proposed DRP for approval by the CPUC.  The Utility’s plan identifies optimal locations on its
electric distribution system for deployment of DERs.  The Utility’s proposa l is designed to allow energy technologies to be integrated into the larger grid while
continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable, and affordable electric service.

73

On February 27, 2017, the CPUC issued a ruling that seeks the development of a p rocess for incorporating DER forecasts into the DRP that takes into
consideration the coordination with other statewide planning and forecasting processes such as the CEC’s Integrated Energy Policy Report.  This ruling mandated
the Utility, along with the other California IOUs, to develop a draft joint proposal for the CPUC and stakeholder consideration on the process for developing DER
forecasts.  On June 9, 2017, the IOUs submitted a draft joint proposal for CPUC and stakeholder consideration. The CPUC is sued a PD on December 8, 2017,
requiring the IOUs to use the CEC’s DER forecast for the 2018-2019 distribution planning cycle.  The Utility has historically used the CEC forecast for planning
and will have the opportunity to adjust forecasts for EV, photov oltaic , and energy storage during the intermediate years.  The PD also requires the IOUs to
develop an alternate planning forecast scenario in 2018 to establish a method for calculating costs and benefits for DER grid integration to better inform DER
sourci ng policies.  Workshops to discuss the joint proposal will continue in early 2018 and a final decision is expected from the CPUC by the end of the first
quarter of 2018.

On June 30, 2017, the CPUC issued another ruling soliciting stakeholder responses on questions set forth in a CPUC staff white paper on proposing a DIDF.  The
DIDF aims to establish a process for identifying distribution deferral opportunities for DERs.  Stakeholder comments on DIDF were submitted on August 7, 2017,
with reply comments sub mitted on August 18, 2017. On December 8, 2017, the CPUC issued a PD requiring an annual grid needs assessment and an annual
distribution deferral opportunity report, as part of the annual DRP for greater transparency on infrastructure investments. The g rid needs assessment report will
identify critical overload areas on the grid.  The distribution deferral opportunity report will document the Utility’s proposed distribution needs and identify DER
deferral opportunities to be reviewed by the Distribution Planning Advisory Group for prioritizing DER deferral projects.   The PD proposes to adopt the
regulatory incentive mechanism being piloted in the Integrated Distributed Energy Resources Proceeding where the Utility can earn a 4% pre-tax incentive on the
an nual payments for DER deferral contracts.  The Utility expects a final decision from the CPUC in the first quarter of 2018.

Program

On April 4, 2016, the CPUC issued a ruling proposing to establish, on a pilot basis, an interim program offering regulatory incentives to the Utility and the other
two large California IOUs for the deployment of cost-effective DERs.  The ruling stated that it did not intend for this phase to adopt a new regulatory framework or
business model for the California electric utilities.  On December 22, 2016, the CPUC issued a final decision in the proceeding which authorizes a pilot to test a
regulatory incentive mechanism through which the Utility will earn a 4% pre-tax incentive on annual payments for DERs, as well as test a regulatory process that
will allow the Utility to competitively solicit DER services to defer distribution infrastructure.  Each IOU is required to conduct at least one pilot, but may conduct
up to three additional pilots.

In June 2017, the Utility submitted a pilot project proposal to the CPUC for approval to begin solicitations.  The pilot aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an
earnings opportunity in motiv ating utilities to source DERs.  On October 27, 2017, the CPUC issued a draft resolution that proposed modifications to the Utility’s
pilot program. On December 14, 2017, the CPUC granted the Utility’s November 20, 2017 request to cancel the current pilot project proposa l due to the damage
of the Utility’s facilities in the area of the Northern California wildfires and propose a new pilot program location by May 1, 2018.

On December 1 4 , 2017, the CPUC approved a fina l 2015 – 2016 energy savings performance incentive award of $21.9 million, compared to the Utility’s request
of $24.7 million. The award was fully offset by a portion of the remaining reduction approved in the settlement agreement related to the rehearing o f the 2006 –
2008 risk/reward incentive mechanism.  The settlement agreement requires the Utility to reduce future energy efficiency shareholder incentives by a total of $29.1
million, of which $5.8 million was used to offset the 2014 – 2015 award.  The re maining settlement reduction of $1.3 million will be offset against future energy
saving performance incentive awards.

LEGISLATIVE
AND
REGULATORY
INITIATIVES

The California Legislature and the CPUC have adopted requirements, policies , and decisions to implement new state law requirements applicable to natural gas
storage facilities , accommodate the growth in distributed electric generation resources (including solar installations), increase the amount of renewable energy
delivered to customers, improve fire safety regulations, and foster the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure to encourage the use of
electric vehicles.   In addition, the CPUC continues to implement state law requirements to reform electric rates to more cl osely reflect the utilities’ actual costs of
service, and reduce cross-subsidizat ion among customer rate classes .   CPUC proceedings related to some of these matters are discussed below.

74

The Utility’s ability to recover its costs, including investments as sociated with legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as its electricity procurement and other
operating costs, will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanism s can be
timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas service.

Power
Charge
Indifference
Adjustment
OIR

On April 25, 2017, the Utility, along with Southern California Edison Company and San Diego Gas & Electric Company, filed a joint application with the CPUC
on how to allocate costs associated with long-term power commitments in a manner that ensures all customers are treated equally.  At issue is how customers
within communities that choose to i mplement CCA power arrangements and those served under direct access pay for their share of the costs.  The utilities believe
that these customers are not paying their full share of costs associated with the long-term commitments, which results in other cu stomers paying more, which is
inconsistent with state law.  The Utility is committed to helping create a cost allocation method that treats all customers fairly and equally, whether they continue
to receive service from the Utility or choose a CCA or direc t access provider.  The Utili ty projects that more than half of its customers will purchase electricity
from a CCA or direct access provider by 2020.  Without changes to the current cost allocation system, a portion of the contract and facilities costs wil l be shifted
to customers who remain with the Utility or live in areas that do not have access to alternative electricity providers.  The utilities’ joint proposed approach would
replace the current system, which is known as the PCIA, with an updated syste m known as the Portfolio Allocation Methodology.

On June 29, 2017, the CPUC dismissed the Utility’s joint Portfolio Allocation Methodology application without prejudice and instead approved an OIR to review,
revise, and consider alternatives to the PCIA.   The OIR will focus on PCIA within the larger context of consumer choice in energy services, and should not be
considered a follow-up to the CPUC and Energy Commission Joint En Banc on Customer Choice in California.  On September 25, 2017, the CPUC issued a
scoping memo and ruling establishing a procedural schedule and a new overall goal to mitigate cost increases for both bundled and departing load customers.
Testimony is scheduled for the first quarter of 2018.  Evidentiary hearings , if needed, are sche duled for the second quarter of 2018 and a proposed decision is
expected by the third quarter of 2018.

Customer
Choice

On May 19, 2017, California energy companies, along with other stakeholders discussed customer choice and the future of California’s el ectric industry at a
CPUC “en banc” meeting.  Specifically, the goal of the meeting was to frame a discussion on the trends that are driving change within California’s electricity
sector and overall clean-energy economy and to lay out elements of a path fo rward to ensure that California achieves its reliability, affordability, equity, and
carbon reduction imperatives while recognizing the important role that technology and customer preferences will play in shaping this future.

On October 11, 2017, the CP UC announced the formation of the California Customer Choice Project to examine the issues and produce a report evaluating
regulatory framework options in early 2018.  The CPUC held an informal public workshop on October 31 ,
2017 , to gather stakeholder inp ut on global and
national electric market choice models, including California’s 2020 market.  The project may produce a white paper that will provide a framework to evaluate
customer choice models based on affordability, decarbonization, and reliability.  The white paper will not present a recommendation nor is it intended to provide
the basis for instituting a rulemaking .  While the CPUC had indicated its intent to open a proceeding related to customer choice, the Utility is unable to predict
whether that remains the CPUC’s intent or the timing of any such proceeding.

In December 2014, the CPUC issued a decision adopting a policy to expand the California utilities’ role in developing EV charging infrastructure to support
California’s climate goals.  On February 9, 2015, the Utility filed an application requesting that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposal to deploy, own, and
maintain EV charging stations and the associated infrastructure.  On De cember 15, 2016, the CPUC issued a fina l decision establishing a three-year EV program
of $130 million (approximately $109 million in capital expenditures) to deploy up to 7,500 charging stations.  Further deployment of light-duty EV infrastructure
will be considered in a second phase of the proceeding.

Tra

Electrification
(TE)

California Law (S B 350) requires the CPUC, in consultation with the CARB and the CEC, to direct electrical corporations to file applications for programs and
investment s to accelerate widespread TE.  In September 2016, the CPUC directed the Utility and the other large IOUs to file TE applications which include both
short-term projects (of up to $20 million in total) and two- to five-year programs with a requested revenue requirement determined by the Utility.  On January 20,
2017, the Utility filed its TE application with the CPUC requesting a total of up to $253 million (approximately $211 million in capital expenditures) in program
funding over five years (2018 - 2022) related to make-ready infrastructure for TE in medium to heavy-duty vehicle sectors, fast charging stations, and short-term
projects which includes a series of TE demonstratio n projects and pilot programs.  On January 11 , 201 8 , the CPUC approved , with modi fications, four out of
the five short-term projects proposed by the Utility for a total of approximately $8 million.  The CPUC may issue a proposed decision o n the make-ready
infrastructure proposals in the first or second quarter of 2018.

Fire
Safety
OIR

On December 14, 2017, the CPUC approved new regulations to enhance the fire safety of overhead electric transmission and distribution lines located in high fire-
threat areas.  This is the culmination of a decade-long effort to improve the fire safety of overhead utility and communication infrastructure across California.  The
SED conferred with Cal Fire, California IOUs, and fire safety professionals, to develop and adopt a statewide fire-threat map.  This map, in conjunction with a
United States Forest Ser vice and Cal Fire map of tree mortality high hazard zones, will dictate the application of the new fire safety regulations. On January 19,
2018, the CPUC approved the final fire safety map associated with the new regulations.

The new regulations include increased patrol frequency for overhead facilities , expanded vegetation clearances around powerlines , and give the utilities increased
authority to de-energize lines on private property for the removal of trees that pose an immediate threat to fire safety .  The costs associated with the
implementation of these new regulations will be tracked in a fire hazard prevention memorandum account and requested for recovery through rates.

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of
the Utility’s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous
wastes; the reporting and reduction of CO 2 and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety and reliability
measures for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors ,
“Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 . and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8 .)

RISK
MANAGEMENT
ACTIVITIES

PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownership of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest
rates, and counterparty credit.

The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, re duce
commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non- trading purposes ( i.e . risk mitigation) and not for
speculative purposes .  The Utility’s risk management activities include the use of physical and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps,
options, and other instruments and agreements, most of which are accounted for as derivative instruments.  Some contracts are accounted for as leases.

76

Commodity
Price
Risk

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and
nuclear fuel necessary for electricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers.  As long a s the Utility can conclude that it is probable that its
reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices will not affect
earnings . Such fluctuations, howe ver, may impact cash flows.   The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers are also fully
recoverable through a ratemaking mechanism.

The Utility’s current authorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected.
The Utility recovers these costs in its gas transmission and storage rate cases through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts,
resulting in pric e and volumetric risk.  The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks.  The Utility’s value-at-risk was
approximately $ 8 million and $7 million at December 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .  During 2017 , t he Utility’s approximate high, low, and average values-
at-risk were $8 million, $7 million and $7 million, respectively. During 2016 , the value-at-risk amounts were $7 million, $1 million and $4 million, respectively .
( See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of price risk management activities.)

Interest
Rate
Risk

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market
interest rates.  A t December 31 , 2017 and 2016 , if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term
debt, and cash investments , th e impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $ 12 million and $13 million, respectively, based on net variable rate debt
and other interest rate-sensitive instruments outstanding.   ( See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of
interest rates .)

Energy
Procurement
Credit
Ris
k

The Utility conducts business with counterparties mainly in the energy industry, including the CAISO market, other California investor-owned electric utilities,
municipal utilities, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generatio n companies, and oil and natural gas production companies located in the
United States and Canada.  If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas, then the Utility may find it necessary to
procure electricit y or gas at current market prices, which may be higher than the contract prices.

The Utility manages credit risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit
ratings, a nd other credit criteria as deemed appropriate.  Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.  The Utility executes many energy contracts
under master commodity enabling agreements that may require security (referred to as “Credit Collatera l” in the table below).  Credit c ollateral may be in the
form of cash or letters of credit.  The Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or
other eligible securities (as deeme d appropriate by the Utility).  Credit c ollateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current net
receivables and replacement cost exposure exceed contractually specified limits.

The following table summarizes the Utility’ s energy procurement credit risk exposure to its counterparties :

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

The preparation of the Conso lidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses durin g the reporting period.  The
accounting policies described below are considered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and
material to the financial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgments
and estimates.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions .  These accounting policies and their key characteristics are ou tlined
below.

Regulatory
Accounting

As a regulated entity, t he Utility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers.  These
amounts would otherwise be recorded to expense or income under GAAP.  Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  At December 31, 2017 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulato ry assets (including current
regulatory balancing accounts receivable) of $ 5 .6 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $9.9 billion .

Determining probability requires signifi cant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory
hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court ap peals.  For some of the
Utility’s regulatory assets, including utility retained generation , the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the
CPUC .  The Utility also records a regulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery
of incurred costs is probable, such as the r egulatory assets for pension benefits ; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, on
reacquired debt.  The CPUC has not denied the recovery of any material costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented.  If
the Utility determined that it is no longer probable th at regulatory assets would be reco vered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to
rate regulation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made.   I f regulatory accounting did not
apply, the Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or
revenue recognition.

In addition, regulatory accounting standards require recognition of a   loss if it beco mes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking
purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regarding
probability of recovery, as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expected
to exceed the amount to be recovered.   The Utility records a provision based on its best estimate; to the extent t here is a high degree of uncertainty in the Utility’s
forecast, it will record a provision based on the lower end of the range of possible losses.   The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments
regarding detailed project plans, esti mates included in third-party contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental
compliance standards, and a variety of other factors.

In 2017, t he Utility recorded charges of $47 million for capital expenditures related to cancelled projects and disallowed license renewal costs as part of the Diablo
Canyon settlement agreement.  In 2016, the Utility incurred charges of $283 million and $219 million for capital spending that wa s disallowed related to the San
Bruno Penalty Decision and for capital expenditures disallowed based on the final phase two decision in its 2015 GT&S rate case, respectively.  In 2015, the
Utility incurred charges of $407 million for capital spending that were disallowed related to the San Bruno Penalty Decision.  The Utility would be required to
record charges in future periods to the extent there are additional capital disallowances.  (See “ Enforcement and Litigation Matters ” in Note 1 3 of the Notes to th
e Consolidated F inancial Statements in Item 8.)

78

Loss
Contingencies

As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and t he Utility have recorded material accruals for various enforcement and legal matters and enviro nmental remediation
liabilities.  PG& E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.

Enforcement
and
Litigation
Matters

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are name d as parties in a number of claims
and lawsuits.  In addition, penalties may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility
record a provision for a loss contingency when it is both p robable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E
Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount w ithin
the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is
estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the
impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events
pertaining to a pa rticular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as
incurred.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  (See “Enforcement and Litig ation Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Environmental
Remediation
Liabilities

The Utility is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in t he future may require the Utility to pay
for environmental remediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party.  Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous
substances at various potential sites, including f ormer manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for the
storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.

The Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potential
site requiring remedial action.  (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determi ne its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in
cooperation with regulatory agencies.  For example, the Utility has begun a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.)  Based on such
notification, the Utility completes an assessment of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred.  The Utility
records an environmental remediation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonab ly estimate the loss or a range of possible
losses .  Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the
process for estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment.  Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent
and types of hazardous substances at a potential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in
proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

When possible, the Utility estimates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience f or costs incurred at similar sites depending on
the level of information available.  Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who are
expected to devote a significant amount of t ime directly to the remediation effort.  These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions,
operations and maintenance activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.
Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years.  During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may
change, as well as site conditions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of t he remediation effort.

79

At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Utility ’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $ 1 b illion and $ 958 million, respectively.  The
Utility’s undiscounted future costs c ould increase to as much as $ 2.1 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or
if the other potentially responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond
regulatory requirements.  Although the Utility has provided for known environmenta l obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may
vary significantly from actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.

Insurance
Receivable

The Utility has liability   insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third party claims.  The Utility records insurance recoveries only when a
third party claim is recorded and it is deemed probable that a recovery of that claim will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.
The assessment of whether recovery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series of
complex ju dgments about future events.     Insurance recoveries are reviewed quarterly   and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact   of all known information,
including contractual liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with si milar events, discussions with insurers and other
information and events pertaining to a particular matter.   (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 13   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.)

Asset
Retirement
Obligation
s

PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value
and its settlement date can be made.  At the time of recording an ARO, the associated as set retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset.  The Utility recognize s a regulatory asset or liabilit y for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered
through the rate making process.   (See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

To estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant est imates and assumptions abou t future decommissioning costs,
inflation rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning.  The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the
risk associated with the decommissioning obligation.

At December 31, 2017 , the Utility’s recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was $ 4.9 billion .   Changes in these estimates and
assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.

Pension
and
Other
Postretirement
Benefit
Plans

PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible emplo yees a s well as contributory postretirement health
care and medical plans for eligible r etirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and
retirees .   Adjustments to the pension and oth er benefit obligation are based on the d ifferences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results .  These
amounts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis.   The differences between pe nsion benefit
expense recognized in accordance with GAAP and amounts recognized for ratem aking purposes are recorded as regulatory asset s or liabilit ies as amounts are
probable of recovery from customers.   To the extent the other benefits are in an overfun ded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability.   (See Note 3 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date.  The significant a ctuarial
assumptions used in determining pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health care
cost tre nd rate and the expected return on plan assets.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as
necessary .  While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significa nt differences in actual experience, plan changes
or amendments, or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit oblig ations and future plan
expenses.

I n establishing health care cost ass umptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider rec ent cost trends and projections from industry experts .  This
evaluation suggests that current rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near term.  In recognition of continued high inflation i n health care costs and
given the design of PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2018 is 6.8 % , gradually decreasing to the u ltimate trend rate of 4.5 %
in 2027 and beyond .

80

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations of
the employee benefit trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Fixed - income returns were projected based on real maturity and credit
sp reads added to a long-term inflat ion rate.  Equity returns were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term rate
of inflation.  For the Utility’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.2 % compares to a ten-year actual return of 7.8 % .

The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 623 Aa-grade non-callable
bonds at December 31, 2017 .  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated futu re cash flows for the
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

NOTE
1:
ORGANIZATION
AND
BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION

NOTES
TO
THE
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and central
California.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of el ectricity and natural gas to customers.  The Utility is primarily regulated by
the CPUC and the FERC.  In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.

This is a co mbined annual report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s C onsolidated F inancial S tatements include the accounts of PG&E
Corporation, the Utility, and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  The Utility’s Consolidated F inancial S tatements include the accounts of the Utility
and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   The Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements apply to both PG&E Corporati on and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources on a
consolidated basis (i.e., the companies operate in one segment).

The accompanying C onsolidated F inancial S tatements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form
10-K.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP require s the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, rev enues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilitie s.  Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to the
Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, environmental remediation lia bilities, ARO s, and pension and other postretirement
benefit plans obligations.  Management believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected in the C onsolidated F inancial S tatements are appropriate and
reasonable.  A change in management’s estimates o r assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition and results of operations and cash flows during the period in which such change occurred.

Beginning on October 8, 20 17, multiple wildfires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humbold t, Mendocino, Del Norte , Lake,
Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Y uba City (the “Northern California wildfires ”).  According to the Cal Fire California Statewide
Fire Summary dated October 30, 2017, at the peak of the wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total,   burned over 245,000 acres, resulted
in 43 fatalities, and destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures.   Subsequently, the number of fatalities increased to 44.  The fires are being investigated by Cal Fire
and the CPUC, including the possible role of the Utility’s power lines and other facilities.   See “Northern California Wildfires” in Note 13 below.

NOTE
2:
SUMMARY
OF
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Regulation
and
Regulated
Operations

The Utility follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorized
by the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of providing service.  The Utility also records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking
process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility capitali zes and records as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise be
charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized over the future periods in which the
costs are recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Utility records those expected future costs as
regulatory liabilities.  A mounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers in the future are a lso recorded as regulatory liabilities.

Management continues to believe the use of regulatory accounting is applicable a nd that all regulatory assets and liabilitie s are recoverable or refundable.  To the
extent that portions of the Utility’s operations c ease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes in
regulation or other reasons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.

100

Revenue
Recognition

The Utility recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered .   The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy
delivered to customers but not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts rece ivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Rates charged to customers are based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements.

The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility’s revenues in the Utility’s GRC and its GT&S rate cases, which generally occur every three or four years.   T he Utility’s
ability to recover r evenue requirements authorized by the CPUC in these rates cases is independent, or “decoupled” from the volume of the Utility’s sales of
electricity and natural gas services.   The U tility recognizes revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of
recovery, and are expected to be collected within 24 months.   Generally, revenue is recognized ratably over the year.   The Utility records a balan cing account
asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery or refund.

The CPUC also has authorized the Utility to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs t hat the Utility has been authorized to pass on to customers,
including costs to purchase electricity and natural gas; and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.   In general , the
revenue recognition criteria for pa ss-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred.   The Utility records a regulatory balancing
account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover thos e costs , t o the extent that these
differences are probable of recovery or refund .  These differences have no impact on net income.

The FERC authorizes the Utility’s revenue requirements in periodic (often annual) TO rate cases.   The Utility’s ability t o recover revenue requirements
authorized by the FERC is dependent on the volume of the Utility’s electricity sales, and revenue is recognized only for amounts billed and unbilled , net of
revenues subject to refund .

C
ash
and
Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cas h equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at
fair value.

Allowance
for
Doubtful
Accounts
Receivable

PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts to record uncollectable customer accounts receivable at estimated net realizable
value.  The allowance is determined based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables , curren t economic conditions,
and assessment of customer collectability.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at weighted- average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies .   Natural gas stored underground is
recorded to inventory when injected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribut ion to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.
Materials and supplies are recorded to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropr iate, when consumed or installed.

Emission
Allowances

The Utility purchases GHG emission allowances to satisfy its compliance obligations.  Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets –
other and other noncurrent assets – ot her on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.

101

Property,
Plant,
and
Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciat ion or fair value .  Historical costs include labor and
materials, construction overhead, and AFUDC.  (See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful lives and balances of its property, plant, and
equipment were as follows:

(1) Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories.  Stored nuclear fuel inventory is stated at weighted- average cost.  Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as used based on the amount of energy

output.  (See Note 13 below.)

The Utility depreciates property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the
gross investment balance in a particular class of property.  This method approximates the straight line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property,
plant, and equipment.  The Utility’s co mposite depreciatio n rates were 3.83 % in 2017 , 3.73% in 2016 , and 3.80 % in 2015 .   The useful lives of the Utility’s
property, plant, and equipment are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers.
Depreciation expense includes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of fut ure removal, net of any salvage value at
retirement.  Upon retirement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs and
maintenance, including planned major maintenance act ivities and minor replacements of property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.

AFUDC

AFUDC represents the estimated cost s of debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and is
capitalized as part of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placed
in service.  AFUDC related to the cost of debt is recor ded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.
The Utility recorded AFUDC related to debt and equity, respectively, of $ 38 million and $ 89 mil lion during 2017, $ 51 million and $ 112 million during 2016 ,
and $ 48 million and $107 million during 2015.

The Utility has not recorded a liability related to certain ARO’s for assets that are expe cted to operate in perpetuity.  As t he Utility cannot estimate a settlement
date or range of potential settlement dates for these assets , reasonable estimate s of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for
retirement activitie s associated with substations, photovoltaic facilities, and certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and
certain communications equipment from leased property; and restoration o f land to specified conditions under ce rtain agreements.

102

Nuclear
Decommissioning
Obligation

Detailed studies of the cost to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCT P.  On May
25, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision in the 2015 NDCTP adopting a nuclear decommissioning cost estimate of $1.1 billion for Humboldt Bay,
corresponding to the Utility’s request, and $2.4 billion for Diablo Canyon, representing 64% of the U tility’s request of $3.8 billion.  On an aggregate basis, the
final decision adopted a $3.5 billion total nuclear decommissioning cost estimate, compared to $4.8 billion requested by the Utility.  Compared to the Utility’s
estimated cost to decommission Di ablo Canyon, the final decision adopts assumptions which lower costs for large component removal, site security,
decommissioning contractor staff, spent nuclear fuel storage, and waste disposal.  The Utility can seek recovery of these costs in the 2018 NDC TP.  The CPUC’s
final decision resulted in a $66 mill ion reduction to the ARO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the assumed length of the wet cooling period of spent
nuclear fuel after plant shut down.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an increase of $92 million to the ARO recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, to align the decommissioning
cost estimate with the CPUC’s final decision on the Utility’s application to retire Diablo Canyon Unit 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025.

The es timated nuclear decommissioning cost is discounted for GAAP purposes and recognized as an ARO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   The total nuclear
decommissioning obligation accrued was $ 3.5 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016 .   The estimated undiscounted nuclear decommissioning cost for the
Utility’s nuclear power plants was $ 4.1 billion at December 31, 2017 (or $ 7 billion in future dollars).  These estimates are based on the 2017 decommissioning
cost studies, prepared in accordance with CPUC requirements.

Disallowance
of
Plant
Costs

PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not be
recoverable through rates charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note
13 below.)

Nuclear
Decommissio
ning
Trusts

The Utility’s nuclear generation facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the
safe removal of a nuclear generation facilit y from service and the reduction of r esidual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and
release of the property for unrestricted use.  The Utility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts until
authorized f or release by the CPUC .

The Utility classifies its investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trust s as “available-for-sale.”  Since the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust assets
are managed by external inve stment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses are
considered other-than-temporary impairments.  Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refun dable or recoverable, respectively, from
customers through rates.   Therefore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact on
the Utility’s earnings or accumulated other compr ehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined by specific identification.

Variable
Interest
Entities

A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional s ubordinated financial support from other parties, or whose
equity investors lack any characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiary
and is required to consolid ate the VIE.

103

Some of the counterparties to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that would
generate electricity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIE s at December 31, 2017, it assessed
whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchase agreement
, analyzed the variability in the VIE’s gross margin , and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are most
significant to the VIE’s performance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  T he Utilit y’s financial obligation is limited to the amount
the Utility pays for delivered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are most
significant to the economic performance of a ny of these VIEs .  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2017 , it
did not consolidate any of them .

Other
Accounting
Policies

For other accounting policies impacting PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s consolidated financial statements, see “Income Taxes” in Note 8, “Derivatives ” in
Note 9, “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 10 , and “Contingencies an d Commitments” in Note 13 herein.

Presentation

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation
–
Retirement
Benefits
(Topic

, which amends the existing guidance relating to the presentation
of net periodic pension cost and net periodic other pos t-retirement benefit costs .   On a retrospective basis, the amendment requires an employer to separate the
service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost and provides explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component and other
components in the income statement.   In add ition, on a prospective basis, the ASU limits the component of net benefit cost eligible to be capitalized to service
costs.   The ASU became effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2018 .   The FERC has allowed and the Utility has made a one-time
election to adopt the new FASB guidance for regulatory filing purposes.   In January 2018 , the CPUC approved modifications to the Utility’s calculation for
pension-related revenue requirements to allow for capitalization of only the service cost c omponent determined by a plan’s actuaries.     The change in
capitalization of retirement benefits will not have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements .

Recognition
of
Lease
Assets
and

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases
(Topic
842)
, which amends the existing guidance relating to the definition of a lease, recognition of
lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, and the disclosure of key information a bout leasing arrangements.   In November, 2017, the FASB tentatively
decided to amend the new leasing guidance such that entities may elect not to restate their comparative periods in the period of adoption.  Under the new standard,
all lessees must recogni ze an asset and liability on the balance sheet.  Operating leases were previously not recognized on the balance sheet.   The ASU will be
effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility plan to adopt this guidance
in the first q uarter of 2019.   PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect this standard to increase lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and do not expect the guidance will have a materi al impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income, Statements of Cash Flows and lease disclosures.

(Subtopic

Recognition
and
Measurement
of
Financial
Assets
and

, which amends the existing guidance relating to the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.   The
amendments require equ ity investments (excluding those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value,
with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The majority of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investmen ts are held in the nuclear decommissioning
trusts.  These investments are classified as “available-for-sale” and gains or losses are refundable, or recoverable, from customers through rates.  The ASU became
effective for PG&E Corporation and t he Utility on January 1, 2018 and will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related
disclosur es .

Revenue
Recognition
Standard

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue
from
Contracts
with
Customers
(Topic
606)
, which amends existing revenue recognition guidance .
The objective of the new standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability
across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capit al markets and to provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved and
expanded disclosure requirements.   The ASU became effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2018.  This standard will be adopted for
related disclosures in the first quarter of 2018 and will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, the
Utility plans to disclose revenues from contracts with customers separately from regulatory ba lancing account revenue and disaggregate customer contract revenue
by customer class.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Utility had current regulatory assets of $615 million and $423 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the
current regulatory assets included $426 million and $223 million, respectively, of costs related to CEMA fire preve ntion and vegetation management.  Curre nt
regulatory assets are included within the current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(1) Represents the cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) recog nized in accordance with

GAAP.

(2) In connection with the settlement agreement entered into among PG &E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC in 2003 to resolve the Utility’s proceeding under Chapter 11, the CPUC
authorized the Utility to recover $ 1.2 billion of costs related to the Utility’s retained generation assets.  The individual components of thes e regulatory assets are being amortized over the
respective lives of the underlying generation facilities, consistent with the period over which the related revenues are recognized.

( 3 ) Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annu al contribution requirements. As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, t he Utility expects to

continuously recover pension benefits.

( 4 ) The change in the balance from a regulatory asset as of December 31, 2016 to a regulatory li ability as of December 31, 2017 reflects the impact of changes in net deferred tax liabilities

associated with a lower federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.  (See “Regulatory Liabilities” below and Note 8.)

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, other long-term regulatory assets included $274 million and $70 million, respectively, of costs related to CEMA events from
2014 through 2017 that the Utility believes are recoverable based on historical experience in recover ing costs for these types of events.

In general, the Utility does not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do not accrue interest.  Accordingly, the Utility earns a return only on its
regulatory assets for retained generation , and unam ortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt.

Regulatory
Balancing
Accounts

The Utility tracks (1) differences between the Utility’s authorized revenue requirement and customer billings, and (2) differences between incurred costs and
customer billings.  To the extent these differences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months, the Utility records a current regulatory balancing
account receivable or payable.     Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a perio d exceeding 12 months are recorded as
other noncurrent assets – regulatory assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences do
not have an impact on net income .  Balancing accou nts will fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs are
incurred and cu stomer revenues are collected.

Pollution
Control
Bonds

The California Pollution Control Financing Authority and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank have issued various series of fixed rate
and multi-modal tax-exempt pollution control bonds for the benefit of the Utility.  Substantially all of the net proceeds of the pollution control bonds were used to
finance or refinance pollution control and sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at the Geysers geothermal power plant or at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant .  In 1999, the Utility sold all bond-financed facilities at the non-retired units of the Geysers geothermal power plant to Geys ers Power
Company, LLC pursuant to purchase and sale s agreements stating that Geysers Power Company, LLC will use the bond-financed facilities solely as pollution
control facilities for so long as any tax-exempt pollution control bonds issued to finance th e Geysers project are outstanding .  Except for components that may
have been abandoned in place or disposed of as scrap or that are permanently non-operational, t he Utility has no knowledge that Geysers Power Company, LLC
intends to cease using the bond-fi nanced facilities solely as pollution control facilities.

Revolving
Credit
Facilities

In May 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility each extended the t ermination dates of their existing revolving credit facilities by one year from April 27, 2021 to
April 27, 2022.   PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital, the repayment of commercial paper, and othe r
corporate purposes.

Borrowings under each credit agreement (other than swingline loans) will bear interest based on the borrower’s credit rating and on each borrower’s election of
either (1) a London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin or (2) the base rate plus an applicable margin.  The base rate will equal the higher
of the following:   the administrative agent’s announced base rate, 0.5% above the overnight federal funds rate, and the one-month LIBOR plus an applicable
margin.   T he borrower’s credit rating at the time of borrowing will determine the applicable rate within the following ranges.   The applicable margin for LIBOR
loans will range between 0.9% and 1.475% under PG&E Corporation’s credit agreement and between 0.8% and 1. 275% under the Utility’s credit agreement.   The
applicable margin for base rate loans will range between 0% and 0.475% under PG&E Corporation’s credit agreement and between 0% and 0.275% under the
Utility’s credit agreement.  In addition, the facility fee under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit agreements will range between 0.1% and 0.275% and
between 0.075% and 0.225%, respectively.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s revolving credit facilities include usual and customary provisions for revol ving credit facilities of this type, including those
regarding events of default and covenants limiting liens to those permitted under their senior note indentures, mergers, sales of all or substantially all of their
assets, and other fundamental changes.  In addition, the respective revolving credit facilities require that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio of total
consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of at most 65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter .  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit facility agreement
also requires that PG&E Corporation own s , directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the outstanding common stock and at least 70% of the outstanding voting capital
stock of the Utility.

Commercial
Paper
Program
s

The borrowings from PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility ’s commercial paper programs are used primarily to fund temporary financing needs.  PG&E
Corporation and the Utility can issue commercial paper up to the maximum amounts of $300 million and $2.5 billion, re spectively.  PG&E Corporation and the
Utility treat the amount of outstanding commercial paper as a reduction to the amount available under their respective revolving credit facilities.  The commercial
paper may have maturities up to 365 days and ranks equ ally with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness.
Commercial paper notes are sold at an interest rate dictated by the market at the time of issuance.   For 2017 , the average yield on outstanding PG&E Corporatio n
and Utility commercial paper was 1.29 % and 1.11 % , respectively .

Other
Short-term
Borrowings

In February 2017, t he Utility’s $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan, issued in March 2016, matured and was repaid.  Additionally, in February 2017, the
Utility entered into a $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan maturing on February 22, 2018.  The procee ds were used for general corporate purposes,
including the repayment of a portion of the Utility’s outstanding commercial paper.

In November 2017, the Utility issued $500 million in unsecured floating rate senior notes that mature on November 28, 2018.  The proceeds were used towards
repayment of the $250 million unsecured floating rate senior notes due November 30, 2017 and the balance was used to support the Northern California wildfire
response efforts.

NOTE

COMMON
STOCK
AND
SHARE-BASED
COMPENSATIO
N

PG&E Corporation had 514,755,845 shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2017 .  PG&E Corporation held all of the Utility’s outstanding common
stock at December 31, 201 7.

In February 2017, PG&E Corporation amended its February 2015 EDA providing for the sale of PG&E Corporation common stock having an aggregate price of up
to $275 million.  During 2017 , PG&E Corporation sold 0.4 million shares of its common stock under the February 2017 EDA for cash proceeds of $ 28.4 million,
net of commissions paid of $ 0.2 million .   There were no issuances under the February 2017 EDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017.  As of
December 31, 2017, the remaining sales available under this agreement were $ 246.3 million.

In addition, during 2017, PG&E Corporation sold 7.4 million shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan,
and share-based compensation plans for total cash proceeds of $ 366.4 million .

111

Dividends

Ordinarily, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility declare dividends quarterly.  Under the Utility’s Articles of Incorporation, the Utility
cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock have been paid.  Under their r espective credit
agreements, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are each required to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated capitalization of at most 65%.  Based
on the calculation of this ratio for each company, no amount of PG&E Corpo ration's retained earnings and $218 million of the Utility's retained earnings was
subject to this restriction at December 31, 2017.  Additionally, the Utility's net assets, and therefore its ability to pay dividends, are restricted by the CPUC-
authorized capital structure, which requires the Utility to maintain, on average, at least 52% equity.  Based on the calculation of this ratio,  $14.3 billion of the
Utility's net assets were restricted at December 31, 2017.  Additionally, as a result of this requirement, the Utility's ability to pay dividends in the future could be
impacted by future potential liabilities.  On December 20, 2017, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation suspended quarter ly cash dividends on PG&E
Corporation’s common stock, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017 due to uncertainty related to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with the
Northern California wildfires.  (See “Northern California Wildfires” i n Note 13 below.)

For the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a common stock dividend of $0.49 per share quarterly.  In May 2017, the Board
of Directors of PG&E Corporation approved a new annual common stock cash dividend of $0.53 per share quarterly.  In 2017, total dividends declared were $1.55
per share.

Long-Term
Incentive
Plan

The PG&E Corporation LTIP permits various forms of share-based incentive awards, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units , performance shares,
and other share-based awards, to eligible employees of PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to
receive certain share-based awards.  A maximum of 1 7 million shares o f PG&E Corporation common stock (subject to certain adjustment s ) has been reserved
for issuance under the 20 14 LTIP, of which 14,327,157 shares were available for future award s at December 31, 2017 .

The following table provides a summary of total share-based compensation expense recognized by PG&E Corporation for share-based incentive awards for 2017 ,
2016 , and 2015 :

The amount of s hare-based compensation costs capitalized during 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 was immaterial .  There was no material difference between PG&E
Corporation and the Utility for the information disclosed above.

Restricted
Stock
Units

R estricted stock units generally vest equally over three year s .   Vested restricted stock units are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock
accompanied by cash payments to settle any divi dend equivalents associated with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generally recognized
rateably over the vesting period based on grant-date fair value .  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units grante d during 2017 , 2016 ,

million, $ 36 million, and $ 57 million, respectively.  The tax benefit from restricted stock units that vested during each period was not material.   In general, f
orfeitures are recorded rateably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to act uals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2017 , $ 33 mil
lion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remai ning weighted average
period of 1.46 years.

Performance shares generally will vest three years after the grant date.  Upon vesting, performance shares are settled in shares of common stock based on either
PG&E Corporation’s total shareholder return relative to a specified group of industry peer companies over a three-year performance period or , for a small number
of awards, an internal PG&E Corpor ation metric .  Dividend equivalents are paid in cash based on the amount of common stock to which the recipients are
entitled.

Compensation expense attributable to performance share is generally recognized rateably over the applicable three-year period based on the grant-date fair value
determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model for the total shareholder return based awards or the grant-date market value o f PG&E Corporation
common stock for internal metric based awards.   The weighted average grant-date fair value for performance shares granted during 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 was $

recorded rateably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.   As of December 31, 2017 , $ 46 million of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance shares was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.42 ye ar

PREFERRED
STOCK

PG&E Corporation has authorized 80 million shares of no par value preferred stock and 5 million shares of $ 100 par value preferred stock , which may be issued
as redeemable or nonredeemable preferred stock.  PG&E Corporation does not have any preferred stock outstanding .

The Utility has authorized 75 million shares of $ 25 par value preferred stock and 10 million shares of $ 100 par value preferred stock.  At December 31, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, the Utility’s preferred stock outstanding included $ 145 million o f shares with interest rates between 5% and 6% designated as nonredeemable
preferred stock and $ 113 million of shares with interest rates between 4.36%   and 5% that are redeemable between $ 25.75 and $ 27.25 per share.  The Utility’s
preferred stock outstanding are not subject to mandatory redemption.  All outstanding preferred stock has a $25 par value.

113

At December 31, 2017 , annual dividends on the Utility’s nonredeemable pre ferred stock ranged from $ 1.25 to $ 1.50 per share.  The Utility’s redeemable
preferred stock is subject to redemption at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends through the redemption date.  At December 31, 2017 , annual d ividends on redeemable preferred stock ranged from $ 1.09 to $ 1.25 per share.

On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of P G&E Corporation and the Utility determined to suspend quarterly cash dividends on the Utility’s preferred
stock, beginning with the three-month period ending January 31, 2018, due to uncertainty related to causes and potential liabilities associated with the October
2017 Northern California wildfir es.  See “Northern California Wildfires” in Note 13 below .)

Dividends on all Utility preferred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights.
Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaid
dividends, as specified for the class and series.   T he Utility paid $ 14 million of dividends on preferred stock in each of 2017, 2016, and 2015.

EARNINGS
PER
SHARE

PG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calculated by dividing the income available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding.  PG& E Corporation applies the treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the calculation of
diluted EPS.  The following is a reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s income available for common shareholders a nd weighted average common shares
outstanding for calculating diluted EPS for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 .

INCOME
TAXES

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The i ncome tax provision includes current and deferred
income taxes resulting from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferred
tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciation
expens e.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the merits of the position.  T he tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based on
the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, t he difference between a tax position taken or expected to
be taken in a t ax return in future periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecognized
tax benefit.

Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation am ortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investment
recovery period.   The Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.

PG&E Corporation files a consolidated U.S. f ederal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more.
PG&E Corporation files a combined state income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agr eement under which
the Utility determines its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis.

(1) Includes the effect of state flow -through ratemaking treatment.  In 2016 and 2015, amounts reflect an agreement with the IRS on a 2011 audit related to electric transmission and distribution

repairs deductions.  The 2017 amount reflects an agreement with the IRS on a 2013 audit related to generati on repairs deductions.

decision which impacted 2016 and 2017.  All amounts are impacted by the level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC and 2015 GT&S rate case decisions authorized revenue
requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these
temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefor e, PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or
liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be r ecovered from or returned to customers in future rates.

The component of unre cognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 31, 2017 for PG &E Corporation and the Utility
was $ 21 million .

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s unrecognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months due to the resolution of several matters,
including audits.   As of December 31, 2017, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $ 20 million within the next 12
months.

Interest income, interest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of In come.  For t
he years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016, and 201 5 , these amounts were immaterial.

Tax
Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
of
2017

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act.  Among other provi sions, the Tax Act
reduces the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminated bonus depreciation for utilities.  The Tax Act
required PG&E Corporation and the Utility to re-measure all existing deferred in come tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal tax rate.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have made reasonable estimates to reflect the impacts of the Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts, in accordance with
rules issued by th e SEC in Staff Account ing Bulletin No. 118 , for the re-measurement of deferred tax balances as of December 31, 2017.

During the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation, on a consolidated basis, recorded a one-time provisional tax expense of $147
million to reflect the transitional impacts of the Tax Act.  Of this amount, $83 million is attributable to the re-measurement of PG&E Corporation’s net deferred tax
asset comprised primarily of net operating loss carry-forwards and compen sation-related items.  The remaining $64 million is related to the re-measurement of the
Utility’s deferred taxes not reflected in authorized revenue requirements, such as disallowed plant.  The Utility also recorded a provisional $5. 7 billi on re-
measurement of its deferred tax balances (related to flow-through and normalized timing differences for plant-related items) which was offset by a change from a
net deferred income tax regulatory asset to a net regulatory liability.  The deferred inc ome tax regulatory liability will be refunded to customers over the regulatory
lives of the related assets.

117

The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the above recorded amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, regulato ry decisions
from the CPUC that could differ from the Utility’s determination of how the impacts of the Tax Act are allocated between customers and shareholders.  In addition,
while PG&E Corporation and the Utility were able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in federal tax rate and the elimination of bonus
depreciation due to the enactment of the Tax Act; changes in interpretations, guidance on legislative intent, and any changes in accounting standards for income
taxes in response to the Tax Act could impact the recorded amounts.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility will finalize and record any adjustments related to the Tax
Act within the one year measurement period provided under S taff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 .

Tax
Settlements

PG& E Corporation’s tax returns have been accepted through 2015 except for a few matters, the most significant of which relates to deductible repair costs for gas
transmission and distribution lines of business.   In February 2017, the Joint Committee of Taxati on approved PG&E Corporation’s settlement with the IRS related
to deductible electric transmission and distribution repairs for the 2011 and 2012 tax years.   The agreement provided that the methodology used in determining the
deductible amount should be fo llowed for all subsequent periods, absent any material change in facts.   In November 2017, PG&E Corporation reached an
agreement with the IRS on deductible generation repairs for the 2013 and 2014 tax years.   The IRS may issue guidance in 2018 that clarifi es which repair costs
are deductible for the natural gas transmission and distribution lines of business.

Tax years after 2008 remain subject to examination by the state of California.

2015
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Case

The final phase two de cision reduced rate base by the full amount of the disallowed capital expenditures but did not remove the associated deferred taxes, which
the Utility believes constitutes a normalization violation.  In the final decision, the CPUC authorized the Utility t o establish a Tax Normalization Memorandum
Account to track relevant costs and clarified that it is the CPUC’s intention that the Utility comply with normalization rules and avoid the potential adverse
consequences of a normalization violation.  The CPUC a llowed the Utility to seek a ruling from the IRS and the Utility filed the ruling request with the IRS on
April 10, 2017.  On October 5, 2017, the IRS issued a private letter ruling indicating the final decision rate base reduction was inconsistent with the IRS tax
normalization requiremen ts.  As a result of the IRS private letter ruling, the Utility filed an advice letter with the CPUC on December 11, 2017, requesting a rate
base adjustment of $7 million, $28 million, $49 million, and $61 million, in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.

PG&E Corporation believes it is more likely than not the tax benefits associated with the federal and California net operating loss es, charitable contributions and

NOTE
9:
DERIVATIVES

Use
of
Derivative
Instruments

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities.  Procurement costs are recovered through
customer rates.  The Utility uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatili ty in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.
Derivatives include contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs .

Derivatives are presented in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets recorded at fa ir value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangements for
each counterparty.  The fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offset
exist.

Price risk management activities that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These instruments are not
held for speculative purposes and are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Uti lity expects to fully recover in rates all costs related to derivatives under
the applicable ratemaking mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.
Therefore, all unreali zed gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s regulatory
assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives a re recorded in the cost of electricity or the cost
of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.

The Utility elects the normal purchase and sale exception for eligible d erivatives.  Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that are
expected to be used by the Utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commodity
delivered.  These items are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Eligible derivatives are accounted for under the accrual method of
accounting.

( 1) Unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk-related derivative instruments are recorded to regulatory liabilities or assets, respectively, rather than being recorded to the Consolidated

Statements of Income.  These amounts exclude the impact of cash collateral postings.

( 2) These amounts are fully passed through to customers in rates.  Accordingly, net income was not impacted by realized amounts on these instruments.

Cash inflows and outflows associated with derivatives are included i n operating cash flows on the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The majority of the Utility’s derivatives contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies .   At
December 31, 2017 , the Utility’s credit rating was investment grade.  If the Utility’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be
required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some of its net liability derivative positions.

T he additional cash collateral that the Utility would be required to post if the credit risk-related contingency features were triggered was as follows:

(in
millions)
Derivatives in a liability position with credit risk-related
contingencies that are not fully collateralized
Related derivatives in an asset position

NOTE
10:
FAIR
VALUE
MEASUREMENTS

PG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their cash equivalents, trust assets and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair value
hierarchy is establ ished that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value :

Level

1
–
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level

2
–
Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

Level

3
–
Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.

120

The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable in puts when measuring fair value.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below .  A ssets held in rabbi trusts are held
by PG&E Corporation and not the Utility .

V
aluation
Techniques

The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabi lities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions on
the terms and conditions upon which the investments may be redeemed.  Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of the end of the
reporting period.   There were no material transfers between any lev els for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .

122

Trust
Assets

Assets
Measured
at
Fair
Value

In general, investments held in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks.  N uclear decommissioning trust
assets and other trust assets are composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investments that are money market funds
valued at Level 1 .

Global e quity securi ties primarily include i nvestments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.

Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including
corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is
determined by observable market prices in acti ve markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified as
Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model
generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation
model, as applicable.

Assets
Measured
at
NAV
Using
Practical
Expedient

Investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient
have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts
presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges
as well as fixed-inc ome securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities.

Price
Risk
Management
Instruments

Price risk management instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreem ents, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and
CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.

Power purchase agreements, forwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using obs ervable
market forward prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures,
or are valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with marke t data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded and over-the-counter
options are valued using observable market data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2.

Long-dated power purchase agreements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued using
either estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond a
period for which market data is available.   Market and credit risk ma nagement utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3
instruments using pricing inputs from br okers and historical data.

The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISO
auction and between auction dates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices .  CRRs are classif ied as Level 3.

Level
3
Measurements
and
Sensitivity
Analysis

The Utility’s market and credit risk m anagement function, which reports to the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for determining the fair value of the Utility’s
price risk manag ement de rivatives.  The Utility’s finance and risk management functions collaborate to determine the appropriate fair value methodologies and
classification for each derivative.  Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to
determine reasonableness.

123

Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related to
Level 3 instruments are expected to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value of
these instruments.   (See Note 9 above.)

Financial
Instruments

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value for financial instruments:

The fair values of cash , restricted cash , net accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, customer deposits, floating rate senior notes,
and the Utility’s variable rate pollution control bond loan agreement s approximate their carrying values at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , as they are
short-term in nature or ha ve interest rates that reset daily .

The fair values of the Utility’s fixed - rate senior notes and fixed - rate pollution control bond s and PG&E Corporation’s fixed - rate senior notes were
based on quoted market prices at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .

The carrying amount and fair value of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s debt instruments were as follows (the table below excludes financial instruments with

PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees hired before December 31, 2012 and a cash
balance plan for those eligible employees hired after this date or who made a one-time election to participate (“Pension Plan”).  T he trusts underlying certain of
these plans are qualified trusts under the Interna l Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.   If certain conditions are met, PG&E Corporation and the Utility can deduct
payments made to the qualified trusts, subject to certain limitations.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy is to contribute tax -deductible amounts,
consistent with applicable regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  Based upon current assumptions and available information, the Utility
’s minimum funding requirements related to its pension plans is zero .

126

PG &E Corporation and the Utility also sponsor contributory postretirement medical plans for retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory
postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees.  PG&E Corporation and the Utilit y use a fiscal year-end measurement date for all plans.

Components
of
Accumulated
Other
Comprehensive
Income

PG&E Corporation and the Utility record unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses related to pension and post-retirement benefits other
than pension as components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax .  In addition, regulatory adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated
Statements of Incom e and Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the difference between expense or income calculated in accordance with GAAP for accounting
purposes and expense or income for ratemaking purposes, which is based on authorized plan contributions.   For pension be nefits, a regulatory asset or liability is
recorded for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.   For post-retirement benefits other than pension, the Utility
generally records a regulatory liability for amounts t hat would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.   As the Utility is unable to
record a regulatory asset for these other benefits, the charge remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The estimated amounts that wil l be amortized into net periodic benefit cost s for PG&E Corporation in 2018 are as follows:

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by determining projected stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset
allocations of the employee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on pl an assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were
projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were estimated based on estimates of
dividend yield and real earnings growth a dded to a long-term inflation rate .  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 6.2 % compares to a ten-year actual
return of 7.8 %.  The rate used to discount pension benefits and ot her benefit s was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 623
Aa-grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2017 .  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future
cash flows for the pension benefits and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average dis count
rate.

Investment
Policies
and
Strategies

The financial position of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit
obligations.  Volatility in funde d status occurs wh en asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial
reporting , as well as the amount of minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended .  P G&E Co
rporation’s and the Utility’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of funded
status volatility.

The trusts ’ asset allocations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings .   Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants
of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interes t rate changes
also influence liability valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility , PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trust s hold
significant allocations in long maturity fixed-income investments . A lthough they co ntribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce
long-term funding costs due to their higher expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust ’s holdings in equity and
fixed-income inve stments by exhibiting returns with low correlation to the direction of these markets.   R eal assets include commodities futures, global REITS,
and global listed infrastructure equities.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios .

130

Derivative instruments such as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure.   Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S. treasury
futures, are also used to rebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio.   F oreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion
of the non U.S. dollar exposure of global equity investments.

The target asset allocation percentages for major categories of trust assets for pension and other benefit plans are as follows:

PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guiding
principles of this risk management framework are the clear articulation of roles an d responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountability
and documentation.  Trust investment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversification, manage risk
through appropriat e use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.

Valuation
Techniques

The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tabl e above.   All investments that are
valued using a NAV per share can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.

Short-Term
Investments

Short-term investments consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors.  These securities are categorized as Level 1
and Level 2 assets.

Global
Equity

The global equity category include s investments in common stock and equity-index futures .  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on public
exchanges and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active mar kets for identical
securities.  Equity-index futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets .

Real
Assets

The real asset category includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS and global listed infrastructure equities .  The commodity futures, global REITS,
and global listed infrastructure equities are actively traded on a publ ic exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.

Fixed-Income

Fixed-income   securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including
corporate debt securities.   U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value
is determined by observable market prices in active markets.   A market approach is generally used to estimate the fa ir value of debt securities classified as Level 2
using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.   Significant inputs used in the valuation model
generally include benchmark yield curves and i ssuer spreads.   The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the
valuation model, as applicable.

Assets
Measured
at
NAV
Using
Practical
Expedient

Investments in the trusts that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables
above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These inv
estments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges as well as fixed-income securities that are composed
primarily of U.S. government securities, asset-backed securities, and private real estate funds.  The re are no restrictions on the terms and conditions upon which
the investments may be redeemed.

Transfers
Between
Levels

Any transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of the en d of the reporting period.  No material transfer s between levels occurred in the
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .

PG&E Corporati on and the Utility contributed $ 335 million to the pension benefit plans and $ 33 mill ion to the other benefit plans in 2017 .  These contributions
are consistent with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicable
regulatory de cisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  None of these pension or other benefits were subject to a minimum funding requirement
requiring a cash contribution in 2017 .  The Utility’s pension benefits met all the funding requi rements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act .
PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 327 million and $ 24 million to the pension plan and other postretirement
benefit plans, respectively, for 2018 .

NOTE
13:
CONTINGENCIES
AND
COMMITMENTS

PG &E Cor poration and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigation
matters and environmental remediation . A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both prob able that a loss has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the
lower end of the range, unless an amount with in the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably
possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss con tingencies are reviewed
quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of
legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a parti cular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes
anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred .   The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection with agreements entered into to
suppo rt its operating activities.   See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation has financial commitments described in “Other Commitments” below.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be mate rially affected by the outcome of the following
matters.

Enforcement
and
Litigation
Matters

Northern
California
Wildfires

Beginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wildfires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte, Lake,
Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City.  According to the Cal Fire California Statewide Fire Summary dated October   30, 2017,
at the peak of th e wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres, resulted in 43 fatalities, and destroyed an
estimated 8,900 structures.  Subsequently, the number of fatalities increased to 44.

The Utility incurred $ 219 million in costs for service restoration and repair to the Utility’s facilities (including $97 million in capital expenditures) through
December 31, 2017 in connection with these fires.  While the Utility believes that such costs are recoverable through C EMA , its CEMA requests are subject to
CPUC approval.  The Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to recover
such costs.

The fires are being investigated by Cal Fire and the CPUC , including the possible role of the Utility ’s power lines and other facilities.   The Utility expects that
Cal Fire will issue a report or reports stating its conclusions as to the sources of ignition of the fires and the ways that they pr ogressed.  The CPUC’s SED also is
conducting investigations to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules and regulations in fire impacted
areas.  According to information made available by the CPUC, inve stigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities, vegetation
management, and emergency preparedness and response.   Various other entities, including fire departments, may also be investigating certain of the fires.  (For
example, on February 3, 2018, it was reported that investigators with the Santa Rosa Fire Department had completed their investigation of two small fires that
reportedly destroyed two homes and damaged one outbuilding and had concluded that the Utility’s facilitie s, along with high wind and other factors, contributed to
those fires.)  It is uncertain when the investigations will be complete and whether Cal Fire will release any preliminary findings before its investigation is complete.

As of January 31, 2018 , the Utility had submitted 22 e lectric incident reports to the CPUC associated with the Northern California wildfires where Cal Fire has
identified a site as potentially involving the Utility’s facilities in its investigation and the property damage associated with each incident exceeded $50,000.  The
information contained in these reports is factual and preliminary, and does not reflect a determination of the causes of the fires.   The in vestigations into the fires
are ongoing.

If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse
condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the
aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility .  California c ourts have imposed liability under the
doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was
damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from su ch undertaking and based on the assumption that utilities
have the ability to recover these costs from their customers.  Further, courts could determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence
of an open CPUC proceeding for co st recovery, or before a potential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC.  There is no guarantee that the CPUC would
authorize cost recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies.  In addition t o such claims for property
damage, interest and attorneys’ fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, and other
damages under other theories of liability, including if the Util ity were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have
a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility .   Further, the Utility could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any other law
enforcement agency brought an enforcement action and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

135

Given the preliminary stages of investigations and the uncertainty as to the causes of the fires, PG&E Corpor ation and the Utility do not believe a loss is probable
at this time.  However, it is reasonably possible that facts could emerge through the course of the various investigations that lead PG&E Corporation and the Utility
to believe that a loss is probable , resulting in an accrued liability in the future, the amount of which could be material.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently
are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of losses (or range of amounts) that they could incur given the preliminary s tages of the investigations and the
uncertainty regarding the extent and magnitude of potential damages. On January 31, 2018 , the California Department of Insurance issued a press release
announcing an update on property losses in connection with the Octo ber and December wildfires in California, stating that, as of such date, “insurers have
received nearly 45,000 insurance claims totaling more than $11.79 billion in losses,” of which approximately $10 billion relates to statewide claims from the
October 20 17 wildfires.  The remaining amount relates to claims from the Southern California December 2017 wildfires.  According to the California Department
of Insurance, as of the date of the press release, more than 21,000 homes, 3,200 businesses, and more than 6 ,100 vehicles, watercraft, farm vehicles, and other
equipment were damaged or destroyed by the October 2017 wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not independently verified these estimates.  The
California Department of Insurance did not state in its press release whether it intends to provide updated estimates of losses in the future.

If the Utility’s facilities are determined to be the cause of one or more of the Northern California wildfires, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for
the related property losses and other damages.  The California Departmen t of Insurance January 31, 2018 press release reflects insured property losses only.  The
press release does not account for uninsured losses, interest, attorneys’ fees, fire suppr ession costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury and
wrongful death damages or other costs.   If the Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of such other costs and expenses, the amount of PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s lia bility could be higher than the approximately $10 billion estimated in respect of the wildfires that occurred in October 2017,
depending on the extent of the damage in connection with such fire or fires.  As a result, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s f inancial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

As of January 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of 111 lawsuits, six of which seek to be certified as class action s , that have been fil ed
against PG&E Corporation and the Utility in the Sonoma, Napa and San Francisco Counties Superior Courts.  The lawsuits allege, among other things, negligence,
inverse condemnation, trespass, and private nuisance.  They principally assert that PG&E Corpo ration’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to maintain and repair
their distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the fires .   The plaintiffs seek
damages that include wrong ful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and other
damages.  In addition, insurance carriers who have made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the fires ha ve filed three subrogation
complaints in the San Francisco County Superior Court .
  These complaints allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation, trespass and nuisance.
The allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs.   On October 31, 2017, a group of plaintiffs submitted a petition for coordination to the Chair
of the Judicial Council of California and requested coordination of the litigation in the San Francisco Superior Court.  On November 9, 2017, PG&E Corporation a
nd the Utility submitted a petition for coordination to the Chair of the Judicial Council of California, and requested separate coordination in the counties in which
the fires occurred.  On January 4, 2018, the coordination motion judge of the San Francisc o Superior Court entered an order granting coordination of the litigation
in connection with the Northern California wildfires and recommending that the coordinated proceeding take place in the San Francisco Superior Court.  On
January 12, 2018, the Judici al Council of California accepted the coordination motion judge’s recommendation and assigned the coordinated proceeding to San
Francisco.  The first case management conference is scheduled for February 27, 2018.

In addition, two derivative lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court on November   16,
2017 and November   20, 2017, respectively.  The first lawsuit is filed against the members of the Board of Directors and certain officers of PG&E Corporation .
PG&E Corporation is identified as a nominal defendant in that action.   The second lawsuit is filed against the members of the Board of Directors, certain former
members of the Board of Directors, and certain officers of both PG&E Corp oration and the Utility .   PG&E Corporation and the Utility are identified as nominal
defendants in that action.   Motions to consolidate the two lawsuits, appoint lead plaintiffs’ counsel, and enter a case schedule are currently pending.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to be the subject of additional lawsuits in connection with the Northern California wildfires.   The wildfire litigation
could take a number of years to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters, including the ongoing inve stigation into the causes of the fires and the
growing number of parties and claims involved.  The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability
attributable to the Northern California wildfires in an aggregate amount of approximately $800 million.  If the Utility were to be found liable for one or more fires,
the Utility's insurance could be insufficient to cover that liability, depending on the extent of the damage in connection with such fire or fires.    Following the
Northern California wildfires, PG&E Corporation reinstated its liability insurance in the amount of approximately $630   million for any potential future event.

136

In addition, it could take a number of years before the Utility’s final liability is known and the Utility could apply for cost recovery.  The Utility may be unable to
recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a num ber
of years thereafter to collect.  Further, SB 819, introduced in the California Senate in January 2018, if it becomes law, would prohibit utilities from recovering costs
in excess of insurance resulting from damages caused by such utilities’ facilities, if the CPUC determines that the utility did not reasonably construct, maintain,
manage, control, or operate the facilities.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have considered certain actions that might be taken to attempt to address liquidity
needs of the business in such circumstances, but the inability to recover costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a
timely manner, or any negative assessment by the Utility of the likelihood or timeliness of such recovery and collection, could have a material adverse effect on
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Connection
with
the
Butte
Fire

In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the “Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California.  On April 28, 2016, Cal
Fire   released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire. According to Cal Fire’s repo rt, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in two
fatalities, destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commercial properties, and damaged 44 structures.  Cal Fire’s   report concluded that the wildfire was
caused when a gray p ine tree contacted   the Uti lity’s   electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility   and/or its
vegetation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc.,   to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to
the failure of the tree.

Third-Party
Claims

On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of Californ
ia for Sacramento County.   Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.   The California Judicial Council had previously
authorized the coordination of all cases in Sacramento County.   As of December 3 1 , 2017, 77 known compl aints have been filed against the Utility and its two
vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador.  The complaints
involve approximately 3,770 individual plaintif fs representing approximately 2 ,030 households and their insurance companies.   These complaints are part of or
are in the process of being added to the two master complaints.   Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on the doc trine of inverse
condemnation and negligence theor y of liability.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages.  As of December 31, 2017, several plaintiffs have dismissed the Utility’s
two vegetation management contractors.  The number of individual complaints and plaintiffs may still increase in the future , because the statute of limitations for
property damages in connection with the Butte fire has not yet expired .  (The statute of limitations for personal injury in connection with the Butte fire has
expired.)   The Utility continues mediating and settling cases.

In addition, on April 13, 2017, Cal Fire filed a complaint with the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Calaveras, seeking to recover $87 million for
its costs incurred on the theory t hat the Utility and its vegetation management contractors were negligent, among other claims.   On July 31, 2017, Cal Fire
dismissed its complaint against Tree’s, Inc., one of the Utility’s vegetation contractors.  The Utility and Cal Fire are currently eng aged in a mediation process.

Further , in May 2017, the OES indicated that it intends to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimates in the approximate amount of $190 million.  This claim
would include costs incurred by the OES for tree and debr is removal, infrastructure damage, erosion control, and other claims related to the Butte fire.  Also, in
June 2017, the County of Calaveras indicated that it intends to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimates in the approximate amount of $85 m illion.  This
claim would include costs that the County of Calaveras incurred or expects to incur for infrastructure damage, erosion control, and other costs related to the Butte
fire.

On April 28, 2017, the Utility moved for summary adjudication on plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages.  On August 10, 2017, the Court denied the Utility’s
motion on the grounds that plaintiffs might be able to show con scious disregard for public safety based on the fact that the Utility relied on contractors to fulfill
their contractual obligation to hire and train qualified employees.  On August 16, 2017, the Utility filed a writ with the Court of Appeals challenging w hat the
Utility believes is a novel theory of punitive damages liability.  The Court of Appeals accepted the writ on September 15, 2017 and ordered the trial court and
plaintiffs to show cause why the relief requested by the Utility should not be granted. Briefing on the writ was completed as of January 2, 2018 .   The Utility is
seeking expedited review of the motion.

137

On June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento ruled on a motion of several plaintiffs and found that the doctrine of inv erse condemnation
applies to the Utility with respect to the Butte fire.  The court held, among other things, that the Utility had failed to put forth any evidence to support its contention
that the CPUC would not allow the Utility to pass on its inverse c ondemnation liability through rate increases .  While the ruling is binding only between the
Utility and the plaintiffs in the coordination proceeding, others could file lawsuits and make similar claims.  On January 4, 2018, the Utility filed with the court a
renewed motion for a legal determination of inverse condemnation liability, citing the November 30, 2017 CPUC decision denying the San Diego Gas & Electric
Company application to recover wildfire costs in excess of insurance, and the CPUC declaration tha t it will not automatically allow utilities to spread inverse
condemnation losses through rate increases.  The motion is set for hearing on March 15, 2018.

Estimated
Losses
from
Third-Party
Claims

In connection with this matter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through the
doctrine of inverse condemnation.

In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent.
While the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court or jury would agree with the Utility.

The Utility currently believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss of at least $1.1 billion, increased from the $750 million previously estimated as of
December 31, 2016, in connection with the Butte fire.  The Utility’s updated estimate resulted primarily from an increase in the number of claims filed against the
Utility and experience to date in resolving claims.  This amount is based on updated assumptions about the number, size, and type of structures damaged or
destroyed, the contents of such structures, the number and types of tree s damaged or destroyed, as well as assumptions about personal injury damages, attorneys’
fees, fire suppression costs, and certain other damages, but does not include punitive damages for whi ch the Utility could be liable.  In addition, w hile this amount
i ncludes the Utility’s assumptions about fire suppression costs (including its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any significant portion of the
estimated claims from the OES and the County of Calaveras.   The Utility still does not have s ufficient information to reasonably estimate the probable loss it may
have for these additional claims.

The Utility currently is unable to reasonably estimate the upper end of the range of losses due to the uncertainty of pending legal motions related to the
applicability of inverse condemnation and punitive damages and because it has insufficient information on the claims of over 1,000 households and the claims from
the OES and the County of Calaveras.  The process for estimating costs associated with clai ms relating to the Butte fire requires management to exercise
significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors.  As more information becomes known, including additional discovery from the
plaintiffs, results from the ongoing med iation and settlement process, review of potential claims from the OES and the County of Calaveras, outcomes of future
court or jury decisions, and information about damages, including punitive damages, that the Utility could be liable for, management esti mates and assumptions
regarding the financial impact of the Butte fire may result in materia l increases to the loss accrued.

The following table presents changes in the third-party claims liability since December 31, 2015.  The balance for the third-party claims liability is included in

(1) As of December 31 , 2017 the Utility entered into settlement agreements in connection with the Butte fire corresponding to approximat ely $ 624 million of which
   $ 539 million has been paid by the Utility.

In addition to the amounts reflected in the table above, the Utility has incurred cumulative legal expenses of $ 87 million in connection with the Butte fire.   For the
year ended December 31, 2017, the Utility has incurred legal expenses in connection with the Butte fire of $60 million.

Loss
Recoveries

The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Butte fire in an aggregate amount of $9
22 million.  The Utility records insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that a recovery will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its
range.  Through December 31, 2017, the Utility recorded $ 922 m illion for probable insurance recoveries in connection with losses related to the Butte fire.  While
the Utility plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.  In addition , in the year
ended December 31, 2017, the Utility received $53 million of reimbursements from the insurance polic ies of one of its vegetation management contractors (
excluded from t he table below) . Recoveries of additional amounts under the insurance pol icies of the Utility’s vegetation management contractor s , including
policies where the Utility is listed as an add itional insured, are uncertain.

The following table presents changes in the insurance receivable since December 31, 2015.  The balance for th e insurance receivable is included in Other accounts

If the Utility records losses in connection with claims relating to the Butte fire that materially exceed the amount the Utility accrued for these liabilities, PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affe cted in the reporting periods during which
additional charges are recorded, depending on whether the Utility is able to record or collect insurance recoveries in amounts sufficient to offset such additional
accruals.

Regulatory
Citations

On April 25, 201 7, the SED issued two citations to the Utility in connection with the Butte fire, totaling $8.3 million.  The SED’s investigation found that neither
the Utility nor its vegetation management contractors took appropriate steps to prevent the gray pine from leaning and contacting the Utility’s electric line, which
created an unsafe and dangerous condition that resulted in that tree leaning and making contact with the electric line, thus causing a fire.  The Utility paid the
citations in June 2017.

Enforceme
nt
Matters

In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedly
improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel.  The Utility has coop era ted with those investigations.  It is uncertain whether any charges will
be brought against the Utility as a result of these investigations.

CPUC
Matters

with
Ex

Communication
Rules

During 2014 and 2015, the Utility filed several reports to notify the CPUC of communications that the Utility believes may have constituted or described ex parte
communications that either should not have occurred or that should have been timely reported to the C PUC.  Ex parte communications include communications
between a decision maker or a commissioner’s advisor and interested persons concerning substantive issues in certain formal proceedings.  Certain
communications are prohibited and others are permissible with proper noticing and reporting.

On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Utility should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule
1.1 of the CPUC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure governing the conduct of those appearing before the CPUC.  The OII cites some of the communications the
Utility reported to the CPUC.  The OII also cites the ex parte violations alleged in the City of San Bruno’s July 2014 motion, which it filed in CPUC investigatio ns
related to the Utility’s natural gas transmission pipeline operations and practices.

139

On March, 28, 2017, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, ORA, the SED, TURN, and the Utility jointly submitted to the CPUC a settlement agreement in
connection wi th the OII into the Utility’s compliance with the CPUC’s ex parte communication rules.  On September 1, 2017, the assigned administrative law
judge issued a PD in this proceeding adopting, with one modification, the settlement agreement jointly submitted to the CPUC on March 28, 2017, by the Utility,
the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, the ORA, the SED, and TURN.

If adopted, the PD would increase the payment to the California General Fund , relative to the settlement agreement, from $1 million to $12 mil lion resulting in a
total penalty of $97.5 million comprised of: (1) a $12 million payment to the California General Fund, (2) forgoing collection of $63.5 million of GT&S revenue
requirements for the years 2018 ($31.75 million) and 2019 ($31.75 million), (3) a $10 million one-time revenue requirement adjustment to be amortized in
equivalent annual amounts over the Utility’s next GRC cycle (i.e., the GRC following the 2017 GRC), and (4) compensation payments to the Cities of San Bruno
and San Carlos in a to tal amount of $12 million ($6 million to each city).  In addition, the settlement agreement provides for certain non-financial remedies,
including enhanced noticing obligations between the Utility and CPUC decision-makers, as well as certification of emplo yee training on the CPUC ex parte
communication rules.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, customers will bear no costs associated with the financial remedies set forth above.

On September 21, 2017, the Utility submitted a motion to the CPUC ac cepting the proposed modification of the settlement agreement to increase the Utility’s
payment to the California General Fund from $1 million to $12 million.  Further, the Utility also reported that it has identified several communications that appear
to r aise issues similar to other communications that are part of this proceeding.

On November 1, 2017, the Utility filed a status report advising the CPUC that the Utility and the non-Utility parties to the settlement agreement were unable to
reach an agreem ent with respect to how to proceed regarding the communications that the Utility reported to the CPUC on September 21, 2017.   Also on
November 1, 2017, the non-Utility parties to the settlement requested that the CPUC approve the settlement, as modified by the PD, and open a second phase of the
OII to investigate and consider appropriate sanctions for the new communications reported by the Utility on September 21, 2017, and others that may be
discovered.

On November 30, 2017, the CPUC issued a decision ex tending the statutory deadline to June 29, 2018 to resolve the proceeding.  The CPUC stated that an
extension of the statutory deadline was necessary to allow the assigned administrative law judge time to prepare the revised decision and to open and resolve a
second phase of this proceeding.

The Utility is unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding.

At December 31, 2017, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a $24 million accrual for the amounts payable to the Cali fornia
General Fund and the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos.  In accordance with accounting rules, adjustments related to revenue requirements would be recorded in
the periods in which they are incurred.

Natural
Gas
Transmission
Pipeline
Rights-of-Way

In 2012, the Utility notified the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address a
self-reported violation whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipeline
rights-of-way.   The Utility also submitted a proposed compliance plan that s et forth the scope and timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachments
over a multi-year period and to pay penalties if the proposed milestones were not met.   In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey had been
completed and tha t remediation work, including removal of the encroachments, was expected to continue for several years.  The SED has not addressed the
Utility’s proposed compliance plan, and it is reasonably possible that the SED will impose fines on the Utility in the fut ure based on the Utility’s failure to
continuously survey its system and remove encroachments.  The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be
incurred given the SED’s wide discretion and the number of fact ors that can be considered in determining penalties.

140

Potential
Safety
Citations

The SED periodically audits utility operating practices and conducts investigations of potential violations of laws and regulations applicable to the safety of the
California utilities’ electric and natural g as facilities and operations.  The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issue citations and impose penalties for
violations identified through audits, investigations, or self -reports.  There are a number of audit find ings, as well as other potential violations identified through
various investigations and the Utility’s self-reported non-compliance with laws and regulations, on which the SED has yet to act.  Under both the gas and electric
programs, the SED has discreti on whether to iss ue a penalty for each violation.

The SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory
penalty of $50,000, with an administrativ e limit of $8 million per citation issued.  The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than
a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day.  The SED also has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of
the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and the
good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve c ompliance, after notification of a violation.  The SED also is required to consider the appropriateness of
the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.  Historically, t he SED has exercised broad discretion in determining whether violations are continuing
and the amount of penalties to be imposed.  In the past, t he SED has imposed fines on the Utility ranging from $50,000 to $16.8 million for violations of electric
and natural gas laws and regulations.   The CPUC can also open an OII and levy additional fines even after the SED has issued a citation.

The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges as a result of SED investigations or any proceedings that could be commenced in
connection with potential viola tions of electric and natural gas laws and regulations.

Other
Matters

Other
Contingencies

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various claims, lawsuits and regulatory proceeding s that separately are not considered material .  Accruals for
contingencies related to such matters (excluding amounts related to the contingencies discussed above under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” ) totaled $86
million at December 31, 2017 and $45 million at Decembe r 31, 2016.  These amounts are included in O ther current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash
flows.

Disallowance
of
Plant
Costs

PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred for recently completed plant will not be recoverable through rates
and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  Capital disallowance s are reflected in operating and maintenance expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income .  Disallowances as a result of the CPUC’s June 2016 final phase one decision and December 2016 final phase two decision in the Utility’s
2015 GT&S rate case , the Utility’s Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, and CPUC’s final decision on the closure of Diablo Canyon are discussed below.

On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decision in the Ut ility’s 2015 GT&S rate case.  The phase one decision excluded from rate base $696
million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted.  The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and ordered
that the remaini ng $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding.
The decision also established various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the current ra te case cycle including new one-way balancing accounts.
As a result, in 2016, the Utility incurred charges of $219 million for capital expenditures that the Utility believes are probable of disallowance based on the decisi
on.  This included $134 million for 2011 through 2014 capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts and $85 million for the Utility’s estimate of 2015 through
2018 capital expenditures that are probable of exceeding authorized amounts.  Additional charges may be required in the future b ased on the Utility’s ability to
manage its capital spending and on the outcome of the CPUC’s audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending.

PSEP-related capital costs, of which $665 million was expensed in previous years for costs that are expected t o exceed the authorized amount.  The Utility expects
the remaining PSEP work to co ntinue throughout 2018.  The Utility would be required to record charges in future periods to the extent PSEP-related capital costs
are higher than currently expected.

On January 11, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting the settlement agreement jointly submitted to the CPUC in May 2017 related to the recovery of
license renewal costs and cancelled project costs within the Utility’s ap plication to retire Diablo Canyon.  The final decision allows for recovery from customers of
$18.6 million of the total license renewal project cost of $53 million evenly over an 8-year period beginning January 1, 2018.  Related to cancelled project costs,
the decision allows for recovery from customers of 100% of the direct costs incurred prior to June 30, 2016 and 25% recovery of direct costs incurred after June
30, 2016.  During the year ended December 31 , 2017, th e Utility incurred charges of $47 million related to the Diablo Canyon capital expenditures settlement
agreement, of which $24 million is for cancelled projects and $23 million is for disallowed license renewal costs.   The Utility does not expect to incur additional
charges as a result of the CPUC ’s final decision, other than additional project cancellation costs that the Utility does not expect to be material.

Environm
ental
Remediation
Contingencies

Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for
est imating remediation liabilities requires significant judgment.   The Utility records an environmental remediation liability w hen the site assessments indicate
that remediation is probable and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts.  The Utility records an environmental remediation
liability based on the lower end of the range of estimated pro bable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.   Key
factors that inform the development of estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations a nd maint
enance activities, post- remediation monitoring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site .  Amounts recorded are not
discounted to their present value.  The Utility’s environmental remediation liability is primaril y included in non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and is composed of the following:

(in
millions)
Topock natural gas compressor station
Hinkley natural gas compressor station
Former manufactured gas plant sites owned by the Utility or third parties (1)

The Utility’s gas compressor stations, former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the stor age,
recycling, and disposal of potentially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the state and federal regulatory agencies under the federal
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and/or other state hazardous waste laws.   The Utility has a comprehensive program in place designed to comply with
federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility
assesses and monitors, on an ongoing basis, measures that may be necessary to comply with these laws and regulations and implements changes to its program as
deemed appropriate.  The Utility’s remediation activities are overseen by the DTSC, several California regional water qu ality control boards, and various other
federal, state, and local agencies.

The Utility’s environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2017 reflects its best estimate of probable future costs associated with its final remediation plan.
Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work to implement final remediation plans and the Utility’s required time frame for remediat ion.
The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows during the period in which they are recorded.  At December 31, 2017 , the Utility expected to recover $ 725 million of its
environmental remediation liabil ity through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by the CPUC.

Natural
Gas
Co
mpressor
Station
Sites

The Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas
compressor stations.  The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.

Topock
Site

The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the DTSC and the DOI. In November 2015, the Utility
submitted its final remediation design to the agencies for approval.  The Utility’s design proposes that the Utility construct an in-situ groundwater treatment system
to convert hexavalent chromium int o a non-toxic and non-soluble form of chromium.  On December 21, 2017 the DTSC issued its final environmental impact
report.  The environmental impact report includes requirements related to conditions of work that have been anticipated or previously requir ed and are accounted
for in the current environmental remediation liability .   The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Topock site may increase by as much as $ 289
million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Topock site
are expected to be recovered through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates.

Hinkley
Site

The Utility has been i mplementing interim remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and
control movement of the plume.  The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the r egulatory authority of the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region.  In November 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a
final clean-up and abatement order to contain and remediate the u nderground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts.  The final
order states that the Utility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action.  Additionally,
the final order requires setting plume capture requirements, requires establishing a monitoring and reporting program, and finalizes deadlines for the Utility to meet
interim cleanup targets.   The United States Geological Survey team is currently conducting a background study on the site to better define the chromium plume
boundaries.  The background study is expected to be finalized in 2019.  The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley site may increase by as
much as $ 145 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  T he costs associated with environmental remediation at
the Hinkley site will not be recovered through rates.

Former
Manufactured
Gas
Plants
(“MGPs
”)

Former m anufactured gas plants used coal and oil to produce gas for use by the Utility’s customers in the past .  The by-products and residues of this process were
often disposed at the manufactured gas plants themselves.  The Utility has undertaken a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing
process; many of the sites in the program have been addressed.  The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $
343 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The costs associated with environmental remediation at the MGP
sites are recovered through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates .

Utili
ty-Owned
Generation
Facilities
and
Third-Party
Disposal
Sites

Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are long-term projects that are undergoing a remediation process.  The Utility’s undiscounted
future costs associated with Util ity-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $ 145 million if the extent of
contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities
and third-party disposal sites are recovered through the HSM , where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates .

Fossil
Fuel-Fired
Generation
Sites

In 1998 the Utility divested its generation power plan t business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility has sold its fossil-fueled power plants, the
Utility has retained the environmental remediation liability associated with each site .  The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired
generation sites may increase by as much as $ 106 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The environmental
remediation costs associated w i th the fossil fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.

143

Nuclear
Insurance

The Utility is a member of NEIL, which is a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities.  NEIL provides insurance coverage for property damages and
business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired
Humboldt Bay Unit 3.  NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $ 3.2 billion per nuclear incident and $2.6 billion per non-
nuclear incident for Diablo Canyon .  Humboldt Bay Unit 3 has up to $ 131 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages.

NEIL also provide s coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants.  Certain acts of terrorism may be “certified” by the Secretary of the
Treasury.  If damages are caused by certified acts of terrorism, NEIL can obtain compensation from the federal government and will provide up to its full policy
limit of $ 3.2 billion for each insured loss.  In contrast, NEIL would treat all non-certif ied terrorist acts occurring within a 12-month period against one or more
commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL as one event and the owners of the affected plants would share the $ 3.2 billion policy limit amount.

In addition to the nuclear ins urance the Utility maintains through the   NEIL, the Utility also is a member of the   EMANI, which provides excess insurance
coverage for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon.

If NEIL losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.     If NEIL were to exercise this assessment,
as of December 31, 2017, the current maximum aggregate annual retrospect ive premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $ 57 million.
EMANI provides $200 million for any one accident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amount recoverable under the Utility’s NEIL policies.  If
EMANI losses in any po licy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $ 3 million, as of
December 31, 2017.

Under the Price-Anderson Act, public liability claims that arise from nuclear incid ents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation of
material to and from Diablo Canyon are limited to $ 13.5 billion.  The Utility purchased the maximum available public liability insurance of $ 450 million for
Diablo Canyon.  The balance of the $ 13.5 billion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclear reactors.  The
Utility may be assessed up to $ 255 million per nuclear incident under this program, with payments in each year limited to a m aximum of $38 million per
incident.  Both the maximum assessment and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.  The next scheduled adjustment is
due on or before September 10, 2018 .

The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to a
fuel fabricator or that occur at the fuel fabricator’s facility.  The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidents
up to a maximum of $ 450 million per incident.   In addition, the Utility has $ 53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a $ 500 million
indemnification from the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents, covering liabilities in excess of the lia bil ity insurance.

Various electricity suppliers filed claims in the Utility’s proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energy supplied to
the Utility’s customers bet ween May 2000 and June 2001.   While the FERC and judicial proceedings are pending, the Utility has pursued, and continues to
pursue, settlements with electricity suppliers.  The Utility has entered into a number of settlement agreements with various electr icity suppliers to resolve some of
these disputed claims and to resolve the Utility’s refund claims agains t these electricity suppliers.   Under these settlement agreements, a mounts payable by the
parties are, in some instances, subject to adjustment based on the outcome of the various refund offset and interest issues being considered by the FER C.
Generally, any net refunds, claim offsets, or other credits that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either through settlement or through the conclus ion of
the various FERC and judicial proceedings are refunded to customers through rates in future periods.

At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $ 243 million and $ 236 million in net claims within
Disputed claims and customer refunds.  The Utility is uncertain when or how the remaining net disputed claims liability will be resolved.

INTERNAL
CONTROL
OVER

FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Management of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.     PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GA AP.     Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of PG&E Corporati on and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial sta tements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.     Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Co mmission.     Based on its assessment and those criteria,

Prior Plan after December 31, 2013 and prior to the Effective Date.  After the Effective Date, no awards may be granted under the Prior Plan.  Shares of Stock
issued hereunder shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock or any combination thereof.  If (i) an outstanding Award for any reason
expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised or settled in full, or if shares of Stock acquired pursuant to an Award subject to forfeiture or

shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan; or (ii) after December 31, 2013, an outstanding award under the Prior Plan (whenever granted)
for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised or settled in full, or if shares of stock acquired pursuant to an award under the
Prior Plan subject to forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company, the shares of stock allocable to the terminated portion of such award or
such forfeited or repurchased shares or stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan (as of December 31, 2013 there were 6,194,819 shares of stock
subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plan).  Shares of Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the Plan (and shall again be available for
issuance under the Plan) with respect to any portion of an Award (or, after December 31, 2013, an award under the Prior Plan) that is settled in cash (other than in
the case of Options or SARs, in which case shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the cash delivered shall be deemed issued pursuant to the Plan).
Upon the exercise of an SAR (or, after December 31, 2013, exercise of an SAR that was granted under the Prior Plan), the gross number of shares for which the
SAR is exercised shall be deemed issued and shall not again be available for issuance under the Plan.  In the event that (i) any Option or other Award granted
hereunder is exercised through the tendering of shares of Stock (either actually or by attestation) or by the withholding of shares by the Company, or (ii)

withholding tax liabilities arising from such Award are satisfied by the tendering of shares of Stock (either actually or by attestation) or by the withholding of
shares by the Company, then in each such case (other than in the case of such shares tendered or withheld in connection with the exercise of Options or SARs) the
shares of Stock so tendered or withheld shall be added to the shares available for grant under the Plan on a one-for-one basis.  In the event that after December 31,
2013, (i) any option or award under the Prior Plan is exercised through the tendering of shares (either actually or by attestation) or by the withholding of shares by
the Company, or (ii) withholding tax liabilities arising from such options or awards are satisfied by the tendering of shares (either actually or by attestation) or by
the withholding of shares by the Company, then in each such case (other than in the case of such shares tendered or withheld in connection with the exercise of
Options or SARs) the shares so tendered or withheld shall be added to the shares available for grant under the Plan on a one-for-one basis.

Structure

  Subject to any required action by the shareholders of the Company, Section 409A of the

Code and Section 162(m) of the Code for Awards intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception thereunder, in the event of
any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar
change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the shareholders of the Company in a form other than
Stock (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the
number and kind of shares subject to the Plan and to any outstanding Awards, in the Award limits set forth in Section 5.4 , and in the exercise or purchase price per
share under any outstanding Award in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under the Plan.  For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of
any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company."  Any fractional share resulting from
an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.  The Committee in its sole discretion, may also make such
adjustments in the terms of any Award to reflect, or related to, such changes in the capital structure of the Company or distributions as it deems appropriate,
including modification of Performance Goals, Performance Award Formulas and Performance Periods, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code for Awards intended
to qualify as "performance-based compensation" thereunder.  The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be final, binding and
conclusive.

To the extent permitted under the rules of the applicable stock exchange on which the Stock is listed, Substitute
Awards shall not reduce the shares of Stock authorized for grant under the Plan, nor shall Shares subject to a Substitute Award be added to the shares of Stock
available for Awards under the Plan as provided above.  Additionally, subject to the rules of the applicable stock exchange on which the Stock is listed, in the event
that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary Corporation or with which the Company or any Subsidiary Corporation combines has shares available
under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to
the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such
acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be
used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares authorized for grant under the Plan (and shares subject to such Awards shall not be added to the
shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided in the paragraphs above); provided that Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date
awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who
were not Employees or Directors prior to such acquisition or combination.

Eligible.
  An Incentive Stock Option ("ISO") may be granted only to a person who, on the effective date of grant, is an

ISO-Qualifying
Corporation
"
).  Any person who is not an

Incentive Stock Option granted to a prospective Employee upon the condition that such person become an Employee of an ISO-Qualifying Corporation shall be
deemed granted effective on the date such person commences Service with an ISO-Qualifying Corporation, with an exercise price determined as of such date in
accordance with Section 6.1.

(b)

 Fair

Value
Limitation.
  To the extent that options designated as Incentive Stock Options (granted under all stock option
plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) become exercisable by a Participant for the first time during any calendar year for stock having a
Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount shall be treated as
Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they
were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted.  If the Code is amended to
provide for a limitation different from that set forth in this Section, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with
respect to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code.  If an Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory
Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section, the Participant may designate which portion of such Option the Participant is exercising.
In the absence of such designation, the Participant shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first.  Upon exercise, shares
issued pursuant to each such portion shall be separately identified.

"
), (iv) by delivery of a properly executed
notice of exercise electing a Net-Exercise, (v) by such other consideration as may be approved by the Committee from time to time to the extent permitted by

be deemed to have been exercised by the Participant on such day with payment made by withholding shares otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of
the Option.  In such event, the Company shall deliver to the Participant the number of shares for which the Option was deemed exercised, less the number of shares
required to be withheld for the payment of the total purchase price and required withholding taxes; provided, however, any fractional share shall be settled in cash.

of election certifies the results of the annual election of directors by shareholders of PG&E Corporation or (2) the date that this Plan becomes effective and grants
can be made consistent with legal requirements; provided, however, that in extraordinary circumstances, the grant shall be delayed until the first business day of
the next open trading window period following certification of the director election results, as determined by the General Counsel of PG&E Corporation (the

Grants made pursuant to this Section 7, but prior to January 1, 2015, shall be subject to the terms of Section 7 of the Prior Plan as in effect prior to the

Effective Date, provided, however, that such grants shall be deemed made under this Plan.

7.1

  Grant
of
Restricted
Stock
Unit.

(a)

 Timing and Amount of Grant.  Each person who is a Non-employee Director on the Grant Date (other than a Non-

employee Director who is serving as the Company's non-executive Chair of the Board) shall receive a grant of Restricted Stock Units with the number of
Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing $140,000 by the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Grant Date (rounded down to the nearest whole Restricted
Stock Unit).  Each Non-employee Director who also serves as the Company's non-executive Chair of the Board on the Grant Date shall receive a grant of
Restricted Stock Units with the number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing $220,000 by the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Grant Date
(rounded down to the nearest whole Restricted Stock Unit.) The Restricted Stock Units awarded to a Non-employee Director shall be credited to the director's
Restricted Stock Unit account.  Each Restricted Stock Unit awarded to a Non-employee Director in accordance with this Section 7.1(a) shall be deemed to be equal
to one (1) (or fraction thereof) share of Stock on the Grant Date, and the value of the Restricted Stock Unit shall thereafter fluctuate in value in accordance with the
Fair Market Value of the Stock.  No person shall receive more than one grant of Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Section 7.1(a) during any calendar year.

(b)

 Dividend
Rights
.  Each Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Unit account shall be credited quarterly on each
dividend payment date with additional shares of Restricted Stock Units (including fractions computed to three decimal places) determined by dividing (1) the
amount of cash dividends paid on such date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Stock Units previously credited to the
account by (2) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.  Such additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and
shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units originally subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award.

(c)

 Vesting
and
Settlement
of
Restricted
Stock
Units
.  Restricted Stock Units shall vest on the earlier of (i) the first

anniversary of the Grant Date or (ii) the last day of the director's elected term (the normal vesting date).  Restricted Stock Units credited to a Non-employee
Director's Restricted Stock Unit account shall, to the extent vested, be settled in a lump sum by the issuance of an equal number of shares of Stock, rounded down
to the nearest whole share, upon the earliest of (i) the first anniversary of the Grant Date (normal settlement date), (ii) the Non-employee Director's death, (iii) the
Non-employee Director's Disability (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), or (iv) the Non-employee Director's Separation from Service following a
Change in Control.  However, commencing with Restricted Stock Units having a Grant Date in 2015, a Non-employee Director may irrevocably elect, no later than
December 31 of the calendar year prior to the Grant Date of the Restricted Stock Units (or such later time permitted by Section 409A) to have the Non-employee
Director's Restricted Stock Unit account settled in (1) a series of 10 approximately equal annual installments (which shall be separate payments for purposes of
Section 409A) commencing in January of any year following the normal settlement date, or (2) a lump sum in January of any future year following the normal
settlement date.  In the event that the Non-employee Director elects settlement of the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence, the Restricted Stock Units shall be earlier settled in a lump sum, to the extent vested, upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in Section 7.1(c)
(ii) through 7.1(c)(iv) prior to the elected settlement date (or commencement thereof in the case of settlement in 10 equal annual installments).  In the event that a
Non-employee Director elects to have the Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Unit account settled in a series of 10 approximately equal annual installments
commencing in January of any year following the normal settlement date and one of the events set forth in Section 7.1(c)(ii) through 7.1(c)(iv) occurs after
commencement of such installments but prior to full settlement of the Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Units, then any remaining unsettled Restricted
Stock Units will be settled in a lump sum upon the occurrence of the applicable event but only to the extent that such acceleration would not result in the
imposition of taxation under Section 409A.  The Board may authorize other deferral alternatives with respect to Restricted Stock Units granted to Non-employee
Directors, provided that such deferral alternatives comply with the deferral timing and other requirements of Section 409A.  Such deferral alternatives may include,

without limitation, deferral until the Non-employee Director's separation from service or until the January following such separation.

Stock Units credited to the Participant's account that have not vested in accordance with Section 7.2(b) or 7.3 shall be forfeited to the Company and from and after
the date of such Separation from Service, and the Participant shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto; provided, however, that if the Non-employee
Director Separates from Service due to a pending Disability determination, such forfeiture shall not occur until a finding that such Disability has not occurred.

(b)

 Death
or
Disability
.  If the Non-employee Director becomes "disabled," within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code or in the

event of the Non-employee Director's death, all Restricted Stock Units credited to the Non-employee Director's account shall immediately vest and become
payable, in accordance with Section 7.1(c), to the Participant (or the Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the rights to the Restricted
Stock Units by reason of the Participant's death) in the form of a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to the Restricted
Stock Unit account, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

different terms and conditions pertaining to Non-employee Director Awards, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

reflect such Participant's individual performance in his or her position with the Company or such other factors as the Committee may determine.  With respect to a
Performance Award intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation to a Covered Employee, the Committee shall have the discretion to reduce
(but not increase) some or all of the value of the Performance Award that would otherwise be paid to the Covered Employee upon its settlement notwithstanding
the attainment of any Performance Goal and the resulting value of the Performance Award determined in accordance with the Performance Award Formula.

(c)

 Payment
in
Settlement
of
Performance
Awards.
  As soon as practicable following the Committee's determination and certification

in accordance with Sections 10.5(a) and (b) but, in any case, no later than the 15th day of the third month following completion of the Performance Period
applicable to a Performance Award (or such shorter period set forth in an Award Agreement), payment shall be made to each eligible Participant (or such
Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the right to receive such payment by reason of the Participant's death) of the final value of the
Participant's Performance Award.  Payment of such amount shall be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee.

10.6

  Voting
Rights,
Dividend
Equivalent
Rights
and
Distributions.
  Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock
represented by Performance Share Awards until the date of the issuance of such shares, if any (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company
or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any
Performance Share Award that the Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a
record date prior to the date on which the Performance Shares are settled or forfeited.  Such Dividend Equivalents, if any, shall be credited to the Participant in the
form of additional whole Performance Shares as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock.  The number of additional Performance Shares (rounded
to the nearest whole number) to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on such date with respect to the number of
shares of Stock represented by the Performance Shares previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.
Dividend Equivalents credited in connection with Performance Shares shall be subject to Section 5.5 of the Plan.  Settlement of Dividend Equivalents may be made
in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee, and may be paid on the same basis as settlement of the related Performance
Share as provided in Section 10.5.  Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid with respect to Performance Units.  In the event of an adjustment described in
Section 4.2, the adjusted Performance Share Award shall be immediately subject to the same Performance Goals as are applicable to the Award.

10.7

  Effect
of
Termination
of
Service.
  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the grant of a Performance Award and set forth in the

Award Agreement, the effect of a Participant's termination of Service on the Performance Award shall be as follows:

(a)

 Death
or
Disability.
  If the Participant's Service terminates because of the death or Disability of the Participant before the

completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, the final value of the Participant's Performance Award shall be determined by the
extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained with respect to the entire Performance Period and shall be prorated based on the number of

months of the Participant's Service during the Performance Period.  Payment shall be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted
by Section 10.5.

(b)

 Other
Termination
of
Service.
  If the Participant's Service terminates for any reason except death or Disability before the

completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, such Award shall be forfeited in its entirety; provided, however, that in the event of
termination of the Participant's Service for other reasons, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may waive the automatic forfeiture of all or any portion of any such
Award, to the extent consistent with the preservation of the tax deductibility of awards pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.

11.

 Terms
and
Conditions
of
Restricted
Stock
Unit
Awards
.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award,
in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish.  No Restricted Stock Unit Award or purported Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be a valid and
binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement.  Award Agreements evidencing Restricted Stock Units may
incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:

11.1

  Grant
of
Restricted
Stock
Unit
Awards.
  Restricted Stock Unit Awards may be granted upon such conditions as the Committee shall

determine, including, without limitation, upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals described in Section 10.4.  If either the grant of a Restricted Stock
Unit Award or the Vesting Conditions with respect to such Award is to be contingent upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals, the Committee shall
follow procedures substantially equivalent to those set forth in Sections 10.3 through 10.5(a) for Awards intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based
compensation" exception under Section 162(m).

11.2

  Vesting.
  Restricted Stock Units may or may not be made subject to Vesting Conditions based upon the satisfaction of such Service

requirements, conditions, restrictions or performance criteria, including, without limitation, Performance Goals as described in Section 10.4, as shall be established
by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award.

11.3

  Voting
Rights,
Dividend
Equivalent
Rights
and
Distributions.
  Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock

represented by Restricted Stock Units until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly
authorized transfer agent of the Company).  However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Restricted Stock Unit
Award that the Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a record date prior to
the date on which Restricted Stock Units held by such Participant are settled.  Such Dividend Equivalents, if any, shall be paid by crediting the Participant with
additional whole Restricted Stock Units as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock.  The number of additional Restricted Stock Units (rounded to
the nearest whole number) to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on such date with respect to the number of
shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Stock Units previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.  Such
additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time as the Restricted
Stock Units originally subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award, provided that Dividend Equivalents may be settled in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination
thereof as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.  In the event of an adjustment as described in Section 4.2, the Participant's adjusted
Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions as are applicable to the Award.

11.4

  Effect
of
Termination
of
Service.
  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award and set

forth in the Award Agreement, if a Participant's Service terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary (including the Participant's death or disability),
then the Participant shall forfeit to the Company any Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Award which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the
Participant's termination of Service.

11.5

  Settlement
of
Restricted
Stock
Unit
Awards
.
  The Company shall issue to a Participant on the date on which Restricted Stock Units

subject to the Participant's Restricted Stock Unit Award vest or on such other date determined by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award
Agreement one (1) share of Stock (and/or any other new, substituted or additional securities or other property pursuant to an adjustment described in Section 11.3)
for each Restricted Stock Unit then becoming vested or otherwise to be settled on such date, subject to the withholding of applicable taxes, provided that Restricted
Stock Units may be settled in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if permitted by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement and subject to the restrictions of Section 409A of the Code,
the Participant may elect in accordance with terms specified in the Award Agreement to defer receipt of all or any portion of the shares of Stock or other property
otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Section.

12.

 Deferred
Compensation
Awards
.

12.1

  Establishment
of
Deferred
Compensation
Award
Programs.
  This Section 12 shall not be effective unless and until the Committee

determines to establish a program pursuant to this Section.  The Committee, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, may establish
one or more programs pursuant to the Plan under which:

(a)

 Subject to the restrictions of Section 409A of the Code, Participants designated by the Committee who are Insiders or otherwise

among a select group of management or highly compensated Employees may irrevocably elect, prior to a date specified by the Committee, to reduce such
Participant's compensation otherwise payable in cash (subject to any minimum or maximum reductions imposed by the Committee) and to be granted
automatically at such time or times as specified by the Committee one or more Awards of Stock Units with respect to such numbers of shares of Stock as
determined in accordance with the rules of the program established by the Committee and having such other terms and conditions as established by the Committee.

(b)

 Subject to the restrictions of Section 409A of the Code, Participants designated by the Committee who are Insiders or

otherwise among a select group of management or highly compensated Employees may irrevocably elect, prior to a date specified by the Committee, to be granted
automatically an Award of Stock Units with respect to such number of shares of Stock and upon such other terms and conditions as established by the Committee
in lieu of cash or shares of Stock otherwise issuable to such Participant upon the settlement of a Performance Award or Performance Unit.

12.2

  Terms
and
Conditions
of
Deferred
Compensation
Awards.
  Deferred Compensation Awards granted pursuant to this Section 12 shall

be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish.  No such Deferred Compensation Award or purported
Deferred Compensation Award shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement.  Award
Agreements evidencing Deferred Compensation Awards may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to
the following terms and conditions:

(a)

 Vesting
Conditions
.  Deferred Compensation Awards shall or shall not be subject to vesting conditions, as determined by the

Committee.

(b)

 Terms
and
Conditions
of
Stock
Units
.

(i)

 Voting
Rights,
Dividend
Equivalent
Rights
and
Distributions.
  Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to
shares of Stock represented by Stock Units until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a
duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the applicable Award Agreement that the Participant
shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a record date prior to the date on which Stock
Units held by such Participant are settled.  Such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid by crediting the Participant with additional whole and/or fractional Stock Units
as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock.  The method of determining the number of additional Stock Units to be so credited shall be specified by
the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.  Such additional Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the
same manner and at the same time as the Stock Units originally subject to the Stock Unit Award.  In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock
or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.2, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the
Participant's Stock Unit Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other
than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award.

(ii)

 Settlement
of
Stock
Unit
Awards.
  A Participant electing to receive an Award of Stock Units pursuant to this

Section 12, shall specify at the time of such election a settlement date with respect to such Award in accordance with rules established by the Committee.  Except
as otherwise set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, the Company shall issue to the Participant upon the earlier of the settlement date elected by the
Participant or the date of the Participant's Separation from Service, a number of whole shares of Stock equal to the number of whole Stock Units subject to the
Stock Unit Award. The Participant shall not be required to pay any additional consideration (other than applicable tax withholding) to acquire such shares.  Any
fractional Stock Unit subject to the Stock Unit Award shall be settled by the Company by payment in cash of an amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the
payment date of such fractional share.

13.

 Other
Stock-Based
Awards
.

In addition to the Awards set forth in Sections 6 through 12 above, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may carry out the purpose of this Plan by
awarding Stock-Based Awards as it determines to be in the best interests of the Company and subject to such other terms and conditions as it deems necessary and
appropriate.  Such awards may be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee shall from time to time establish.

14.

 Change
in
Control
.

14.1

  Effect
of
Change
in
Control
.
  Except as set forth in an applicable Award Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control, the surviving,
continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror "
), may, without the consent of any
Participant, either assume or continue the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Awards or substitute for such Awards substantially equivalent
Awards covering the Acquiror's stock.  Except as set forth in an applicable Award Agreement, any such Awards which are neither assumed, continued, or
substituted by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised (if applicable) as of the Change in Control shall, contingent on the Change in
Control, become fully vested, and Options and SARs become exercisable immediately prior to the Change in Control.  Except as set forth in an applicable Award
Agreement, Awards which are assumed or continued in connection with a Change in Control shall be subject to such additional accelerated vesting and/or
exercisability, or lapse of restrictions in connection with the Participant's termination of Service in connection with the Change in Control as the Committee or
Board may determine, if any.

14.2

  Non-employee
Director
Awards
.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Non-employee Director Awards shall be subject to the terms of Section

7, and not this Section 14.

15.

 Compliance
with
Securities
Law
.

The grant of Awards and the issuance of shares of Stock pursuant to any Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements

of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities and the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be
listed.  In addition, no Award may be exercised or shares issued pursuant to an Award unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time
of such exercise or issuance be in effect with respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the Award or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares
issuable pursuant to the Award may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary
to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which
such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to issuance of any Stock, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any
qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with
respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

16.

 Tax
Withholding
.

16.1

  Tax
Withholding
in
General.
  The Company shall have the right to deduct from any and all payments made under the Plan, or to require

the Participant, through payroll withholding, cash payment or otherwise, including by means of a Cashless Exercise or Net Exercise of an Option, to make
adequate provision for, the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to an
Award or the shares acquired pursuant thereto.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock, to release shares of Stock from an escrow

established pursuant to an Award Agreement, or to make any payment in cash under the Plan unless the Participating Company Group's tax withholding
obligations have been satisfied by the Participant.

16.2

  Withholding
in
Shares.
  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable to a

Participant upon the exercise or settlement of an Award, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market
Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount
determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates to the extent required to avoid adverse accounting or other consequences to the Company or
Participant.

17.

 Amendment
or
Termination
of
Plan
.

The Board or the Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time.  However, without the approval of the Company's

shareholders, there shall be (a) no increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the
provisions of Section 4.2), (b) no change in the class of persons eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, (c) no amendment to Section 5.4(b) or 5.4(c), and (d)
no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the Company's shareholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, only the Board may amend Section 7 and may do so without the approval of the Company's shareholders.  No amendment, suspension or termination of
the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Award unless expressly provided by the Board or the Committee.  In any event, no amendment, suspension or
termination of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant unless necessary to comply with any applicable
law, regulation or rule.

18.

 Miscellaneous
Provisions
.

18.1

  Repurchase
Rights
.
  Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions
as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time the Award is granted.  The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it
may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company.  Upon request by the Company, each
Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the
Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such
transfer restrictions.

18.2

  Provision
of
Information.
  Each Participant shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information

generally made available to the Company's common shareholders.

18.3

  Rights
as
Employee,
Consultant
or
Director.
  No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, shall have a right to be selected as

a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant.  Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer on any
Participant a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or Director or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the
Participant's Service at any time.  To the extent that an Employee of a Participating Company other than the Company receives an Award under the Plan, that
Award shall in no event be understood or interpreted to mean that the Company is the Employee's employer or that the Employee has an employment relationship
with the Company.  A Participant's rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with any Award is derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to
permit the individual to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award.  By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant expressly
acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards.  Any Award granted hereunder is not
intended to be compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of a Participant's normal or expected compensation, and in no way represents any portion
of a Participant's salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other purpose.  The
Company and its Parent Corporations and Subsidiary Corporations and Affiliates reserve the right to terminate the Service of any person at any time, and for any
reason, subject to applicable laws and such person's written employee agreement (if any), and such terminated person shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived
any claim to damages or specific performance for breach of contract or dismissal, compensation for loss of office, tort or otherwise with respect to the Plan or any
outstanding Award that is forfeited and/or is terminated by its terms or to any future Award.

18.4

  Rights
as
a
Shareholder.
  A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the

date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  No
adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in
another provision of the Plan.

18.5

  Fractional
Shares.
  The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise or settlement of any Award.

18.6

  Severability
.  If any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or
any part thereof) of the Plan shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

18.7

  Beneficiary
Designation.
  Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a

beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant's death before he or she receives any or
all of such benefit.  Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective
only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime.  If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the
Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse.  If a Participant dies without an effective
designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant's legal
representative.

18.8

  Unfunded
Obligation.
  Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company.  Any amounts payable to

Participants pursuant to the Plan shall be unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.  No Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any

special accounts with respect to such obligations.  The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments,
which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder.  Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account
shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested
or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's creditors in any assets of any Participating Company.  The Participants shall have no claim against any
Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.  Each
Participating Company shall be responsible for making benefit payments pursuant to the Plan on behalf of its Participants or for reimbursing the Company for the
cost of such payments, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion.  In the event the respective Participating Company fails to make such payment or
reimbursement, a Participant's (or other individual's) sole recourse shall be against the respective Participating Company, and not against the Company.  A
Participant's acceptance of an Award pursuant to the Plan shall constitute agreement with this provision.

18.9

  Choice
of
Law.
  Except to the extent governed by applicable federal law, the validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the

Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law rules.

18.10

  Section
409A
of
the
Code.
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to the extent (i) any Award payable in connection with

a Participant's Separation from Service constitutes deferred compensation subject to (and not exempt from) Section 409A of the Code and (ii) the Participant is
deemed at the time of such separation to be a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder, then payment shall
not be made or commence until the earlier of (i) six (6)-months after such Separation from Service or (ii) the date of the Participant's death following such
Separation from Service; provided, however, that such delay shall only be effected to the extent required to avoid adverse tax treatment to the Participant, including
(without limitation) the additional twenty percent (20%) tax for which the Participant would otherwise be liable under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code in the
absence of such delay.  Upon the expiration of the applicable delay period, any payment which would have otherwise been paid during that period (whether in a
single sum or in installments) in the absence of this paragraph shall be paid to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary in one lump sum on the first business
day immediately following such delay and any undelayed payments will be paid in accordance with their normal terms.

18.11

  Restrictions
on
Transfer
.  No Award and no shares of Stock that have not been issued or as to which any applicable restriction,

performance or deferral period has not lapsed, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of decent and
distribution, and such Award may be exercised during the life of the Participant only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, an Award shall be
assignable or transferrable to a "family member" or other permitted transferee to the extent covered under Form S-8 Registration Statement under the Securities
Act.

by providing for Awards in the form of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock
Units, Deferred Compensation Awards and other Stock-Based Awards as described below.

Moreover, Incentive Stock Options shall not be granted later than February 19, 2024 (ten (10) years from the date on which the Plan was adopted by the Board).

(i)

withholding tax liabilities arising from such Award are satisfied by the tendering of shares of Stock (either actually or by attestation) or by the withholding of

Capital
Structure
.
  Subject to any required action by the shareholders of the Company, Section 409A of the

Code and Section 162(m) of the Code for Awards intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception thereunder, in the event of
any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar
change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the shareholders of the Company in a form other than
Stock (excepting normal cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the
number and kind of shares subject to the Plan and to any outstanding Awards, in the Award limits set forth in Section 5.4 , and in the exercise or purchase price per
share under any outstanding Award in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under the Plan.  For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of
any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company."  Any fractional share resulting from
an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.  The Committee in its sole discretion, may also make such
adjustments in the terms of any Award to reflect, or related to, such changes in the capital structure of the Company or distributions as it deems appropriate,
including modification of Performance Goals, Performance Award Formulas and Performance Periods, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code for Awards intended
to qualify as "performance-based compensation" thereunder.  The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be final, binding and
conclusive.

Awards shall not reduce the shares of Stock authorized for grant under the Plan, nor shall Shares subject to a Substitute Award be added to the shares of Stock
available for Awards under the Plan as provided above.  Additionally, subject to the rules of the applicable stock exchange on which the Stock is listed, in the event
that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary Corporation or with which the Company or any Subsidiary Corporation combines has shares available
under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to
the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such
acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be
used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares authorized for grant under the Plan (and shares subject to such Awards shall not be added to the
shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided in the paragraphs above); provided that Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date
awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who
were not Employees or Directors prior to such acquisition or combination.

plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) become exercisable by a Participant for the first time during any calendar year for stock having a
Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount shall be treated as
Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they
were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted.  If the Code is amended to
provide for a limitation different from that set forth in this Section, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with
respect to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code.  If an Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory
Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section, the Participant may designate which portion of such Option the Participant is exercising.
In the absence of such designation, the Participant shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first.  Upon exercise, shares

maximum number of shares of Stock that may be earned under the applicable Award(s).  During any calendar year no Participant may be granted Performance
Units or other Awards that are intended to comply with the performance-based exception under Code Section 162(m) and are denominated in cash under which

Participant during the first calendar year in which the Participant commences employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries.  If an Award is cancelled, the
cancelled Award shall continue to be counted toward the applicable limitation in this Section.

of election certifies the results of the annual election of directors by shareholders of PG&E Corporation or (2) the date that this Plan becomes effective and grants
can be made consistent with legal requirements; provided, however, that in extraordinary circumstances, the grant shall be delayed until the first business day of
the next open trading window period following certification of the director election results, as determined by the General Counsel of PG&E Corporation (the
"Grant Date").

Grants made pursuant to this Section 7, but prior to January 1, 2015, shall be subject to the terms of Section 7 of the Prior Plan as in effect prior to the

Effective Date, provided, however, that such grants shall be deemed made under this Plan.

7.1

  Grant
of
Restricted
Stock
Unit.

(a)

 Timing and Amount of Grant.  Each person who is a Non-employee Director on the Grant Date shall receive a grant of

Restricted Stock Units with the number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing $140,000 by the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Grant Date
(rounded down to the nearest whole Restricted Stock Unit).  The Restricted Stock Units awarded to a Non-employee Director shall be credited to the director's
Restricted Stock Unit account.  Each Restricted Stock Unit awarded to a Non-employee Director in accordance with this Section 7.1(a) shall be deemed to be equal
to one (1) (or fraction thereof) share of Stock on the Grant Date, and the value of the Restricted Stock Unit shall thereafter fluctuate in value in accordance with the
Fair Market Value of the Stock.  No person shall receive more than one grant of Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Section 7.1(a) during any calendar year.

(b)

 Dividend
Rights
.  Each Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Unit account shall be credited quarterly on each
dividend payment date with additional shares of Restricted Stock Units (including fractions computed to three decimal places) determined by dividing (1) the
amount of cash dividends paid on such date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Stock Units previously credited to the
account by (2) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.  Such additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and
shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units originally subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award.

(c)

 Vesting
and
Settlement
of
Restricted
Stock
Units
.  Restricted Stock Units shall vest on the earlier of (i) the first

anniversary of the Grant Date or (ii) the last day of the director's elected term (the normal vesting date).  Restricted Stock Units credited to a Non-employee
Director's Restricted Stock Unit account shall, to the extent vested, be settled in a lump sum by the issuance of an equal number of shares of Stock, rounded down
to the nearest whole share, upon the earliest of (i) the first anniversary of the Grant Date (normal settlement date), (ii) the Non-employee Director's death, (iii) the
Non-employee Director's Disability (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), or (iv) the Non-employee Director's Separation from Service following a
Change in Control.  However, commencing with Restricted Stock Units having a Grant Date in 2015, a Non-employee Director may irrevocably elect, no later than
December 31 of the calendar year prior to the Grant Date of the Restricted Stock Units (or such later time permitted by Section 409A) to have the Non-employee
Director's Restricted Stock Unit account settled in (1) a series of 10 approximately equal annual installments (which shall be separate payments for purposes of
Section 409A) commencing in January of any year following the normal settlement date, or (2) a lump sum in January of any future year following the normal
settlement date.  In the event that the Non-employee Director elects settlement of the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence, the Restricted Stock Units shall be earlier settled in a lump sum, to the extent vested, upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in Section 7.1(c)
(ii) through 7.1(c)(iv) prior to the elected settlement date (or commencement thereof in the case of settlement in 10 equal annual installments).  In the event that a
Non-employee Director elects to have the Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Unit account settled in a series of 10 approximately equal annual installments
commencing in January of any year following the normal settlement date and one of the events set forth in Section 7.1(c)(ii) through 7.1(c)(iv) occurs after
commencement of such installments but prior to full settlement of the Non-employee Director's Restricted Stock Units, then any remaining unsettled Restricted
Stock Units will be settled in a lump sum upon the occurrence of the applicable event but only to the extent that such acceleration would not result in the
imposition of taxation under Section 409A.  The Board may authorize other deferral alternatives with respect to Restricted Stock Units granted to Non-employee
Directors, provided that such deferral alternatives comply with the deferral timing and other requirements of Section 409A.  Such deferral alternatives may include,
without limitation, deferral until the Non-employee Director's separation from service or until the January following such separation.

Stock Units credited to the Participant's account that have not vested in accordance with Section 7.2(b) or 7.3 shall be forfeited to the Company and from and after
the date of such Separation from Service, and the Participant shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto; provided, however, that if the Non-employee
Director Separates from Service due to a pending Disability determination, such forfeiture shall not occur until a finding that such Disability has not occurred.

(b)

 Death
or
Disability
.  If the Non-employee Director becomes "disabled," within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code or in the

event of the Non-employee Director's death, all Restricted Stock Units credited to the Non-employee Director's account shall immediately vest and become
payable, in accordance with Section 7.1(c), to the Participant (or the Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the rights to the Restricted
Stock Units by reason of the Participant's death) in the form of a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units credited to the Restricted
Stock Unit account, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

value payable to the Participant in settlement of a Performance Award determined on the basis of the applicable Performance Award Formula will depend on the
extent to which Performance Goals established by the Committee are attained within the applicable Performance Period established by the Committee.

Committee shall establish the Performance Goal(s) and Performance Award Formula applicable to each Performance Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date
ninety (90) days after the commencement of the applicable Performance Period or (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and, in any
event, at a time when the outcome of the Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain.  Once established, the Performance Goals and Performance Award

Formula for Awards intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception under Section 162(m) shall not be changed during the
Performance Period, except as would result in the exercise of negative discretion by the Committee to reduce the amount of the Award otherwise payable as
permitted under Section 162(m).  The Company shall notify each Participant granted a Performance Award of the terms of such Award, including the Performance
Period, Performance Goal(s) and Performance Award Formula.

10.4

  Measurement

  Performance Measures shall be calculated with respect to the Company and/or each Subsidiary

Corporation and/or such division or other business unit as may be selected by the Committee, or may be based upon performance relative to performance of other
companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to performance of other companies.  Performance Measures may be based upon
one or more of the following objectively defined and non-discretionary business criteria and any other objectively verifiable and non-discretionary adjustments

Performance
Awards.

(a)

 Determination
of
Final
Value.
  As soon as practicable, but no later than the 15th day of the third month following the completion
of the Performance Period applicable to a Performance Award (or such shorter period set forth in an Award Agreement), the Committee shall certify in writing the
extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained and the resulting final value of the Award earned by the Participant and to be paid upon its
settlement in accordance with the applicable Performance Award Formula no later than the 15 th day of the third month following the completion of such
Performance Period (or such shorter period set forth in an Award Agreement).

(b)

 Discretionary
Adjustment
of
Award
Formula.

Award or at any time thereafter, provide for the positive or negative adjustment of the Performance Award Formula applicable to a Performance Award that is not
intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" to a "covered employee" within the meaning of Section 162(m) (a "
Covered
Employee
"
) to
reflect such Participant's individual performance in his or her position with the Company or such other factors as the Committee may determine.  With respect to a
Performance Award intended to constitute qualified performance-based compensation to a Covered Employee, the Committee shall have the discretion to reduce
(but not increase) some or all of the value of the Performance Award that would otherwise be paid to the Covered Employee upon its settlement notwithstanding
the attainment of any Performance Goal and the resulting value of the Performance Award determined in accordance with the Performance Award Formula.

(c)

 Payment
in
Settlement
of
Performance
Awards.
  As soon as practicable following the Committee's determination and certification

in accordance with Sections 10.5(a) and (b) but, in any case, no later than the 15th day of the third month following completion of the Performance Period
applicable to a Performance Award (or such shorter period set forth in an Award Agreement), payment shall be made to each eligible Participant (or such
Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the right to receive such payment by reason of the Participant's death) of the final value of the
Participant's Performance Award.  Payment of such amount shall be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee.

10.6

  Voting
Rights,
Dividend
Equivalent
Rights
and
Distributions.
  Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock
represented by Performance Share Awards until the date of the issuance of such shares, if any (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company
or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any
Performance Share Award that the Participant shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a
record date prior to the date on which the Performance Shares are settled or forfeited.  Such Dividend Equivalents, if any, shall be credited to the Participant in the
form of additional whole Performance Shares as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock.  The number of additional Performance Shares (rounded
to the nearest whole number) to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on such date with respect to the number of
shares of Stock represented by the Performance Shares previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.
Dividend Equivalents credited in connection with Performance Shares shall be subject to Section 5.5 of the Plan.  Settlement of Dividend Equivalents may be made
in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee, and may be paid on the same basis as settlement of the related Performance
Share as provided in Section 10.5.  Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid with respect to Performance Units.  In the event of an adjustment described in
Section 4.2, the adjusted Performance Share Award shall be immediately subject to the same Performance Goals as are applicable to the Award.

10.7

  Effect
of
Termination
of
Service.
  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the grant of a Performance Award and set forth in the

Award Agreement, the effect of a Participant's termination of Service on the Performance Award shall be as follows:

(a)

 Death
or
Disability.
  If the Participant's Service terminates because of the death or Disability of the Participant before the

completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, the final value of the Participant's Performance Award shall be determined by the
extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained with respect to the entire Performance Period and shall be prorated based on the number of
months of the Participant's Service during the Performance Period.  Payment shall be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted
by Section 10.5.

(b)

 Other
Termination
of
Service.
  If the Participant's Service terminates for any reason except death or Disability before the

completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, such Award shall be forfeited in its entirety; provided, however, that in the event of
termination of the Participant's Service for other reasons, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may waive the automatic forfeiture of all or any portion of any such
Award, to the extent consistent with the preservation of the tax deductibility of awards pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.

automatically at such time or times as specified by the Committee one or more Awards of Stock Units with respect to such numbers of shares of Stock as
determined in accordance with the rules of the program established by the Committee and having such other terms and conditions as established by the Committee.

(b)

shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock having a record date prior to the date on which Stock
Units held by such Participant are settled.  Such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid by crediting the Participant with additional whole and/or fractional Stock Units

the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.  Such additional Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the
same manner and at the same time as the Stock Units originally subject to the Stock Unit Award.  In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock
or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.2, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the
Participant's Stock Unit Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other
than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award.

(ii)

 Settlement
of
Stock

continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror "
), may, without the consent of any
Participant, either assume or continue the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Awards or substitute for such Awards substantially equivalent
Awards covering the Acquiror's stock.  Except as set forth in an applicable Award Agreement, any such Awards which are neither assumed, continued, or
substituted by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised (if applicable) as of the Change in Control shall, contingent on the Change in
Control, become fully vested, and Options and SARs become exercisable immediately prior to the Change in Control.  Except as set forth in an applicable Award

of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities and the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be
listed.  In addition, no Award may be exercised or shares issued pursuant to an Award unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time
of such exercise or issuance be in effect with respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the Award or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares
issuable pursuant to the Award may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary
to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which
such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to issuance of any Stock, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any
qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with
respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

adequate provision for, the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to an
Award or the shares acquired pursuant thereto.  The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock, to release shares of Stock from an escrow

foregoing, the Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount
determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates to the extent required to avoid adverse accounting or other consequences to the Company or
Participant.

17.

Plan

provisions of Section 4.2), (b) no change in the class of persons eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, (c) no amendment to Section 5.4(b) or 5.4(c), and (d)
no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the Company's shareholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule.  Notwithstanding the

the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Award unless expressly provided by the Board or the Committee.  In any event, no amendment, suspension or
termination of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant unless necessary to comply with any applicable
law, regulation or rule.

 Miscellaneous
Provisions

  Repurchase
Rights

  Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions
as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time the Award is granted.  The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it
may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company.  Upon request by the Company, each
Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the
Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such
transfer restrictions.

18.2

  Provision
of
Information.
  Each Participant shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information

generally made available to the Company's common shareholders.

18.3

  Rights
as
Employee,
Consultant
or
Director.
  No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, shall have a right to be selected as

a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant.  Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer on any
Participant a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or Director or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the
Participant's Service at any time.  To the extent that an Employee of a Participating Company other than the Company receives an Award under the Plan, that
Award shall in no event be understood or interpreted to mean that the Company is the Employee's employer or that the Employee has an employment relationship
with the Company.  A Participant's rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with any Award is derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to
permit the individual to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award.  By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant expressly
acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards.  Any Award granted hereunder is not
intended to be compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of a Participant's normal or expected compensation, and in no way represents any portion
of a Participant's salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other purpose.  The
Company and its Parent Corporations and Subsidiary Corporations and Affiliates reserve the right to terminate the Service of any person at any time, and for any
reason, subject to applicable laws and such person's written employee agreement (if any), and such terminated person shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived
any claim to damages or specific performance for breach of contract or dismissal, compensation for loss of office, tort or otherwise with respect to the Plan or any
outstanding Award that is forfeited and/or is terminated by its terms or to any future Award.

18.4

  Rights
as
a
Shareholder.
  A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the

date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  No
adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in
another provision of the Plan.

18.5

  Fractional
Shares.
  The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise or settlement of any Award.

18.6

  Severability
.  If any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or
any part thereof) of the Plan shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

18.7

  Beneficiary
Designation.
  Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a

beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant's death before he or she receives any or
all of such benefit.  Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective
only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime.  If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the
Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse.  If a Participant dies without an effective
designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant's legal
representative.

18.8

  Unfunded
Obligation.
  Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company.  Any amounts payable to

Participants pursuant to the Plan shall be unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title I of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.  No Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any
special accounts with respect to such obligations.  The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments,
which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder.  Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account
shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested
or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's creditors in any assets of any Participating Company.  The Participants shall have no claim against any

Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.  Each
Participating Company shall be responsible for making benefit payments pursuant to the Plan on behalf of its Participants or for reimbursing the Company for the
cost of such payments, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion.  In the event the respective Participating Company fails to make such payment or
reimbursement, a Participant's (or other individual's) sole recourse shall be against the respective Participating Company, and not against the Company.  A
Participant's acceptance of an Award pursuant to the Plan shall constitute agreement with this provision.

  Choice
of
Law.
  Except to the extent governed by applicable federal law, the validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the

Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law rules.

18.10

  Section
409A
of
the
Code.
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to the extent (i) any Award payable in connection with

a Participant's Separation from Service constitutes deferred compensation subject to (and not exempt from) Section 409A of the Code and (ii) the Participant is
deemed at the time of such separation to be a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder, then payment shall
not be made or commence until the earlier of (i) six (6)-months after such Separation from Service or (ii) the date of the Participant's death following such
Separation from Service; provided, however, that such delay shall only be effected to the extent required to avoid adverse tax treatment to the Participant, including
(without limitation) the additional twenty percent (20%) tax for which the Participant would otherwise be liable under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code in the
absence of such delay.  Upon the expiration of the applicable delay period, any payment which would have otherwise been paid during that period (whether in a
single sum or in installments) in the absence of this paragraph shall be paid to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary in one lump sum on the first business
day immediately following such delay and any undelayed payments will be paid in accordance with their normal terms.

18.11

  Restrictions
on
Transfer
.  No Award and no shares of Stock that have not been issued or as to which any applicable restriction,

performance or deferral period has not lapsed, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of decent and
distribution, and such Award may be exercised during the life of the Participant only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, an Award shall be
assignable or transferrable to a "family member" or other permitted transferee to the extent covered under Form S-8 Registration Statement under the Securities
Act.
