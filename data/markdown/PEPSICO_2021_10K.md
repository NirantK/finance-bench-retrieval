Forward-Looking Statements

This  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  contains  statements  reflecting  our  views  about  our  future  performance  that  constitute
“forward-looking  statements”  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995  (Reform  Act).
Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the
inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,”
“future,”  “goal,”  “guidance,”  “intend,”  “may,”  “objective,”  “outlook,”  “plan,”  “position,”  “potential,”  “project,”  “seek,”
“should,”  “strategy,”  “target,”  “will”  or  similar  statements  or  variations  of  such  words  and  other  similar  expressions.  All
statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or
anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking
statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They
inherently  involve  risks  and  uncertainties  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  predicted  in  any  such
forward-looking  statement.  These  risks  and  uncertainties  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  those  described  in  “Item  1A.  Risk
Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business
– Our Business Risks.” Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise. The discussion of risks in this report is by no means all-inclusive but is designed to
highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our future performance.

Item 1. Business.

PART I

Islands) Holding Corp. (Tingyi).

Our Distribution Network

Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks
and  are  also  sold  directly  to  consumers  through  e-commerce  platforms  and  retailers.  The  distribution  system  used  depends  on
customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.

4

Table of Contents

Direct-Store-Delivery

We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to
retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise
with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store
promotion and merchandising.

Customer Warehouse

Some  of  our  products  are  delivered  from  our  manufacturing  plants  and  distribution  centers,  both  company  and  third-party
operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,
and have lower turnover.

Distributor Networks

We  distribute  many  of  our  products  through  third-party  distributors.  Third-party  distributors  are  particularly  effective  when
greater  distribution  reach  can  be  achieved  by  including  a  wide  range  of  products  on  the  delivery  vehicles.  For  example,  our
foodservice  and  vending  business  distributes  beverages  and  convenient  foods  to  restaurants,  businesses,  schools  and  stadiums
through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.

E-commerce

Our  products  are  also  available  and  sold  directly  to  consumers  on  a  growing  number  of  company-owned  and  third-party  e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.

Ingredients and Other Supplies

The principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other
juice  concentrates,  aspartame,  corn,  corn  sweeteners,  flavorings,  flour,  grapefruit,  oranges  and  other  fruits,  oats,  potatoes,  raw
milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our
products.  Our  key  packaging  materials  include  plastic  resins,  including  polyethylene  terephthalate  (PET)  and  polypropylene
resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and
paperboard  cartons.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  integrate  recyclability  into  our  product  development  process  and  support  the
increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important
commodities  for  our  businesses  due  to  their  use  in  our  and  our  business  partners’  facilities  and  the  vehicles  delivering  our
products.  We  employ  specialists  to  secure  adequate  supplies  of  many  of  these  items  and  have  not  experienced  any  significant
continuous  shortages  that  would  prevent  us  from  meeting  our  requirements.  Many  of  these  ingredients,  raw  materials  and
commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this
risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps
and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and
suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make
investments  to  improve  the  sustainability  and  resources  of  our  agricultural  supply  chain,  including  the  development  of  our
initiative  to  advance  sustainable  farming  practices  by  our  suppliers  and  expanding  it  further  globally.  During  2021,  we
experienced higher than anticipated commodity, packaging and other input costs and, in some instances, limited shortages due to
global  inflation,  supply  chain  disruptions,  labor  shortages,  increased  demand  and  other  regulatory  and  macroeconomic  factors
associated  with  the  novel  coronavirus  (COVID-19)  pandemic,  which  has  continued  into  fiscal  2022.  See  Note  9  to  our
consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.

Table of Contents

We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to
which  our  suppliers,  at  their  sole  discretion,  may  elect  to  sell  their  accounts  receivable  with  PepsiCo  to  such  global  financial
institutions. These agreements did not have a material impact on our business or financial results. See “Our Financial Results –
Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” for further information.

Our Brands and Intellectual Property Rights

We  own  numerous  valuable  trademarks  which  are  essential  to  our  worldwide  businesses,  including  Agusha,  Amp  Energy,

licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Ocean Spray. We also distribute
Bang Energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes.
Joint  ventures  in  which  we  have  an  ownership  interest  either  own  or  have  the  right  to  use  certain  trademarks,  such  as  Lipton,
Sabra and Starbucks. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI
Partners while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America
and Europe. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format
and  foodservice  customers  with  chilled  direct-store-delivery.  See  Note  13  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further
information. In 2022, we will also begin to distribute Hard MTN Dew, an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the
Boston  Beer  Company.  We  have  licensed  the  use  of  the  Hard  MTN  Dew  trademark  to  the  Boston  Beer  Company,  which  has
appointed  us  as  their  distributor  for  this  product.  Trademarks  remain  valid  so  long  as  they  are  used  properly  for  identification
purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many
of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license
the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.

We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes
for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed
to others.

Seasonality

Our  businesses  are  affected  by  seasonal  variations.  Our  beverage  and  convenient  food  sales  are  generally  highest  in  the  third
quarter  due  to  seasonal  and  holiday-related  patterns  and  generally  lowest  in  the  first  quarter.  However,  taken  as  a  whole,
seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.

Our Customers

Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores,
discount/dollar  stores,  mass  merchandisers,  membership  stores,  hard  discounters,  e-commerce  retailers  and  authorized
independent  bottlers,  among  others.  We  normally  grant  our  independent  bottlers  exclusive  contracts  to  sell  and  manufacture
certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right
to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process
required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing
our trademarks for specified geographic areas.

We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the
consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees,
promotions  and  displays.  For  our  independent  bottlers,  these  incentives  are  referred  to  as  bottler  funding  and  are  negotiated
annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support,
new  product  support,  and  vending  and  cooler  equipment  placement.  Consumer  incentives  include  pricing  discounts  and
promotions,  and  other  promotional  offers.  Advertising  support  is  directed  at  advertising  programs  and  supporting  independent
bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as
point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs
support  the  acquisition  and  placement  of  vending  machines  and  cooler  equipment.  The  nature  and  type  of  programs  vary
annually.

Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-
commerce  websites  and  mobile  commerce  applications,  including  through  subscription  services  and  other  direct-to-consumer
businesses,  the  integration  of  physical  and  digital  operations  among  retailers,  as  well  as  the  international  expansion  of  hard
discounters,  and  the  current  economic  environment,  including  in  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  continue  to  increase  the
importance  of  major  customers.  In  2021,  sales  to  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  its  affiliates,  including  Sam’s  Club  (Sam’s),
represented  approximately  13%  of  our  consolidated  net  revenue,  with  sales  reported  across  all  of  our  divisions,  including
concentrate  sales  to  our  independent  bottlers,  which  were  used  in  finished  goods  sold  by  them  to  Walmart.  The  loss  of  this
customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.

Our Competition

Our beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of
international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and
private  label  manufacturers  and  economy  brands  and  other  competitors,  including  smaller  companies  developing  and  selling
micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In
many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage
competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra
Brands,  Inc.,  Hormel  Foods  Corporation,  Kellogg  Company,  Keurig  Dr  Pepper  Inc.,  The  Kraft  Heinz  Company,  Link  Snacks,
Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.

Many of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States
and  worldwide.  In  2021,  we  and  The  Coca-Cola  Company  represented  approximately  22%  and  19%,  respectively,  of  the  U.S.
liquid refreshment beverage  category  by  estimated  retail  sales  in  measured  channels, according to Information Resources, Inc.
However, The Coca-Cola

Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.

Our beverage and convenient food products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value,
quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging,
convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased
consumer focus on health and wellness and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of
distributing and purchasing  products.  Success  in  this  competitive  environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing
products,  effective  introduction  of  new  products  and  reformulations  of  existing  products,  increased  efficiency  in  production
techniques,  effective  incorporation  of  technology  and  digital  tools  across  all  areas  of  our  business,  the  effectiveness  of  our
advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand
and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with
the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.

Research and Development

We  engage  in  a  variety  of  research  and  development  activities  and  invest  in  innovation  globally  with  the  goal  of  meeting  the
needs  of  our  customers  and  consumers  and  accelerating  growth.  These  activities  principally  involve:  innovations  focused  on
creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients,
flavors  and  substrates;  development  and  improvement  of  our  manufacturing  processes  including  reductions  in  cost  and
environmental  footprint;  implementing  product  improvements  to  our  global  portfolio  that  reduce  added  sugars,  sodium  or
saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including whole grains, fruit, vegetables,
dairy,  protein,  fiber,  micronutrients  and  hydration;  development  of  packaging  technology  and  new  package  designs,  including
reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or otherwise sustainable
packaging;  development  of  marketing,  merchandising  and  dispensing  equipment;  further  expanding  our  beyond  the  bottle
portfolio  including  innovation  for  our  SodaStream  business;  investments  in  technology  and  digitalization,  including  artificial
intelligence  and  data  analytics  to  enhance  our  consumer  insights  and  research;  continuing  to  strengthen  our  omnichannel
capabilities,  particularly  in  e-commerce;  and  efforts  focused  on  reducing  our  impact  on  the  environment,  including  reducing
water use in our operations and our agricultural practices and reducing our climate impact in our operations throughout our value
chain.

Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the
United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States,  and  leverage  consumer  insights,  food  science  and  engineering  to  meet  our  strategy  to
continually innovate our portfolio of beverages and convenient foods.

Regulatory Matters

The  conduct  of  our  businesses,  including  the  production,  storage,  distribution,  sale,  display,  advertising,  marketing,  labeling,
content,  quality,  safety,  transportation,  packaging,  disposal,  recycling  and  use  of  our  products,  as  well  as  our  employment  and
occupational  health  and  safety  practices  and  protection  of  personal  information,  are  subject  to  various  laws  and  regulations
administered  by  federal,  state  and  local  governmental  agencies  in  the  United  States,  as  well  as  to  laws  and  regulations
administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are
made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our
businesses.

Table of Contents

The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include, but are not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
various  state  laws  governing  food  safety;  the  Food  Safety  Modernization  Act;  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Act  and
various  state  laws  and  regulations  governing  workplace  health  and  safety;  various  federal,  state  and  local  environmental
protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act;
various  federal  and  state  laws  and  regulations  governing  competition  and  trade  practices;  various  federal  and  state  laws  and
regulations  governing  our  employment  practices,  including  those  related  to  equal  employment  opportunity,  such  as  the  Equal
Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair
Labor  Standards  Act;  various  state  and  federal  laws  pertaining  to  sale  and  distribution  of  alcohol  beverages;  data  privacy  and
personal  data  protection  laws  and  regulations,  including  the  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act  of  2018  (as  modified  by  the
California Privacy Rights Act); customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of
our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws
regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment
of  taxes.  We  are  also  required  to  comply  with  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  the  Trade  Sanctions  Reform  and  Export
Enhancement  Act.  We  are  also  subject  to  various  state  and  local  statutes  and  regulations,  including  state  consumer  protection
laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance
listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the
product is below a safe harbor level.

We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws
and  regulations  governing  food  safety,  international  trade  and  tariffs,  supply  chain,  including  the  U.K.  Modern  Slavery  Act,
occupational  health  and  safety,  competition,  anti-corruption  and  data  privacy,  including  the  European  Union  General  Data
Protection  Regulation.  In  many  jurisdictions,  compliance  with  competition  laws  is  of  special  importance  to  us  due  to  our
competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely
on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses
in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture,
distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in
the  production  of  our  products.  These  taxes  vary  in  scope  and  form:  some  apply  to  all  beverages,  including  non-caloric
beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single
tax  rate  per  ounce/liter  on  beverages  containing  over  a  certain  level  of  added  sugar  (or  other  sweetener)  while  others  apply  a
graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate
on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or
other  limitations  on  the  marketing  or  sale  of  certain  of  our  products  as  a  result  of  ingredients  or  substances  contained  in  such
products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived
concerns  about  a  product,  warn  consumers  to  avoid  consumption  of  certain  ingredients  or  substances  present  in  our  products,
restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available.
It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates
or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from

9

Table of Contents

deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and
even  bans  on  the  use  of  some  types  of  single-use  plastics.  It  is  possible  that  similar  or  more  restrictive  requirements  may  be
proposed or enacted in the future.

We  are  also  subject  to  national  and  local  environmental  laws  in  the  United  States  and  in  foreign  countries  in  which  we  do
business,  including  laws  related  to  water  consumption  and  treatment,  wastewater  discharge  and  air  emissions.  In  the  United
States,  our  facilities  must  comply  with  the  Clean  Air  Act,  the  Clean  Water  Act,  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,
Compensation  and  Liability  Act,  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act  and  other  federal  and  state  laws  regarding
handling,  storage,  release  and  disposal  of  wastes  generated  onsite  and  sent  to  third-party  owned  and  operated  offsite  licensed
facilities  and  our  facilities  outside  the  United  States  must  comply  with  similar  laws  and  regulations.  In  addition,  continuing
concern over environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or
increased  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  (in  or  outside  of  the  United  States)  to  reduce  or  mitigate  the  potential  effects  of
greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or to expand
mandatory  reporting  of  certain  environmental,  social  and  governance  metrics.  Our  policy  is  to  abide  by  all  applicable
environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  we  have  internal  programs  in  place  with  respect  to  our  global  environmental
compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental
laws  and  regulations  and  to  achieve  our  sustainability  goals.  While  these  expenditures  have  not  had  a  material  impact  on  our
business,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations  to  date,  changes  in  environmental  compliance  requirements,  and
expenditures  necessary  to  comply  with  such  requirements  or  to  achieve  our  sustainability  goals,  could  adversely  affect  our
financial  performance.  In  addition,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  environmental  remediation  obligations  arising  in  the
normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical
activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental
remediation  and  indemnification  obligations  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty,  such  obligations  have  not  had,  and  are  not
expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Human Capital

PepsiCo  believes  that  human  capital  management,  including  attracting,  developing  and  retaining  a  high  quality  workforce,  is
critical  to  our  long-term  success.  Our  Board  of  Directors  (Board)  and  its  Committees  provide  oversight  on  a  broad  range  of
human  capital  management  topics,  including  corporate  culture,  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion,  pay  equity,  health  and  safety,
training and development and compensation and benefits.

We  employed  approximately  309,000  people  worldwide  as  of  December  25,  2021,  including  approximately  129,000  people
within  the  United  States.  We  are  party  to  numerous  collective  bargaining  agreements  and  believe  that  relations  with  our
employees are generally good.

Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our associates around the world is PepsiCo’s top priority. We strive to achieve an
injury-free  work  environment.  We  also  continue  to  invest  in  emerging  technologies  to  protect  our  employees  from  injuries,
including  leveraging  fleet  telematics  and  distracted  driving  technology,  resulting  in  reductions  in  road  traffic  accidents,  and
deploying  wearable  ergonomic  risk  reduction  devices.  In  addition,  throughout  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  have  remained
focused on the health and safety of our associates, especially our frontline associates who continue to make, move and sell our
products  during  this  critical  time,  including  by  continuing  to  implement  various  safety  protocols  in  our  facilities,  providing
personal protective equipment and enabling testing.

We  believe  that  our  culture  of  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  is  a  competitive  advantage  that  fuels  innovation,  enhances  our
ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation. We continually strive to improve the attraction, retention, and
advancement of diverse associates to ensure we sustain a high-caliber pipeline of talent that also represents the communities we
serve.  As  of  December  25,  2021,  our  global  workforce  was  approximately  27%  female,  while  management  roles  were
approximately  43%  female.  As  of  December  25,  2021,  approximately  45%  of  our  U.S.  workforce  was  comprised  of
racially/ethnically  diverse  individuals,  of  which  approximately  31%  of  our  U.S.  associates  in  managerial  roles  were
racially/ethnically  diverse  individuals.  Direct  reports  of  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  include  7  executives  globally  who  are
racially/ethnically diverse and/or female.

We are also committed to the continued growth and development of our associates. PepsiCo supports and develops its associates
through a variety of global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees' leadership and professional
skills, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, such as PEP U Degreed, our
internal global online learning resource. In 2021, PepsiCo employees completed over 1,000,000 hours of training.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect
on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the
only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that
may become material in the future.

Business Risks

The impact of COVID-19 continues to create considerable uncertainty for our business.

Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous measures have been
implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus and these measures have impacted and continue to impact
us, our business partners and consumers.

11

Table of Contents

We  have  seen  and  could  continue  to  see  changes  in  consumer  demand  as  a  result  of  COVID-19,  including  the  inability  of
consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship. We also
have  seen  and  could  continue  to  see  shifts  in  product  and  channel  preferences,  including  an  increase  in  demand  in  the  e-
commerce  channel,  which  has  impacted  and  could  continue  to  impact  our  sales  and  profitability.  Reduced  demand  for  our
products  or  changes  in  consumer  purchasing  patterns,  as  well  as  continued  economic  uncertainty,  can  adversely  affect  our
customers’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products. In addition, we
may also continue to experience business disruptions as a result of COVID-19, resulting from temporary closures of our facilities
or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work
because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions. In addition, we and
our  business  partners  may  also  continue  to  see  adverse  impacts  to  our  supply  chain  as  a  result  of  COVID-19  through  raw
material, packaging or other supply shortages, labor shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port
congestion and closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our business. Any sustained interruption in our or our
business  partners’  operations,  distribution  network  or  supply  chain  or  any  significant  continuous  shortage  of  raw  materials,
packaging or other supplies can negatively impact our business. We have also incurred, and could continue to incur, increased
employee and operating costs as a result of COVID-19, such as costs related to expanded benefits and frontline incentives, the
provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment reserves and
inventory write-offs, and cost inflation in commodities, packaging, transportation and other input costs, which have negatively
impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working
remotely  has  resulted  in  increased  demand  on  our  information  technology  infrastructure,  which  can  be  subject  to  failure,
disruption  or  unavailability,  and  increased  vulnerability  to  cyberattacks  and  other  cyber  incidents.  Also,  continued  economic
uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can
impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.

The impact of COVID-19 has heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the other risks discussed below. The extent of
the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  business  remains  uncertain  and  will  continue  to  depend  on  numerous  evolving
factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope
of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  and  spread  of  new  variants  of  the  virus,  including  the  omicron  and  delta  variants,  the
development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of
vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic,
governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer
behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary.

Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business.

Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer
trends  and  preferences,  including  the  types  of  products  our  consumers  want  and  how  they  browse  for,  purchase  and  consume
them.  Consumer  preferences  continuously  evolve  due  to  a  variety  of  factors,  including:  changes  in  consumer  demographics,
consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels);
pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other
plastic  packaging);  and  concerns  or  perceptions  regarding  the  nutrition  profile  and  health  effects  of,  or  location  of  origin  of,
ingredients  or  substances  in  our  products  or  packaging,  including  due  to  the  results  of  third-party  studies  (whether  or  not
scientifically  valid).  Concerns  with  any  of  the  foregoing  could  lead  consumers  to  reduce  or  publicly  boycott  the  purchase  or
consumption of our products. Consumer

12

Table of Contents

preferences  are  also  influenced  by  perception  of  our  brand  image  or  the  brand  images  of  our  products,  the  success  of  our
advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the
use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use, and the use of social media. These and other factors have reduced in
the past and could continue to reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase certain of our products. Any inability on our part to
anticipate  or  react  to  changes  in  consumer  preferences  and  trends,  or  make  the  right  strategic  investments  to  do  so,  including
investments  in  data  analytics  to  understand  consumer  trends,  can  lead  to  reduced  demand  for  our  products,  lead  to  inventory
write-offs  or  erode  our  competitive  and  financial  position,  thereby  adversely  affecting  our  business.  In  addition,  our  business
operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control that could
negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively
resolve these issues.

Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.

Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been,
and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to
maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child
labor  laws,  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion,  workplace  conditions  and  employee  health  and  safety;  any  failure  to  achieve  our
environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and
inclusion initiatives, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health concerns about our
products, products we distribute, or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our
products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or
safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of
our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and
social issues or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social
media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the
future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.

Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.

We have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling,
misbranding,  spoilage,  undeclared  allergens,  adulteration  or  contamination.  Product  recalls  have  in  the  past  and  could  in  the
future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due
to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure
to  comply  with  food  safety  laws  or  otherwise,  have  in  the  past  and  could  in  the  future  also  reduce  consumer  confidence  and
demand  for  our  products,  cause  production  and  delivery  disruptions,  and  result  in  increased  costs  (including  payment  of  fines
and/or judgments) and damage our reputation, particularly as we expand into new categories, such as nuts and meat convenient
foods globally and the distribution of alcoholic beverages in the United States, all of which can adversely affect our business.
Failure  to  maintain  adequate  oversight  over  product  quality  or  safety  can  result  in  product  recalls,  litigation,  government
investigations  or  inquiries  or  civil  or  criminal  proceedings,  all  of  which  may  result  in  fines,  penalties,  damages  or  criminal
liability.  Our  business  can  also  be  adversely  affected  if  consumers  lose  confidence  in  product  quality,  safety  and  integrity
generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.

Any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business.

Our products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple
geographies,  as  well  as  regional,  local  and  private  label  and  economy  brand  manufacturers  and  other  competitors,  including
smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers
focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-
Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty,
taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging,
convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can
be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market
new  products,  if  we  are  unable  to  effectively  adopt  new  technologies,  including  artificial  intelligence  and  data  analytics  to
develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our
capabilities  in  digital  marketing,  if  our  competitors  spend  more  aggressively  than  we  do  or  if  we  are  otherwise  unable  to
effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete
effectively, and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or
other expenditures.

Failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce can have an adverse effect on our business.

Our  business  requires  that  we  attract,  develop  and  maintain  a  highly  skilled  and  diverse  workforce.  Our  employees  are  highly
sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to
attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover, sustained
labor  shortage  or  unsuccessful  implementation  of  our  succession  plans  to  backfill  current  leadership  positions,  including  the
Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key
capabilities  such  as  e-commerce  and  digital  marketing  and  data  analytic  skills,  can  deplete  our  institutional  knowledge  base,
erode  our  competitive  advantage  or  result  in  increased  costs  due  to  increased  competition  for  employees,  higher  employee
turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented
communities can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.

Water scarcity can adversely affect our business.

We  and  our  business  partners  use  water  in  the  manufacturing  and  sourcing  of  our  products.  Water  is  also  essential  to  the
production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process. Lack of available water of acceptable quality, increasing
focus  by  governmental  and  non-governmental  organizations,  investors,  customers  and  consumers  on  water  scarcity  and
increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change,
may  lead  to:  supply  chain  disruption;  adverse  effects  on  our  operations  or  the  operations  of  our  business  partners;  higher
compliance  costs;  capital  expenditures  (including  investments  in  the  development  of  technologies  to  enhance  water  efficiency
and  reduce  consumption);  higher  production  costs,  including  less  favorable  pricing  for  water;  the  interruption  or  cessation  of
operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our goals relating to water
use;  perception  of  our  failure  to  act  responsibly  with  respect  to  water  use  or  to  effectively  respond  to  legal  or  regulatory
requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business.

Changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business.

The retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business
will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard
discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom
are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard
discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly
better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business can
be  adversely  affected  if  we  are  unable  to  profitably  expand  our  own  direct-to-consumer  e-commerce  capabilities.  The  retail
industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe
and  Latin  America,  resulting  in  large  retailers  or  buying  groups  with  increased  purchasing  power,  impacting  our  ability  to
compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively, resulting in an
inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must maintain mutually
beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Walmart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant
dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers,
even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely
affect our business.

Disruption  of  our  manufacturing  operations  or  supply  chain,  including  increased  commodity,  packaging,  transportation,
labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.

We have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Many of the
raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political
instability  or  unfavorable  economic  conditions.  Some  raw  materials  and  supplies,  including  packaging  materials,  are  available
only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There
can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  maintain  favorable  arrangements  and  relationships  with  suppliers  or  that  our
contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials
and  other  supplies  that  we  use  in  the  manufacture,  production  and  distribution  of  our  products.  Any  sustained  or  significant
disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which
can adversely impact our business.

The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled PET,
transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products
are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand,
supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters,
disease  or  pests  (including  the  impact  of  greening  disease  on  the  citrus  industry),  agricultural  uncertainty,  health  epidemics  or
pandemics  or  other  contagious  outbreaks  (including  COVID-19),  labor  shortages  (including  the  lack  of  availability  of  truck
drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export
restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity
constraints,  cybersecurity  incidents  or  other  disruptions,  loss  or  impairment  of  key  manufacturing  sites,  political  uncertainties,
acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in
the  open  market  and  the  prices  we  pay  for  such  items  are  subject  to  fluctuation.  We  experienced  higher  than  anticipated
commodity, packaging and transportation costs during 2021, which may continue. When input prices increase unexpectedly or
significantly, we may

15

Table of Contents

be  unwilling  or  unable  to  increase  our  product  prices  or  unable  to  effectively  hedge  against  price  increases  to  offset  these
increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.

Political and social conditions can adversely affect our business.

Political  and  social  conditions  in  the  markets  in  which  our  products  are  sold  have  been  and  could  continue  to  be  difficult  to
predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including
government  shutdowns  or  hostilities  between  countries)  in  these  markets  have  in  the  past  and  could  continue  to  impact  how
existing  laws,  regulations  and  government  programs  or  policies  are  implemented  or  result  in  uncertainty  as  to  how  such  laws,
regulations,  programs  or  policies  may  change,  including  with  respect  to  tariffs,  sanctions,  environmental  and  climate  change
regulations,  taxes,  benefit  programs,  the  movement  of  goods,  services  and  people  between  countries,  relationships  between
countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and
could  continue  to  result  in  exchange  rate  fluctuation,  volatility  in  global  stock  markets  and  global  economic  uncertainty  or
adversely  affect  demand  for  our  products,  any  of  which  can  adversely  affect  our  business.  In  addition,  political  and  social
conditions  in  certain  cities  throughout  the  U.S.  as  well  as  globally  have  resulted  in  demonstrations  and  protests,  including  in
connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations, including the distribution of our products and the
ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged
period  of  time,  including  due  to  actions  taken  by  governmental  authorities  in  affected  cities  and  regions,  which  can  adversely
affect our business.

Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets.

Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, Russia,
the  Middle  East,  China,  South  Africa,  Brazil  and  India.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  products  will  be  accepted  or  be
successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences,
method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by
economic,  political  and  social  conditions;  acts  of  war,  terrorist  acts,  and  civil  unrest,  including  demonstrations  and  protests;
competition; tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership
restrictions;  nationalization  of  our  assets  or  the  assets  of  our  business  partners;  government-mandated  closure,  or  threatened
closure,  of  our  operations  or  the  operations  of  our  business  partners;  restrictions  on  the  import  or  export  of  our  products  or
ingredients  or  substances  used  in  our  products;  highly  inflationary  economies;  devaluation  or  fluctuation  or  demonetization  of
currency;  regulations  on  the  transfer  of  funds  to  and  from  foreign  countries,  currency  controls  or  other  currency  exchange
restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability
to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack
of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S.
laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act
and  the  Trade  Sanctions  Reform  and  Export  Enhancement  Act;  and  adverse  consequences,  such  as  the  assessment  of  fines  or
penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand
our  business  in  developing  and  emerging  markets,  effectively  operate,  or  manage  the  risks  associated  with  operating,  in  these
markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets.

Changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business.

Many  of  the  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  are  sold  have  experienced  and  could  continue  to  experience  uncertain  or
unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns,

16

Table of Contents

which have and could continue to result in adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; inflation; volatile commodity
markets;  labor  shortages;  highly  inflationary  economies,  devaluation,  fluctuation  or  demonetization  of  currency;  contraction  in
the availability of credit; austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of
the  countries  in  which  our  products  are  sold;  or  a  decrease  in  the  fair  value  of  pension  or  post-retirement  assets  that  could
increase  future  employee  benefit  costs  and/or  funding  requirements  of  our  pension  or  post-retirement  plans.  In  addition,  we
cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with
whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business.

Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business.

We  depend  on  information  systems  and  technology,  including  public  websites  and  cloud-based  services,  for  many  activities
important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers; ordering
and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information, including personal data we
collect;  maintaining  accurate  financial  records  and  complying  with  regulatory,  financial  reporting,  legal  and  tax  requirements.
Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance,
systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents,
network  or  power  outages,  software,  equipment  or  telecommunications  failures,  the  unintentional  or  malicious  actions  of
employees  or  contractors,  natural  disasters,  fires  or  other  catastrophic  events.  Cyberattacks  and  other  cyber  incidents  are
occurring  more  frequently,  the  techniques  used  to  gain  access  to  information  technology  systems  and  data,  disable  or  degrade
service  or  sabotage  systems  are  constantly  evolving  and  becoming  more  sophisticated  in  nature  and  are  being  carried  out  by
groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for
periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or
malware  (such  as  ransomware),  exploiting  vulnerabilities  in  hardware,  software  or  other  infrastructure,  hacking,  website
defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and
business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents,
including the types of attacks and incidents described above. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary
to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately
respond  to  cyberattacks  or  other  cyber  incidents,  our  business  has  been  and  can  continue  to  be  adversely  affected,  which  has
resulted  in  and  can  continue  to  result  in  some  or  all  of  the  following:  transaction  errors,  processing  inefficiencies,  inability  to
access our data or systems, lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses,
distribution centers or other facilities, intellectual property or other data loss, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings,
inquiries  or  investigations,  fines  or  penalties,  remediation  costs,  damage  to  our  reputation  or  a  negative  impact  on  employee
morale and the loss of current or potential customers.

Similar risks exist with respect to third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers, that we
rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing,
health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the systems managed, hosted, provided
and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. For example, malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ
the  information  technology  supply  chain  to  introduce  malware  through  software  updates  or  compromised  supplier  accounts  or
hardware.  The  need  to  coordinate  with  various  third-party  service  providers,  including  with  respect  to  timely  notification  and
access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve issues that arise. As a result,
we are subject to the risk that

17

Table of Contents

the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does
not directly impact our systems or information.

Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our
business,  such  incidents  or  disruptions  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us  in  the  future.  While  we  devote  significant
resources  to  network  security,  disaster  recovery,  employee  training  and  other  measures  to  secure  our  information  technology
systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against
all  cyber  incidents,  systems  disruptions,  system  compromises  or  misuses  of  data.  In  addition,  while  we  currently  maintain
insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber
incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances
surrounding  an  incident,  cover  all  losses  or  all  types  of  claims  that  arise  from  an  incident,  or  the  damage  to  our  reputation  or
brands that may result from an incident.

Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business.

We  regularly  review  our  portfolio  of  businesses  and  evaluate  potential  acquisitions,  joint  ventures,  distribution  agreements,
divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions, including the recent completion of
the  Juice  Transaction,  is  dependent  upon,  among  other  things,  our  ability  to  realize  the  full  extent  of  the  expected  returns,
benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary
consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution,
sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company
or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business
models  or  in  new  categories  or  territories;  motivating,  recruiting  and  retaining  executives  and  key  employees;  conforming
controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with
respect  to  environmental  compliance,  health  and  safety  compliance  and  compliance  with  anti-bribery  laws);  retaining  existing
customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good
relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with
divested  brands  or  businesses;  managing  the  impact  of  business  decisions  or  other  actions  or  omissions  of  our  joint  venture
partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities
and  litigation.  Strategic  transactions  that  are  not  successfully  completed  or  managed  effectively,  or  our  failure  to  effectively
manage  the  risks  associated  with  such  transactions,  have  in  the  past  and  could  continue  to  result  in  adverse  effects  on  our
business.

Our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can have an adverse effect on our business.

We  rely  on  third-party  service  providers,  including  cloud  data  service  providers,  for  certain  areas  of  our  business,  including
payroll  processing,  health  and  benefit  plan  administration  and  certain  finance  and  accounting  functions.  Failure  by  these  third
parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance,
has  in  the  past  and  could  continue  to  result  in  our  inability  to  achieve  the  expected  cost  savings  or  efficiencies  and  result  in
additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead
to  business  disruption,  systems  performance  degradation,  processing  inefficiencies  or  other  systems  disruptions,  the  loss  of  or
damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial
reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs,

18

Table of Contents

damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our business.

In addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including
our  financial  processing  systems,  to  enterprise-wide  systems  solutions  and  have  begun  to  roll  out  these  systems  in  certain
countries  and  divisions.  We  have  experienced  and  could  continue  to  experience  systems  outages  and  operating  inefficiencies
following  these  planned  implementations.  In  addition,  if  we  do  not  continue  to  allocate  and  effectively  manage  the  resources
necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from
this initiative, our business could be adversely affected.

Climate change or measures to address climate change can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation.

Climate  change  may  have  a  negative  effect  on  agricultural  productivity  which  may  result  in  decreased  availability  or  less
favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats,
oranges and other fruits (and fruit-derived oils). In addition, climate change may also increase the frequency or severity of natural
disasters and other extreme weather conditions (including rising temperatures and drought), which could pose physical risks to
our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Also, there is an
increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental
policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use
plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing
programs, which could result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a
result,  the  effects  of  climate  change  can  negatively  affect  our  business  and  operations.  In  addition,  any  failure  to  achieve  our
goals  with  respect  to  reducing  our  impact  on  the  environment  or  perception  of  a  failure  to  act  responsibly  with  respect  to  the
environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, which
could adversely affect demand for our products or damage our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.

Strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer.

Many  of  our  employees  are  covered  by  collective  bargaining  agreements,  and  other  employees  may  seek  to  be  covered  by
collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the
future  if  we  are  unable  to  renew,  or  enter  into  new,  collective  bargaining  agreements  on  satisfactory  terms  and  can  impair
manufacturing and distribution of our products, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully
implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which
can adversely affect our business.

Financial Risks

Failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely affect our financial performance.

Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including our multi-year
phased  implementation  of  shared  business  service  organizational  models.  We  continue  to  identify  and  implement  productivity
initiatives  that  we  believe  will  position  our  business  for  long-term  sustainable  growth  by  allowing  us  to  achieve  a  lower  cost
structure,  improve  decision-making  and  operate  more  efficiently.  Some  of  these  measures  result  in  unintended  consequences,
such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity, unexpected

19

Table of Contents

employee  attrition,  an  inability  to  attract  or  retain  key  personnel  and  negative  publicity.  If  we  are  unable  to  successfully
implement our productivity initiatives as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives, we may not
realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance.

A deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business can result in
an impairment charge that can adversely affect our results of operations.

We  conduct  impairment  tests  on  our  goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  annually  or  more  frequently  if
circumstances  indicate  that  impairment  may  have  occurred.  In  addition,  amortizable  intangible  assets,  property,  plant  and
equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment.  A  deterioration  in  our  underlying  assumptions  regarding  the  impact  of  competitive  operating  conditions,
macroeconomic  conditions  or  other  factors  used  to  estimate  the  future  performance  of  any  of  our  reporting  units  or  assets,
including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, can result in an
impairment charge, which can adversely affect our results of operations.

Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance.

Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside
the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global
operations,  we  also  pay  for  the  ingredients,  raw  materials  and  commodities  used  in  our  business  in  numerous  currencies.
Fluctuations  in  exchange  rates,  including  as  a  result  of  inflation,  central  bank  monetary  policies,  currency  controls  or  other
currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance.

Our  borrowing  costs  and  access  to  capital  and  credit  markets  can  be  adversely  affected  by  a  downgrade  or  potential
downgrade of our credit ratings.

Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability,
levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors
beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access,
which  we  believe  will  facilitate  appropriate  financial  flexibility  and  ready  access  to  global  credit  markets  at  favorable  interest
rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any
downgrade  to  below  investment  grade,  can  increase  our  future  borrowing  costs,  impair  our  ability  to  access  capital  and  credit
markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the
commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more
heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance.

Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks

Taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on
the  manufacture,  distribution  or  sale  of  certain  of  our  products,  particularly  our  beverages,  as  a  result  of  the  ingredients  or
substances  contained  in  our  products.  These  taxes  vary  in  scope  and  form:  some  apply  to  all  beverages,  including  non-caloric
beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single
tax  rate  per  ounce/liter  on  beverages  containing  over  a  certain  amount  of  added  sugar  (or  other  sweetener),  some  apply  a
graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate
on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, certain provinces in Canada enacted a flat
tax on all sugar-sweetened beverages, effective

20

Table of Contents

September 1, 2022, at a rate of 0.20 Canadian dollars (0.16 U.S. dollars) per liter. These tax measures, whatever their scope or
form,  have  in  the  past  and  could  continue  to  increase  the  cost  of  certain  of  our  products,  reduce  overall  consumption  of  our
products or lead to negative publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

Limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  are  sold  have  either  imposed,  or  are  considering  imposing,  limitations  on  the
marketing  or  sale  of  our  products  as  a  result  of  ingredients  or  substances  in  our  products.  These  limitations  require  that  we
highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present
in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products
may be available. For example, Argentina and Colombia enacted warning labeling requirements in 2021 to indicate whether a
particular pre-packaged food or beverage product is considered to be high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. Certain jurisdictions
have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used
to  indicate  various  levels  of  a  particular  ingredient,  such  as  sugar,  sodium  or  saturated  fat,  in  products.  The  imposition  or
proposed  imposition  of  additional  limitations  on  the  marketing  or  sale  of  our  products  has  in  the  past  and  could  continue  to
reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products
do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business
and financial performance.

We rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers. Certain of our products are
sold in packaging designed to be recyclable or commercially compostable. However, not all packaging is recycled, whether due
to  lack  of  infrastructure  or  otherwise,  and  certain  of  our  packaging  is  not  currently  recyclable.  Packaging  waste  not  properly
disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity,
litigation  or  reduced  consumer  demand  for  our  products,  adversely  affecting  our  financial  performance.  Many  jurisdictions  in
which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of
sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging.
These  regulations  vary  in  form  and  scope  and  include  extended  producer  responsibility  policies,  plastic  or  packaging  taxes,
restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, bans on the use of single-use
plastics and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union, Peru and certain states in the United States,
among  other  jurisdictions,  have  imposed  a  minimum  recycled  content  requirement  for  beverage  bottle  packaging  and  similar
legislation  is  under  consideration  in  other  jurisdictions.  These  laws  and  regulations  have  in  the  past  and  could  continue  to
increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business
partners,  including  our  independent  bottlers,  to  increase  capital  expenditures  to  invest  in  minimizing  the  amount  of  plastic  or
other  materials  used  in  our  packaging  or  to  develop  alternative  packaging,  all  of  which  can  adversely  affect  our  business  and
financial performance.

Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business.

We  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  continuously  evolving  and  developing  laws  and  regulations  in  numerous  jurisdictions  regarding
personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to
country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to
comply with these laws and

21

Table of Contents

regulations, including with respect to data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection
Regulation or residents of the state of California who are covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the
California  Privacy  Rights  Act),  impose  significant  costs  and  challenges  that  are  likely  to  continue  to  increase  over  time,
particularly as additional jurisdictions adopt similar regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise
protect  personal  data  from  unauthorized  access,  use  or  other  processing,  have  in  the  past  and  could  in  the  future  result  in
litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines or penalties, all of
which can adversely affect our business.

Increases  in  income  tax  rates,  changes  in  income  tax  laws  or  disagreements  with  tax  authorities  can  adversely  affect  our
financial performance.

Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced,
can adversely affect our financial performance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject
to  taxes,  including  the  United  States,  have  in  the  past  and  could  continue  to  result  in  significant  changes  in  tax  legislation  or
regulation, including those proposed and under consideration by the United States Congress and the Organization for Economic
Co-operation  and  Development.  For  example,  numerous  countries  have  recently  agreed  to  a  statement  in  support  of  a  global
minimum tax rate of 15% as well as global profit reallocation. There can be no assurance that these changes will be adopted by
individual  countries,  or  that  once  adopted  by  individual  countries,  that  they  will  not  have  adverse  effects  on  our  financial
performance. This increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty,
resulting  in  higher  compliance  costs  and  adverse  effects  on  our  financial  performance.  We  are  also  subject  to  regular  reviews,
examinations  and  audits  by  numerous  taxing  authorities  with  respect  to  income  and  non-income  based  taxes.  Economic  and
political  pressures  to  increase  tax  revenues  in  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate,  or  the  adoption  of  new  or  reformed  tax
legislation or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax
audits  and  any  related  litigation  can  differ  from  our  historical  provisions  and  accruals,  resulting  in  an  adverse  effect  on  our
financial performance.

If  we  are  unable  to  adequately  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights,  or  if  we  are  found  to  infringe  on  the  intellectual
property rights of others, our business can be adversely affected.

We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights,
patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of
protection  of  intellectual  property.  Our  competitive  position  and  the  value  of  our  products  and  brands  can  be  reduced  and  our
business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas,
or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also, in the
course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past infringed or been alleged to
have  infringed,  and  could  in  the  future  infringe  or  be  alleged  to  infringe,  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others.  Such
infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption
to  our  operations,  injunctions  against  development,  manufacturing,  use  and/or  sale  of  certain  products,  inventory  write-offs  or
other  limitations  on  our  ability  to  introduce  new  products  or  improve  the  quality  of  existing  products,  resulting  in  an  adverse
effect on our business.

Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business.

The  conduct  of  our  business  is  subject  to  numerous  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  the  production,  storage,  distribution,  sale,
display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content (including whether a product

22

Table of Contents

contains  genetically  engineered  ingredients),  quality,  safety,  transportation,  traceability,  sourcing  (including  pesticide  use),
packaging,  disposal,  recycling  and  use  of  our  products  or  raw  materials,  employment  and  occupational  health  and  safety,
environmental, social and governance matters (including climate change) and data privacy and protection. In addition, in many
jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance
with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations
thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures
and  higher  production  costs,  resulting  in  adverse  effects  on  our  business.  For  example,  increasing  governmental  and  societal
attention  to  environmental,  social  and  governance  matters  has  resulted  and  could  continue  to  result  in  new  laws  or  regulatory
requirements.  In  addition,  the  entry  into  new  markets  or  categories,  including  our  planned  entry  into  the  alcoholic  beverage
industry  as  a  distributor  in  the  United  States  and  expansion  into  the  nuts  and  meat  convenient  foods  categories  globally,  has
resulted  in  and  could  continue  to  result  in  our  business  being  subject  to  additional  regulations  resulting  in  higher  compliance
costs. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale
of our products, other jurisdictions may follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil
enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of
which  can  adversely  affect  our  business.  In  addition,  the  results  of  third-party  studies  (whether  or  not  scientifically  valid)
purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products
or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits
that can adversely affect our business.

Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an
adverse impact on our business.

We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations,
including  but  not  limited  to  matters  related  to  our  advertising,  marketing  or  commercial  practices,  product  labels,  claims  and
ingredients, personal injury and property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters,
environmental, social and governance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These
matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment
of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the
ultimate  outcome  of  such  matters.  Responding  to  these  matters,  even  those  that  are  ultimately  non-meritorious,  requires  us  to
incur  significant  expense  and  devote  significant  resources,  and  may  generate  adverse  publicity  that  damages  our  reputation  or
brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180
days or more preceding the end of our 2021 year and that remain unresolved.

contract manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our
properties generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for
our current operations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations.
While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with
certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

OUR BUSINESS

Executive Overview

PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lays,
Doritos,  Cheetos,  Gatorade,  Pepsi-Cola,  Mountain  Dew,  Quaker  and  SodaStream.  Through  our  operations,  authorized  bottlers,
contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient
foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.

As  a  global  company  with  deep  local  ties,  we  faced  many  of  the  same  challenges  in  2021  as  our  consumers,  customers,  and
competitors across the world, including the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; supply chain
disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a
rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an
evolving regulatory landscape.

To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called PepsiCo Positive (pep+). pep+ is
a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of how the company will strive to create
growth  and  value  by  operating  within  planetary  boundaries  and  inspiring  positive  change  for  the  planet  and  people.  pep+  will
guide how we will work to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a
more  sustainable  way,  to  leveraging  our  more  than  one  billion  connections  with  consumers  each  day  to  take  sustainability
mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.

pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals
under a comprehensive framework:

• Positive  Agriculture:  We  are  working  to  spread  regenerative  practices  to  restore  the  Earth  across  land  equal  to  the
company's entire agricultural footprint (approximately 7 million acres), sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and
improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain.

• Positive Value Chain: We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to: achieve net-zero
emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain.
Our  packaging  goals  include  cutting  virgin  plastic  per  serving,  using  recycled  content  in  our  plastic  packaging,  and
scaling  our  SodaStream  business  globally,  an  innovative  platform  that  almost  entirely  eliminates  the  need  for  beverage
packaging, among other levers. Additionally, we are making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey. And
we have introduced a new global workforce volunteering program, One Smile at a

Time, to encourage, support and empower each one of our approximately 309,000 employees to make positive impacts in
their local communities.

• Positive Choices: We continue working to evolve our portfolio of beverage and convenient food products so that they are
better  for  the  planet  and  people,  including  by  incorporating  more  diverse  ingredients  in  both  new  and  existing  food
products that are better for the planet and/or deliver nutritional benefits, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and
whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category, where PepsiCo is already the global branded leader,
including leadership positions in Mexico, China and several Western European markets; and accelerating our reduction of
added  sugars  and  sodium  through  the  use  of  science-based  targets  across  our  portfolio  and  cooking  our  food  offerings
with  healthier  oils.  We  are  also  continuing  to  scale  new  business  models  that  require  little  or  no  single-use  packaging,
including  SodaStream  –  an  icon  of  a  Positive  Choice  and  the  largest  sparkling  water  brand  in  the  world  by  volume.
SodaStream, already sold in more than 40 countries, and its new SodaStream Professional platform is expected to expand
into functional beverages and reach additional markets by the end of 2022, part of the brand's effort to help consumers
avoid plastic bottles.

We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.

Our Operations

See  “Item  1.  Business”  for  information  on  our  divisions  and  a  description  of  our  distribution  network,  ingredients  and  other
supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers, competition and human capital. In addition, see Note 1 to
our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas.

Other Relationships

Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do
not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and
customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In
addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo
and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.

Our Business Risks

COVID-19

Our  global  operations  continue  to  expose  us  to  risks  associated  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  continues  to  result  in
challenging  operating  environments  and  has  affected  almost  all  of  the  more  than  200  countries  and  territories  in  which  our
products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold.  Numerous  measures  have  been  implemented  around  the  world  to  try  to
reduce  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travel  bans  and  restrictions,  quarantines,  curfews,  restrictions  on  public  gatherings,
shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures. These measures have impacted and will continue to
impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors,
joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, which may continue to result in changes in
demand  for  our  products,  increases  in  operating  costs  (whether  as  a  result  of  changes  to  our  supply  chain  or  increases  in
employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal protective
equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through labor shortages, raw

31

Table of Contents

material shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any of which
can  impact  our  ability  to  make,  manufacture,  distribute  and  sell  our  products.  In  addition,  measures  that  impact  our  ability  to
access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our business partners to
do  the  same  or  the  inability  of  a  significant  portion  of  our  or  our  business  partners’  workforce  to  work  because  of  illness,
absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions, may continue to impact the availability
or productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely.

Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers,
including  due  to  consumers  not  leaving  their  homes  or  leaving  their  homes  less  often  than  they  did  prior  to  the  start  of  the
pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have
or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result
of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially,
or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with
the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. Changes in
consumer  purchasing  and  consumption  patterns  may  increase  demand  for  our  products  in  one  quarter,  resulting  in  decreased
demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from
sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of
restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-
from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see an increase in demand in the
e-commerce  and  online-to-offline  channels  and  any  failure  to  capitalize  on  this  demand  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to
maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position.

Any  reduced  demand  for  our  products  or  change  in  consumer  purchasing  and  consumption  patterns,  as  well  as  continued
economic uncertainty (including supply chain disruptions and labor shortages), can adversely affect our customers’ and business
partners’  financial  condition,  which  can  result  in  bankruptcy  filings  and/or  an  inability  to  pay  for  our  products,  reduced  or
canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools
or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to
supply  us  with  ingredients  or  other  items  necessary  for  us  to  make,  manufacture,  distribute  or  sell  our  products.  Such  adverse
changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording
additional  charges  for  our  inability  to  recover  or  collect  any  accounts  receivable,  owned  or  leased  assets,  including  certain
foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with
the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access
these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.

While  we  have  developed  and  implemented  and  continue  to  develop  and  implement  health  and  safety  protocols,  business
continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and
our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous
evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration
and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the omicron and delta variants, the
development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of
vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic,
governmental actions that have been

32

Table of Contents

taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic,
some of which may be more than just temporary.

Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain

Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices
we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase
orders,  pricing  agreements  and  derivative  instruments,  including  swaps  and  futures.  During  2021,  we  experienced  higher  than
anticipated transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue in 2022. A number of external factors, including the
COVID-19  pandemic,  adverse  weather  conditions,  supply  chain  disruptions  (including  raw  material  shortages)  and  labor
shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and commodity availability and costs. When prices increase,
we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating
results.

See  Note  9  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information  on  how  we  manage  our  exposure  to  commodity
prices.

Risks Associated with Climate Change

Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing,  new  or  increased  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  to  reduce  or  mitigate  the  potential  effects  of  climate  change,
including  regulation  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  potential  carbon  pricing  programs.  These  new  or  increased  legal  or
regulatory  requirements  could  result  in  significant  increased  costs  of  compliance  and  additional  investments  in  facilities  and
equipment.  However,  we  are  unable  to  predict  the  scope,  nature  and  timing  of  any  new  or  increased  environmental  laws  and
regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We
continue  to  monitor  existing  and  proposed  laws  and  regulations  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  are  made,
manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of
such laws or regulations.

Risks Associated with International Operations

We are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the periods presented
in  this  report,  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in  certain
developing and emerging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social
conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the
economic,  operating  and  political  environment  in  these  markets  closely  and  to  identify  actions  to  potentially  mitigate  any
unfavorable impacts on our future results.

Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products

Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering
imposing,  new  or  increased  taxes  or  regulations  on  the  manufacture,  distribution  or  sale  of  our  products  or  their  packaging,
ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of
our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope
and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages
with  a  caloric  sweetener  (e.g.,  sugar).  In  addition,  COVID-19  has  resulted  in  increased  regulatory  focus  on  labeling  in  certain
jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our
products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using
certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging,

33

Table of Contents

encourage  waste  reduction  and  increased  recycling  rates  or  facilitate  the  waste  management  process  or  restrict  the  sale  of
products in certain packaging.

We  sell  a  wide  variety  of  beverages  and  convenient  foods  in  more  than  200  countries  and  territories  and  the  profile  of  the
products  we  sell,  the  amount  of  revenue  attributable  to  such  products  and  the  type  of  packaging  used  vary  by  jurisdiction.
Because  of  this,  we  cannot  predict  the  scope  or  form  potential  taxes,  regulations  or  other  limitations  on  our  products  or  their
packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In
addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and
proposed  taxes  and  regulations  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  are  made,  manufactured,  distributed  and  sold  and  to
consider  actions  we  may  take  to  potentially  mitigate  the  unfavorable  impact,  if  any,  of  such  taxes,  regulations  or  limitations,
including  advocating  alternative  measures  with  respect  to  the  imposition,  form  and  scope  of  any  such  taxes,  regulations  or
limitations.

Retail Landscape

Our  industry  continues  to  be  affected  by  disruption  of  the  retail  landscape,  including  the  rapid  growth  in  sales  through  e-
commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and
digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see
a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-
commerce  and  digital  capabilities,  such  as  expanding  our  direct-to-consumer  business,  and  distribute  our  products  effectively
through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.

See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks
and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.

Risk Management Framework

The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To
identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’s operations, we leverage
an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:

•

PepsiCo’s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework. One of
the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of
the Company’s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’s top risks. The Board receives
updates  on  key  risks  throughout  the  year,  including  risks  related  to  food  safety  and  cybersecurity.  During  2021,  in
addition  to  COVID-19  discussions  as  part  of  risk  updates  to  the  Board  and  the  relevant  Committees,  the  Board  was
provided  with  updates  on  COVID-19’s  impact  to  our  business,  financial  condition  and  operations  through  memos,
teleconferences or other appropriate means of communication. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees
of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly
on these matters.

◦ The  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  reviews  and  assesses  the  guidelines  and  policies  governing  PepsiCo’s  risk
management  and  oversight  processes,  and  assists  the  Board’s  oversight  of  financial,  compliance  and  employee
safety risks facing PepsiCo;

34

Table of Contents

◦ The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’s employee compensation policies and practices to

assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;

◦

◦

The  Nominating  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  assists  the  Board  in  its  oversight  of  the  Company’s
governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and

The  Sustainability,  Diversity  and  Public  Policy  Committee  of  the  Board  assists  the  Board  in  its  oversight  of
PepsiCo’s  policies,  programs  and  related  risks  that  concern  key  sustainability  (including  climate  change),
diversity, equity and inclusion, and public policy matters.

• The  PepsiCo  Risk  Committee  (PRC),  which  is  comprised  of  a  cross-functional,  geographically  diverse,  senior
management  group,  including  PepsiCo’s  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  meets
regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and
other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board;

• Division  and  key  market  risk  committees,  comprised  of  cross-functional  senior  management  teams,  meet  regularly  to

identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;

•

•

•

PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance,
tools  and  analytical  support  to  the  PRC  and  the  division  and  key  country  risk  committees,  identifies  and  assesses
potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’s Board of Directors,
the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board;

PepsiCo’s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic
audit and review procedures; and

PepsiCo’s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.

Market Risks

We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:

•

•

•

commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;

foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and

interest rates.

In  the  normal  course  of  business,  we  manage  commodity  price,  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks  through  a  variety  of
strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve
the  identification  and  effective  implementation  of  meaningful  cost-saving  opportunities  or  efficiencies,  including  the  use  of
derivatives.  Our  global  purchasing  programs  include  fixed-price  contracts  and  purchase  orders  and  pricing  agreements.  See
“Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks.

The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market
fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and
our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and
retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.

35

Table of Contents

Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our
products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.

Commodity Prices

Our  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1  billion  as  of
December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10%
decrease  in  the  underlying  commodity  price,  would  have  decreased  our  net  unrealized  gains  in  2021  by  $177  million,  which
would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.

Foreign Exchange

Our  operations  outside  of  the  United  States  generated  44%  of  our  consolidated  net  revenue  in  2021,  with  Mexico,  Russia,
Canada,  China,  the  United  Kingdom  and  South  Africa,  collectively,  comprising  approximately  23%  of  our  consolidated  net
revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are
made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign
subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During
2021,  favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  1  percentage  point  to  net  revenue  growth,  primarily  due  to  appreciation  in  the
Mexican  peso,  Canadian  dollar  and  South  African  rand.  Currency  declines  against  the  U.S.  dollar  which  are  not  offset  could
adversely impact our future financial results.

In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made,
manufactured,  distributed  or  sold,  including  in  Argentina,  Brazil,  China,  Mexico,  the  Middle  East,  Russia  and  Turkey,  and
currency  controls  or  fluctuations  in  certain  of  these  international  markets,  continue  to,  and  the  threat  or  imposition  of  new  or
increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating
environments.

Our  foreign  currency  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.8  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.9  billion  as  of
December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would
have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the
fair value of the underlying exposure.

The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021
and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.

Interest Rates

Our  interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0  billion  as  of
December 26, 2020. Assuming year-end 2021 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest
rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2021 by $47 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-
term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

Results of Operations — Consolidated Review

Volume

Physical  or  unit  volume  is  one  of  the  key  metrics  management  uses  internally  to  make  operating  and  strategic  decisions,
including  the  preparation  of  our  annual  operating  plan  and  the  evaluation  of  our  business  performance.  We  believe  volume
provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and
provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer
level.

36

Table of Contents

Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-
owned  or  licensed  trademarks  and  allied  brand  products  and  joint  venture  trademarks  sold  by  company-owned  bottling
operations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by
our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents
(CSE),  whereas  finished  beverage  product  volume  is  reported  in  bottler  case  sales  (BCS).  Both  CSE  and  BCS  convert  all
beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing
of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on
BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of
our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties,
make,  market,  distribute  and  sell  ready-to-drink  tea  products  through  a  joint  venture  with  Unilever  (under  the  Lipton  brand
name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink
coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-
branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi.

Convenient  food  volume  includes  volume  sold  by  our  subsidiaries  and  noncontrolled  affiliates  of  convenient  food  products
bearing  company-owned  or  licensed  trademarks.  Internationally,  we  measure  convenient  food  product  volume  in  kilograms,
while  in  North  America  we  measure  convenient  food  product  volume  in  pounds.  FLNA  makes,  markets,  distributes  and  sells
Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group.

See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.

Operating profit grew 11% and operating margin declined 0.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by
net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 14-percentage-point impact of
higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The operating margin decline primarily reflects higher
commodity costs.

Lower  charges  taken  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  compared  to  the  prior  year  contributed  6  percentage  points  to
operating  profit  growth.  Additionally,  lower  acquisition  and  divestiture-related  charges  included  in  “Items  Affecting
Comparability” contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Juice Transaction

In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39%
noncontrolling  interest  in  a  newly  formed  joint  venture  that  will  operate  across  North  America  and  Europe.  These  juice
businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the
new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. See Note 13
to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Results of Operations — Division Review

See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider
when  evaluating  our  results  and  related  information  regarding  measures  not  in  accordance  with  U.S.  Generally  Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP).

In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete
pricing  actions,  sales  incentive  activities  and  mix  resulting  from  selling  varying  products  in  different  package  sizes  and  in
different  countries  and  “net  pricing”  reflects  the  year-over-year  combined  impact  of  list  price  changes,  weight  changes  per
package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well
as  divestitures  and  other  structural  changes,  including  changes  in  ownership  or  control  in  consolidated  subsidiaries  and
nonconsolidated equity investees.

Net  revenue  grew  8%,  primarily  driven  by  effective  net  pricing  and  organic  volume  growth.  Unit  volume  grew  2%,  primarily
reflecting  double-digit  growth  in  variety  packs  and  the  impact  of  our  BFY  Brands,  Inc.  (BFY  Brands)  acquisition  in  the  first
quarter  of  2020,  partially  offset  by  a  low-single-digit  decline  in  trademark  Tostitos  and  a  double-digit  decline  in  trademark
Santitas.

Operating  profit  increased  5.5%,  primarily  reflecting  the  net  revenue  growth,  productivity  savings  and  a  3-percentage-point
impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating
cost  increases,  including  strategic  initiatives  and  incremental  transportation  costs,  and  a  4-percentage-point  impact  of  higher
commodity costs, primarily packaging material and cooking oil.

QFNA

Net revenue grew slightly and unit volume declined 7%. The net revenue growth reflects effective net pricing and a 1-percentage-
point  impact  of  favorable  foreign  exchange,  largely  offset  by  a  decrease  in  organic  volume.  The  unit  volume  decline  was
primarily driven by double-digit declines in pancake syrups and mixes and in ready-to-eat cereals and a high-single-digit decline
in oatmeal, partially offset by growth in Cheetos macaroni and cheese, which was introduced in the third quarter of 2020, and
double-digit growth in lite snacks.

Operating profit declined 14%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs,
and an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact
on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance compared to the significant COVID-19 related surge in consumer
demand in the prior year.

PBNA

Net revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. Unit volume increased
6%, driven by a 7% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume and a 4% increase in CSD volume. The NCB volume
increase primarily reflected double-digit increases in our

40

Table of Contents

overall  water  portfolio  and  our  energy  portfolio,  a  low-single-digit  increase  in  Gatorade  sports  drinks  and  a  mid-single-digit
increase in Lipton ready-to-drink teas.

Operating profit increased 26%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, a 15-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken
as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  productivity  savings.  These  impacts  were  partially  offset  by  certain  operating  cost
increases,  including  incremental  transportation  costs,  an  18-percentage-point  impact  of  higher  commodity  costs  and  higher
advertising and marketing expenses. Higher prior-year acquisition and divestiture-related charges contributed 4 percentage points
to operating profit growth.

Changes  in  consumer  behavior  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  contributed  to  a  current-year  increase  in  consumer
demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance.

In 2020, we received a notice of termination without cause from Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which would end our distribution
rights of Bang Energy drinks, effective October 24, 2023.

LatAm

Net revenue increased 17%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth.

Convenient foods unit volume grew 3.5%, primarily reflecting low-single-digit growth in Brazil and Mexico.

Beverage  unit  volume  grew  8%,  primarily  reflecting  double-digit  growth  in  Argentina  and  Chile.  Additionally,  Brazil
experienced low-single-digit growth, Mexico experienced mid-single-digit growth and Guatemala experienced high-single-digit
growth.

Operating  profit  increased  33%,  primarily  reflecting  the  net  revenue  growth,  productivity  savings  and  a  4.5-percentage-point
impact of favorable foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 30-percentage-
point  impact  of  higher  commodity  costs  and  higher  advertising  and  marketing  expenses.  A  current-year  recognition  of  certain
indirect tax credits in Brazil and lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 6 percentage points and
4 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth.

Changes  in  consumer  behavior  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  contributed  to  a  current-year  increase  in  consumer
demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance.

Europe

Net revenue increased 9%, primarily reflecting organic volume growth and effective net pricing.

Convenient  foods  unit  volume  grew  4%,  primarily  reflecting  double-digit  growth  in  Turkey  and  mid-single-digit  growth  in
Russia  and  Poland,  partially  offset  by  a  mid-single-digit  decline  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Additionally,  the  Netherlands  grew
slightly and France experienced low-single-digit growth.

Beverage unit volume grew 8%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom and high-
single-digit growth in France, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Germany.

Operating  profit  decreased  4.5%,  primarily  reflecting  certain  operating  cost  increases,  a  28-percentage-point  impact  of  higher
commodity costs and a 2.5-percentage-point impact each from higher restructuring and impairment charges and a gain on an asset
sale in the prior year. These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Additionally, lower
charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the
prior

year positively contributed 5 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit performance.

Changes  in  consumer  behavior  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  contributed  to  a  current-year  increase  in  consumer
demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue and unit volume performance.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in the United Kingdom
caused a temporary disruption to our United Kingdom operations which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and
operating profit performance. These issues were largely resolved within the quarter and the business operations had resumed by
year end.

AMESA

Net revenue increased 33%, reflecting a 14-percentage-point impact of our Pioneer Foods acquisition, which included the impact
of an extra month of net revenue compared to the prior year as we aligned Pioneer Foods’ reporting calendar with that of our
AMESA  division,  as  well  as  organic  volume  growth  and  effective  net  pricing.  Favorable  foreign  exchange  contributed  4.5
percentage points to net revenue growth.

Convenient  foods  unit  volume  grew  38%,  primarily  reflecting  a  35-percentage-point  impact  of  our  Pioneer  Foods  acquisition,
which included the impact of an extra month of unit volume as we aligned Pioneer Foods’ reporting calendar with that of our
AMESA division, double-digit growth in India and Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by a
low-single-digit decline in South Africa (excluding our Pioneer Foods acquisition).

Beverage unit volume grew 20%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in India and Pakistan. Additionally, the Middle East
experienced double-digit growth and Nigeria experienced high-single-digit growth.

Operating  profit  increased  43%,  primarily  reflecting  the  net  revenue  growth,  a  31-percentage-point  impact  of  the  prior-year
acquisition and divestiture-related charges associated with our Pioneer Foods acquisition and productivity savings. These impacts
were  partially  offset  by  certain  operating  cost  increases,  a  13-percentage-point  impact  of  higher  commodity  costs  and  higher
advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our Pioneer
Foods acquisition contributed 3 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth.

Changes  in  consumer  behavior  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  contributed  to  a  current-year  increase  in  consumer
demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance.

APAC

Net revenue increased 34%, reflecting a 15-percentage-point impact of our Be & Cheery acquisition, which included the impact
of an extra month of net revenue compared to the prior year as we aligned Be & Cheery’s reporting calendar with that of our
APAC division, as well as organic volume growth, a 6- percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange and effective net
pricing.

Convenient  foods  unit  volume  grew  19%,  primarily  reflecting  a  16-percentage-point  impact  of  our  Be  &  Cheery  acquisition,
which included the impact of an extra month of unit volume as we aligned Be & Cheery’s reporting calendar with that of our
APAC division, and double-digit growth in China (excluding our Be & Cheery acquisition) and Thailand. Additionally, Australia,
Indonesia and Taiwan each experienced low-single-digit growth.

42

Table of Contents

Beverage unit volume grew 13%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in China, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline
in Vietnam. Additionally, the Philippines experienced low-single-digit growth and Thailand experienced mid-single-digit growth.

Operating  profit  increased  14%,  primarily  reflecting  the  net  revenue  growth,  productivity  savings  and  a  2-  percentage-point
contribution  from  our  Be  &  Cheery  acquisition,  partially  offset  by  certain  operating  cost  increases  and  higher  advertising  and
marketing  expenses.  Additionally,  impairment  charges  associated  with  an  equity  method  investment  reduced  operating  profit
growth by 3 percentage points. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth.

In 2021, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 7 percentage points to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth
and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $405 million, primarily reflecting lower settlement charges in 2021,
the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of plan changes approved in 2020, as discussed in Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements, and the impact of discretionary plan contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the expected
rate of return on plan assets.

Net  interest  expense  and  other  increased  $735  million,  reflecting  a  charge  of  $842  million  in  connection  with  our  cash  tender
offers.  See  Note  8  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information.  This  impact  was  partially  offset  by  lower
interest rates on average debt balances.

The  reported  tax  rate  increased  0.9  percentage  points,  primarily  reflecting  the  net  tax  impact  of  adjustments  to  uncertain  tax
positions related to the final assessment from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016.

Non-GAAP Measures

Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation
of  our  annual  operating  plan,  evaluation  of  our  overall  business  performance  and  as  a  factor  in  determining  compensation  for
certain employees. We  believe  presenting  non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  this Form 10-K provides additional information to
facilitate  comparison  of  our  historical  operating  results  and  trends  in  our  underlying  operating  results  and  provides  additional
transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to
view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or
that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we
may  make  adjustments  include:  amounts  related  to  mark-to-market  gains  or  losses  (non-cash);  charges  related  to  restructuring
plans;  costs  associated  with  mergers,  acquisitions,  divestitures  and  other  structural  changes;  gains  associated  with  divestitures;
pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or

43

Table of Contents

adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution
of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset
impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Previously, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-
related  settlement  and  curtailment  gains  and  losses  were  not  considered  items  affecting  comparability.  Pension  and  retiree
medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs will continue to be
reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP
financial measures in this Form 10-K.

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute  for  the  related  financial  information  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  In  addition,  our  non-GAAP  financial
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below:

Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net
interest  expense  and  other,  provision  for  income  taxes,  net  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  and  net  income
attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo
per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth
rates

These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do
not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019
Productivity  Plan),  costs  associated  with  our  acquisitions  and  divestitures,  the  impact  of  settlement  and  curtailment  gains  and
losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers and tax expense related to the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate
performance  on  operating  profit  and  net  income  attributable  to  PepsiCo  per  common  share  –  diluted,  each  adjusted  for  items
affecting  comparability,  on  a  constant  currency  basis,  which  measure  our  financial  results  assuming  constant  foreign  currency
exchange  rates  used  for  translation  based  on  the  rates  in  effect  for  the  comparable  prior-year  period.  In  order  to  compute  our
constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average
foreign  exchange  rates  and  then  multiply  or  divide,  as  appropriate,  those  amounts  by  the  prior-year  average  foreign  exchange
rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items
that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.

Organic revenue growth

We  define  organic  revenue  growth  as  a  measure  that  adjusts  for  the  impacts  of  foreign  exchange  translation,  acquisitions  and
divestitures,  and  where  applicable,  the  impact  of  an  additional  week  of  results  every  five  or  six  years  (53   reporting  week),
including  in  our  2022  financial  results.  Adjusting  for  acquisitions  and  divestitures  reflects  mergers  and  acquisitions  activity,
including the impact in 2021 of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our AMESA division and
Be & Cheery in our APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well
as  divestitures  and  other  structural  changes,  including  changes  in  ownership  or  control  in  consolidated  subsidiaries  and
nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our
business  because  it  excludes  items  that  we  believe  are  not  indicative  of  ongoing  performance  or  that  we  believe  impact
comparability with the prior year.

Free cash flow

We  define  free  cash  flow  as  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  less  capital  spending,  plus  sales  of  property,  plant  and
equipment.  Since  net  capital  spending  is  essential  to  our  product  innovation  initiatives  and  maintaining  our  operational
capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net
capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and
financing  activities,  including  debt  repayments,  dividends  and  share  repurchases.  Free  cash  flow  is  not  a  measure  of  cash
available  for  discretionary  expenditures  since  we  have  certain  non-discretionary  obligations  such  as  debt  service  that  are  not
deducted from the measure.

See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability

We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average
debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous
methods  exist  for  calculating  ROIC.  Accordingly,  the  method  used  by  management  to  calculate  ROIC  may  differ  from  the
methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.

We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC,
excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because
it  removes  from  our  operating  results  the  impact  of  items  that  we  believe  are  not  indicative  of  our  ongoing  performance  and
reflects  how  management  evaluates  our  operating  results  and  trends.  We  define  net  ROIC,  excluding  items  affecting
comparability,  as  ROIC,  adjusted  for  quarterly  average  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments,  after-tax  interest
income  and  items  affecting  comparability.  We  believe  the  calculation  of  ROIC  and  net  ROIC,  excluding  items  affecting
comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider
when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.

See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

Mark-to-Market Net Impact

We  centrally  manage  commodity  derivatives  on  behalf  of  our  divisions.  These  commodity  derivatives  include  agricultural
products,  energy  and  metals.  Commodity  derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  treatment  are  marked  to  market
each  period  with  the  resulting  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  corporate  unallocated  expenses  as  either  cost  of  sales  or  selling,
general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected
in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions
realize  the  economic  effects  of  the  derivative  without  experiencing  any  resulting  mark-to-market  volatility,  which  remains  in
corporate unallocated expenses.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

The  2019  Productivity  Plan,  publicly  announced  on  February  15,  2019,  will  leverage  new  technology  and  business  models  to
further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying
the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.
To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through
the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We now expect
to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared
to  our  previous  estimate  of  pre-tax  charges  of  approximately  $2.5  billion,  which  included  cash  expenditures  of  approximately
$1.6  billion.  Plan  to  date  through  December  25,  2021,  we  have  incurred  pre-tax  charges  of  $1.0  billion,  including  cash
expenditures of $776 million. In our 2022 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $350 million,
including  cash  expenditures  of  approximately  $300  million.  These  charges  will  be  funded  primarily  through  cash  from
operations.  We  expect  to  incur  the  majority  of  the  remaining  pre-tax  charges  and  cash  expenditures  in  our  2022  and  2023
financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026.

See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly
evaluate  productivity  initiatives  beyond  the  productivity  plan  and  other  initiatives  discussed  above  and  in  Note  3  to  our
consolidated financial statements.

Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges

Acquisition  and  divestiture-related  charges  primarily  include  fair  value  adjustments  to  the  acquired  inventory  included  in  the
acquisition-date  balance  sheets,  merger  and  integration  charges  and  costs  associated  with  divestitures.  Merger  and  integration
charges  include  liabilities  to  support  socioeconomic  programs  in  South  Africa,  closing  costs,  employee-related  costs,  gains
associated with contingent consideration, contract termination costs and other integration costs.

See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact

Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the
total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains related to plan changes.

See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Charge Related to Cash Tender Offers

As a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender price
paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash
tender offers.

See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act

Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.

Our Liquidity and Capital Resources

We  believe  that  our  cash  generating  capability  and  financial  condition,  together  with  our  revolving  credit  facilities,  working
capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing,
will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans.
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice
Transaction, proceeds obtained from  issuances  of  commercial  paper  and  long-term  debt,  and cash and cash equivalents. These
sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments
and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions, including support for socioeconomic programs in South Africa related
to our acquisition of Pioneer Foods; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital
expenditures  and  the  transition  tax  liability  under  the  TCJ  Act.  In  addition,  these  sources  of  cash  fund  other  cash  outflows
including  anticipated  dividend  payments  and  share  repurchases.  We  do  not  have  guarantees  or  off-balance  sheet  financing
arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Item 1A.
Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Our  sources  and  uses  of  cash  were  not  materially  adversely  impacted  by  COVID-19  and,  to  date,  we  have  not  identified  any
material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do
not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor
and  assess  the  impact  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  have  on  our  business  and  financial  results.  See  “Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,”
“Our  Business  Risks”  and  Note  1  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information  related  to  the  impact  of  the
COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results.

As of December 25, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency
controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.

The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in
our  consolidated  subsidiaries  outside  the  United  States  as  of  December  30,  2017.  As  of  December  25,  2021,  our  mandatory
transition  tax  liability  was  $2.9  billion,  which  must  be  paid  through  2026  under  the  provisions  of  the  TCJ  Act;  we  currently
expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2022. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our
recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the
TCJ Act.

As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the
extension  of  payment  terms.  Our  current  payment  terms  with  a  majority  of  our  suppliers  generally  range  from  60  to  90  days,
which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working
with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating
global  financial  institutions.  Under  these  agreements,  our  suppliers,  at  their  sole  discretion,  may  elect  to  sell  their  accounts
receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements
is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we
are  not  a  party  to  these  agreements.  These  financing  arrangements  allow  participating  suppliers  to  leverage  PepsiCo’s
creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable
terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any
third  party  in  connection  with  these  financing  arrangements.  We  have  no  economic  interest  in  our  suppliers’  decision  to
participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not
impacted. All

49

Table of Contents

outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and
other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of
December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who
participate  in  these  financing  arrangements  are  outstanding.  These  supply  chain  finance  arrangements  did  not  have  a  material
impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material
impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future.

Furthermore,  our  cash  provided  from  operating  activities  is  somewhat  impacted  by  seasonality.  Working  capital  needs  are
impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns and
generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and
enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and
other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

The table below summarizes our cash activity:

$

In 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.6 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in the prior year. The increase in
operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable working capital comparisons and operating profit performance, partially offset by
higher pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions and higher net cash tax payments in the current year.

Investing Activities

In 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $4.5 billion, partially
offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.

In  2020,  net  cash  used  for  investing  activities  was  $11.6  billion,  primarily  reflecting  net  cash  paid  in  connection  with  our
acquisitions of Rockstar of $3.85 billion, Pioneer Foods of $1.2 billion and Be & Cheery of $0.7 billion, net capital spending of
$4.2 billion, as well as purchases of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.

See  Note  1  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  discussion  of  capital  spending  by  division;  see  Note  9  to  our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities; and see Note 13 to our consolidated
financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions.

We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.

Financing Activities

In  2021,  net  cash  used  for  financing  activities  was  $10.8  billion,  primarily  reflecting  the  return  of  operating  cash  flow  to  our
shareholders largely through dividend payments of $5.8 billion, cash tender offers/debt redemption of $4.8 billion, payments of
long-term debt borrowings of $3.5 billion and

50

Table of Contents

payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term
debt of $4.1 billion.

In  2020,  net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $3.8  billion,  primarily  reflecting  proceeds  from  issuances  of  long-term
debt  of  $13.8  billion,  partially  offset  by  the  return  of  operating  cash  flow  to  our  shareholders  through  dividend  payments  and
share repurchases of $7.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.8 billion and debt redemptions of $1.1 billion.

See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.

We  annually  review  our  capital  structure  with  our  Board  of  Directors,  including  our  dividend  policy  and  share  repurchase
activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0
billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and expired on June 30, 2021. On February 10, 2022, we
announced  the  2022  share  repurchase  program.  See  “Item  5.  Market  for  Registrant’s  Common  Equity,  Related  Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for further information. In addition, on February 10, 2022, we announced a
7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid
in  June  2022.  We  expect  to  return  a  total  of  approximately  $7.7  billion  to  shareholders  in  2022,  comprising  dividends  of
approximately $6.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion.

Free Cash Flow

The  table below reconciles  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities,  as  reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash
flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see “Non-GAAP Measures.”

We  use  free  cash  flow  primarily  for  acquisitions  and  financing  activities,  including  debt  repayments,  dividends  and  share
repurchases.  We  expect  to  continue  to  return  free  cash  flow  to  our  shareholders  primarily  through  dividends  and  share
repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility
and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our
Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.

Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or
not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our
ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our
current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we
have  experienced  historically,  and  therefore  require  us  to  rely  more  heavily  on  more  expensive  types  of  debt  financing.  See
“Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
An appreciation of our critical accounting policies and estimates is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies
may  require  management  to  make  difficult  and  subjective  judgments  regarding  uncertainties,  including  those  related  to  the
COVID-19  pandemic,  and  as  a  result,  such  estimates  may  significantly  impact  our  financial  results.  The  precision  of  these
estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We
applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented.
We have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.

Our critical accounting policies and estimates are:

•
•
•
•

revenue recognition;
goodwill and other intangible assets;
income tax expense and accruals; and
pension and retiree medical plans.

Revenue Recognition

We  recognize  revenue  when  our  performance  obligation  is  satisfied.  Our  primary  performance  obligation  (the  distribution  and
sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is
also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that
do  not  allow  for  a  right  of  return.  However,  our  policy  for  DSD,  including  certain  chilled  products,  is  to  remove  and  replace
damaged  and  out-of-date  products  from  store  shelves  to  ensure  that  consumers  receive  the  product  quality  and  freshness  they
expect.  Similarly,  our  policy  for  certain  warehouse-distributed  products  is  to  replace  damaged  and  out-of-date  products.  As  a
result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.

Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices,  typically  require  payment  within  30  days  of  delivery  in  the  United  States,  and  generally  within  30  to  90  days
internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.

We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility,
write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the
expected impact of the global economic uncertainty

53

Table of Contents

related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for
certain of our customers.

Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to
regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with
customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks,
we monitor customer inventory levels.

As  discussed  in  “Our  Customers”  in  “Item  1.  Business,”  we  offer  sales  incentives  and  discounts  through  various  programs  to
customers  and  consumers.  Total  marketplace  spending  includes  sales  incentives,  discounts,  advertising  and  other  marketing
activities.  Sales  incentives  and  discounts  are  primarily  accounted  for  as  a  reduction  of  revenue  and  include  payments  to
customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new
products,  payments  for  shelf  space  and  discounts  to  promote  lower  retail  prices.  Sales  incentives  and  discounts  also  include
support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.

A  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume  rebates,  are  based  on
annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur
after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar
programs  and  require  management  judgment  with  respect  to  estimating  customer  and  consumer  participation  and  performance
levels.  Differences  between  estimated  expense  and  actual  incentive  costs  are  normally  insignificant  and  are  recognized  in
earnings  in  the  period  such  differences  are  determined.  In  addition,  certain  advertising  and  marketing  costs  are  also  based  on
annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.

See  Note  2  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information  on  our  revenue  recognition  and  related  policies,
including total marketplace spending.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed
as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is
first  assigned  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities,  including  brands  and  other  intangible  assets,  based  on  estimated  fair  values,
with  any  excess  recorded  as  goodwill.  Determining  fair  value  requires  significant  estimates  and  assumptions,  including  those
related to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life
cycles,  market  share,  consumer  awareness,  brand  history  and  future  expansion  expectations,  amount  and  timing  of  future  cash
flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.

We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the
intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria
are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the
expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market
share,  consumer  awareness,  brand  history,  future  expansion  expectations  and  regulatory  restrictions,  as  well  as  the
macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.

In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights
to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,
many factors were considered, including the pre-

54

Table of Contents

existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash
flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory,
contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived.
Franchise  rights  that  are  not  considered  indefinite-lived  are  amortized  over  the  remaining  contractual  period  of  the  contract  in
which the right was granted.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually,
using  either  a  qualitative  or  quantitative  approach.  We  perform  this  annual  assessment  during  our  third  quarter,  or  more
frequently  if  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  not  be  recoverable.  Where  we  use  the  qualitative  assessment,
first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include
macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory
environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment
indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.

In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair
value  of  the  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  and  the  reporting  unit,  respectively.  Estimated  fair  value  is  determined  using
discounted  cash  flows  and  requires  an  analysis  of  several  estimates  including  future  cash  flows  or  income  consistent  with
management’s  strategic  business  plans,  annual  sales  growth  rates,  perpetuity  growth  assumptions  and  the  selection  of
assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant
management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including
those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used
in  our  impairment  evaluations  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  goodwill,  such  as  forecasted  growth  rates  (including
perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are
consistent  with  our  internal  forecasts  and  operating  plans.  A  deterioration  in  these  assumptions  could  adversely  impact  our
results. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our
Business Risks.”

Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment.  If  an  evaluation  of  the  undiscounted  future  cash  flows  indicates  impairment,  the  asset  is  written  down  to  its
estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Income Tax Expense and Accruals

Our  annual  tax  rate  is  based  on  our  income,  statutory  tax  rates  and  tax  structure  and  transactions,  including  transfer  pricing
arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our
annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are
fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these
reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax
laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion.

An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual
item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is

55

Table of Contents

separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-
year tax matters to be among such items.

Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial
statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our
tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,
and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future
years  for  which  we  have  already  recorded  the  tax  benefit  on  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  establish  valuation
allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of
the  deferred  tax  assets  will  be  realized.  Deferred  tax  liabilities  generally  represent  tax  expense  recognized  in  our  consolidated
financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax
return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.

In 2021, our annual tax rate was 21.8% compared to 20.9% in 2020. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information.

See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Pension and Retiree Medical Plans

Our  pension  plans  cover  certain  employees  in  the  United  States  and  certain  international  employees.  Benefits  are  determined
based  on  either  years  of  service  or  a  combination  of  years  of  service  and  earnings.  Certain  U.S.  and  Canada  retirees  are  also
eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share
of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing
the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.

See  “Items  Affecting  Comparability”  and  Note  7  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  information  about  changes  and
settlements within our pension plans.

Our Assumptions

The  determination  of  pension  and  retiree  medical  expenses  and  obligations  requires  the  use  of  assumptions  to  estimate  the
amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree
medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working
during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and
(3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on
assets for our funded plans.

Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:

•

•

•

•

•

certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;

the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans;

the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities;

for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and

for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates.

56

Table of Contents

Certain  assumptions  reflect  our  historical  experience  and  management’s  best  judgment  regarding  future  expectations.  All
actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a
curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact
on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.

At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with
maturities  comparable  to  those  of  our  liabilities.  Our  U.S.  obligation  and  pension  and  retiree  medical  expense  is  based  on  the
discount  rates  determined  using  the  Mercer  Above  Mean  Curve.  This  curve  includes  bonds  that  closely  match  the  timing  and
amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.

See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’
investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given
year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.

The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is
based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care
industry.  Our  review  of  the  trend  rate  considers  factors  such  as  demographics,  plan  design,  new  medical  technologies  and
changes in medical carriers.

Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:

Pension

Service cost discount rate
Interest cost discount rate
Expected rate of return on plan assets
Expected rate of salary increases

Retiree medical

Service cost discount rate
Interest cost discount rate
Expected rate of return on plan assets

Based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2022 primarily reflecting plan
changes and related impacts, and higher discount rates.

Sensitivity of Assumptions

A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our
benefit  plans.  A  25-basis-point  decrease  in  each  of  the  above  discount  rates  and  expected  rate  of  return  assumptions  would
individually increase 2022 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:

Funding

We  make  contributions  to  pension  trusts  that  provide  plan  benefits  for  certain  pension  plans.  These  contributions  are  made  in
accordance  with  applicable  tax  regulations  that  provide  for  current  tax  deductions  for  our  contributions  and  taxation  to  the
employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be
currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these
plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these
benefits.

We  made  discretionary  contributions  to  our  U.S.  qualified  defined  benefit  plans  of  $75  million  in  January  2022  and  expect  to
make an additional $75 million contribution in the third quarter of 2022.

Our pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest
rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We continue to monitor the
impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  related  global  economic  conditions  and  uncertainty  on  the  net  unfunded  status  of  our
pension and retiree medical plans. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our
pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and
estimated future benefit payments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions

Basis of Presentation

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and  include  the
consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain
other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence
over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control
these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions
are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan
subsidiaries.  As  such,  our  Venezuelan  subsidiaries  are  not  included  within  our  consolidated  financial  results  for  any  period
presented.

Raw  materials,  direct  labor  and  plant  overhead,  as  well  as  purchasing  and  receiving  costs,  costs  directly  related  to  production
planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and
delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financial  statements  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  reported
amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  expenses  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities.  Estimates  are  used  in
determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical
accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-
lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical
experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and
adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the
COVID-19  pandemic  has  made  such  estimates  and  assumptions  more  difficult  to  calculate.  As  future  events  and  their  effect
cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53  reporting week every five or six years, including in
our  2022  financial  results.  While  our  North  America  results  are  reported  on  a  weekly  calendar  basis,  substantially  all  of  our
international  operations  reported  on  a  monthly  calendar  basis  prior  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  and  beginning  in  the  fourth
quarter of 2021, all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact
on  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  following  chart  details  our  quarterly  reporting  schedule  for  the  three  years
presented:

amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to
the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

Our Divisions

We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:

1) FLNA, which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada;
2) QFNA, which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the

United States and Canada;

3) PBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;
4) LatAm, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America;
5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe;
6) AMESA, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia;

and

7) APAC, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand,

our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa.

The  accounting  policies  for  the  divisions  are  the  same  as  those  described  in  Note  2,  except  for  the  following  allocation
methodologies:

•
•
•

share-based compensation expense;
pension and retiree medical expense; and
derivatives.

Our  divisions  are  held  accountable  for  share-based  compensation  expense  and,  therefore,  this  expense  is  allocated  to  our
divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.

The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:

The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market
conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual
expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.

Pension and Retiree Medical Expense

Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between
the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7
is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.

Derivatives

We  centrally  manage  commodity  derivatives  on  behalf  of  our  divisions.  These  commodity  derivatives  include  agricultural
products,  energy  and  metals.  Commodity  derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  treatment  are  marked  to  market
each  period  with  the  resulting  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  corporate  unallocated  expenses  as  either  cost  of  sales  or  selling,
general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected
in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions
realize  the  economic  effects  of  the  derivative  without  experiencing  any  resulting  mark-to-market  volatility,  which  remains  in
corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading
or speculative purposes.

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

We  recognize  revenue  when  our  performance  obligation  is  satisfied.  Our  primary  performance  obligation  (the  distribution  and
sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is
also  when  control  is  transferred.  Merchandising  activities  are  performed  after  a  customer  obtains  control  of  the  product,  are
accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses.  Merchandising  activities  are  immaterial  in  the  context  of  our  contracts.  In  addition,  we
exclude  from  net  revenue  all  sales,  use,  value-added  and  certain  excise  taxes  assessed  by  government  authorities  on  revenue
producing transactions.

The  transfer  of  control  of  products  to  our  customers  is  typically  based  on  written  sales  terms  that  do  not  allow  for  a  right  of
return.  However,  our  policy  for  DSD,  including  certain  chilled  products,  is  to  remove  and  replace  damaged  and  out-of-date
products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy
for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based
on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.

Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry
practices,  typically  require  payment  within  30  days  of  delivery  in  the  United  States,  and  generally  within  30  to  90  days
internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.

We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility,
write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the
expected  impact  of  the  global  economic  uncertainty  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic),  leveraging  estimates  of
creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.

We  are  exposed  to  concentration  of  credit  risk  from  our  major  customers,  including  Walmart.  We  have  not  experienced  credit
issues with these customers. In 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately 13% of our
consolidated  net  revenue,  including  concentrate  sales  to  our  independent  bottlers,  which  were  used  in  finished  goods  sold  by
them to Walmart.

Total Marketplace Spending

We  offer  sales  incentives  and  discounts  through  various  programs  to  customers  and  consumers.  Total  marketplace  spending
includes  sales  incentives,  discounts,  advertising  and  other  marketing  activities.  Sales  incentives  and  discounts  are  primarily
accounted  for  as  a  reduction  of  revenue  and  include  payments  to  customers  for  performing  activities  on  our  behalf,  such  as
payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote
lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of
advertising and other marketing activities.

A  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume  rebates,  are  based  on
annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur
after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar
programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance

70

Table of Contents

levels.  Differences  between  estimated  expense  and  actual  incentive  costs  are  normally  insignificant  and  are  recognized  in
earnings  in  the  period  such  differences  are  determined.  In  addition,  certain  advertising  and  marketing  costs  are  also  based  on
annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.

The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term
estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers
under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue,
and the remaining balances of $262 million as of December 25, 2021 and $299 million as of December 26, 2020 are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.

For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our
interim  reporting  periods  in  the  same  year  that  benefits  from  the  programs.  The  allocation  methodology  is  based  on  our
forecasted  sales  incentives  for  the  full  year  and  the  proportion  of  each  interim  period’s  actual  gross  revenue  or  volume,  as
applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim
period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that
they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising
and  other  marketing  activities.  Our  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  are  not  impacted  by  this  interim  allocation
methodology.

Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $5.1 billion in 2021,
$4.6 billion in 2020 and $4.7 billion in 2019, including advertising expenses of $3.5 billion in 2021 and $3.0 billion in both 2020
and 2019. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:

• media and personal service prepayments;

•

•

promotional materials in inventory; and

production costs of future media advertising.

Deferred advertising costs of $53 million and $48 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, are
classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.

Distribution Costs

Distribution  costs,  including  the  costs  of  shipping  and  handling  activities,  which  include  certain  merchandising  activities,  are
reported  as  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Shipping  and  handling  expenses  were  $13.7  billion  in  2021,  $11.9
billion in 2020 and $10.9 billion in 2019.

Software Costs

We  capitalize  certain  computer  software  and  software  development  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  developing  or  obtaining
computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will
be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or
obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software
projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included
in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the
estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $135 million in 2021,
$152  million  in  2020  and  $166  million  in  2019.  Net  capitalized  software  and  development  costs  were  $809  million  and  $664
million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively.

71

Table of Contents

Commitments and Contingencies

We  are  subject  to  various  claims  and  contingencies  related  to  lawsuits,  certain  taxes  and  environmental  matters,  as  well  as
commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments
when a loss is probable and estimable.

Research and Development

We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation
globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research
and development costs were $752 million, $719 million and $711 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reported
within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually,
using  either  a  qualitative  or  quantitative  approach.  We  perform  this  annual  assessment  during  our  third  quarter,  or  more
frequently  if  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  not  be  recoverable.  Where  we  use  the  qualitative  assessment,
first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include
macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory
environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment
indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.

In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair
value  of  the  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  and  the  reporting  unit,  respectively.  Estimated  fair  value  is  determined  using
discounted  cash  flows  and  requires  an  analysis  of  several  estimates  including  future  cash  flows  or  income  consistent  with
management’s  strategic  business  plans,  annual  sales  growth  rates,  perpetuity  growth  assumptions  and  the  selection  of
assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant
management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including
those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used
in  our  impairment  evaluations  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  goodwill,  such  as  forecasted  growth  rates  (including
perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are
consistent  with  our  internal  forecasts  and  operating  plans.  A  deterioration  in  these  assumptions  could  adversely  impact  our
results.

Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment.  If  an  evaluation  of  the  undiscounted  future  cash  flows  indicates  impairment,  the  asset  is  written  down  to  its
estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

See Note 4 for further information.

• Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans – Note 7.
• Financial Instruments – Note 9.
• Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
•

Inventories –  Note  14.  Inventories  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value.  Cost  is  determined  using  the
average; first-in, first-out (FIFO); or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods.

• Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  –  Note  14.  Property,  plant  and  equipment  is  recorded  at  historical  cost.  Depreciation  is
recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Construction in progress is not depreciated until
ready for service.
Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and
expenses.  Adjustments  resulting  from  translating  net  assets  are  reported  as  a  separate  component  of  accumulated  other
comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted

In  2019,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  guidance  to  simplify  the  accounting  for  income  taxes.  The
guidance  primarily  addresses  how  to  (1)  recognize  a  deferred  tax  liability  after  we  transition  to  or  from  the  equity  method  of
accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction,
(3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate,
and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on
income for hybrid tax regimes. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges

2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

The  2019  Productivity  Plan,  publicly  announced  on  February  15,  2019,  will  leverage  new  technology  and  business  models  to
further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying
the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.
To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the plan through the
end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. We now expect to incur pre-tax
charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous
estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. These
pre-tax  charges  are  expected  to  consist  of  approximately  55%  of  severance  and  other  employee-related  costs,  10%  for  asset
impairments  (all  non-cash)  resulting  from  plant  closures  and  related  actions  and  35%  for  other  costs  associated  with  the
implementation of our initiatives.

The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 25, 2021 is expected to be paid by the end of 2022.

Other Productivity Initiatives

There were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity
Plan.

We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above.

Amortization  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  an  intangible  asset’s  estimated  useful  life.  Amortization  of  intangible
assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 25, 2021 and using average 2021 foreign
exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:

Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic
environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written
down  to  its  estimated  fair  value,  which  is  based  on  discounted  future  cash  flows.  Useful  lives  are  periodically  evaluated  to
determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020
and  December  28,  2019.  We  did  not  recognize  any  impairment  charges  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  year  ended
December  25,  2021.  In  2020,  we  recognized  a  pre-tax  impairment  charge  of  $41  million  related  to  a  coconut  water  brand  in
PBNA.  We  did  not  recognize  any  material  impairment  charges  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  year  ended
December 28, 2019. As of December 25, 2021, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise
rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA’s
reacquired  and  acquired  franchise  rights  if  future  revenues  and  their  contribution  to  the  operating  results  of  PBNA’s  CSD
business  do  not  achieve  our  expected  future  cash  flows  or  if  macroeconomic  conditions  result  in  a  future  increase  in  the
weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.

We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived
intangible  assets  in  Russia  and  have  concluded  that  there  are  no  impairments  for  the  year  ended  December  25,  2021.  The
estimated  fair  value  of  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  is  dependent  on  macroeconomic  conditions  (including  a  resulting
increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value), future revenues and their contributions to operating
results  and  expected  future  cash  flows  (including  perpetuity  growth  assumptions),  and  significant  changes  in  the  decisions
regarding  assets  that  do  not  perform  consistent  with  our  expectations.  Subsequent  to  December  25,  2021,  we  discontinued  or
repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe segment. As a result, we will recognize pre-tax impairment
charges of approximately $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 in selling, general and administrative expenses.

For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.

In 2021, we recorded $190 million ($0.14 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of adjustments related to
the final assessment of the 2014 through 2016 IRS audit. There were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act.
In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ($0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act.

As of December 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the
provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $309 million
in 2021, $78 million in 2020 and $663 million in 2019. We currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in
2022.

The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax
income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election

Other Tax Matters

In 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both
agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals
conference.  As  a  result  of  the  analysis  of  the  2014  through  2016  final  assessment,  we  remeasured  all  applicable  reserves  for
uncertain  tax  positions  for  all  years  open  under  the  statute  of  limitations,  including  any  correlating  adjustments  impacting  the
mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $112 million in 2021.

On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF),
effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During
2021, no income tax adjustments related to the TRAF were recorded. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million
related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019, we recorded a net tax expense of $24 million
related  to  the  impact  of  the  TRAF.  While  the  accounting  for  the  impacts  of  the  TRAF  are  deemed  to  be  complete,  further
adjustments  to  our  financial  statements  and  related  disclosures  could  be  made  in  future  quarters,  including  in  connection  with
final tax return filings.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following:

Our  annual  tax  rate  is  based  on  our  income,  statutory  tax  rates  and  tax  planning  strategies  and  transactions,  including  transfer
pricing  arrangements,  available  to  us  in  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in
determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax
return  positions  are  fully  supportable,  we  believe  that  certain  positions  are  subject  to  challenge  and  that  we  likely  will  not
succeed.  We  adjust  these  reserves,  as  well  as  the  related  interest,  in  light  of  changing  facts  and  circumstances,  such  as  the
progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would
usually  require  the  use  of  cash.  Favorable  resolution  would  be  recognized  as  a  reduction  to  our  annual  tax  rate  in  the  year  of
resolution.

As of December 25, 2021, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1.9 billion. We
accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $326 million
as  of  December  25,  2021,  of  which  $3  million  of  tax  benefit  was  recognized  in  2021.  The  gross  amount  of  interest  accrued,
reported in other liabilities, was $338 million as of December 26, 2020, of which $93 million of tax expense was recognized in
2020.

Operating loss carryforwards totaling $30.0 billion as of December 25, 2021 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and
state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These
operating losses will expire as follows: $0.3 billion in 2022, $26.8 billion between 2023 and 2041 and $2.9 billion may be carried
forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Undistributed International Earnings

As  of  December  25,  2021,  we  had  approximately  $7  billion  of  undistributed  international  earnings.  We  intend  to  continue  to
reinvest $7 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings
would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange
gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount
of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.

Note 6 — Share-Based Compensation

Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with
the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under
the  shareholder-approved  PepsiCo,  Inc.  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  (LTIP).  Executives  who  are  awarded  long-term  incentives
based  on  their  performance  may  generally  elect  to  receive  their  grant  in  the  form  of  stock  options  or  RSUs,  or  a  combination
thereof.  Executives  who  elect  stock  options  receive  four  stock  options  for  every  one  RSU  that  would  have  otherwise  been
granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-
term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.

The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options
and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.

As of December 25, 2021, 44 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.

As  of  December  25,  2021,  there  was  $372  million  of  total  unrecognized  compensation  cost  related  to  nonvested  share-based
compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two
years.

Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions

The  fair  value  of  share-based  award  grants  is  amortized  to  expense  over  the  vesting  period,  primarily  three  years.  Awards  to
employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the
date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition,
we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are
expected to vest.

We  do  not  backdate,  reprice  or  grant  share-based  compensation  awards  retroactively.  Repricing  of  awards  would  require
shareholder approval under the LTIP.

Stock Options

A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee
stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense
at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date
of grant and generally have a 10-year term.

Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:

Expected life
Risk-free interest rate
Expected volatility
Expected dividend yield

2021
7 years
1.1 %
14 %
3.1 %

2020
6 years
0.9 %
14 %
3.4 %

2019
5 years
2.4 %
14 %
3.1 %

The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical
experience  with  similar  grants.  The  risk-free  interest  rate  is  based  on  the  expected  U.S.  Treasury  rate  over  the  expected  life.
Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend
yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and
stock price.

Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end
of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end
of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may
be  increased  to  the  maximum  or  reduced  to  the  minimum  threshold  based  on  the  results  of  these  performance  metrics  in
accordance  with  the  terms  established  at  the  time  of  the  award.  During  the  vesting  period,  RSUs  and  PSUs  accrue  dividend
equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.

The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant.

Note 7 — Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans

In  connection  with  our  Juice  Transaction  subsequent  to  December  25,  2021,  we  transferred  pension  and  retiree  medical
obligations of approximately $150 million and related assets to the newly formed joint venture.

In 2021, we adopted a change to the Canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective
January 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2022. After the effective
date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of
service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee
contributions up to defined limits. We also adopted a change to the U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all
participants  effective  March  31,  2022.  After  the  effective  date,  participants  will  have  the  opportunity  to  receive  employer
contributions  to  match  employee  contributions  up  to  defined  limits.  Pre-tax  pension  benefits  expense  will  decrease  after  the
effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans.

In 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from PepsiCo Employees
Retirement Plan A (Plan A) to PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I), effective January 1, 2022. The benefits offered to
the plans’ participants were unchanged. There is no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.

In 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in
Plan A of $205 million ($158 million after-tax or $0.11 per share).

In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants,
effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the
effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of
service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee
contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $70 million in 2021,
primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.

In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of
certain  participants  from  Plan  A  to  Plan  I  and  to  a  newly  created  plan,  PepsiCo  Employees  Retirement  Hourly  Plan  (Plan  H),
effective January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization facilitated a more
targeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. There was
no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reorganization.

In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan
H. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service
cost expense.

In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and
administer  future  annuity  payments  for  certain  retirees.  This  transaction  triggered  a  pre-tax  settlement  charge  in  2019  of  $220
million ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share).

Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option
of  receiving  a  one-time  lump  sum  payment  equal  to  the  present  value  of  the  participant’s  pension  benefit.  This  transaction
triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively, the group
annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement
charges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share).

Table of Contents

Gains  and  losses  resulting  from  actual  experience  differing  from  our  assumptions,  including  the  difference  between  the  actual
return  on  plan  assets  and  the  expected  return  on  plan  assets,  as  well  as  changes  in  our  assumptions,  are  determined  at  each
measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a
portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year
based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 9 years), Plan H (approximately 11 years)
and  retiree  medical  (approximately  9  years),  and  the  remaining  life  expectancy  for  participants  in  Plan  I  (approximately  27
years).

The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is
included  in  other  pension  and  retiree  medical  benefits  (expense)/income  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  average  remaining
service life for participants in both Plan A and Plan H, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the
freeze is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze, or the remaining life expectancy
for participants in Plan I.

The  net  gain  arising  in  the  current  year  is  primarily  attributable  to  the  increase  in  discount  rate  offset  by  actual  experience
differing from demographic assumptions.

The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned
by employees for working during the year.

87

Table of Contents

The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:

Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.

•
• Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will

be used to settle future benefit obligations.

• Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting

from plan amendments.

• Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets

•

•

and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
Settlement/curtailment  loss/(gain)  represents  the  result  of  actions  that  effectively  eliminate  all  or  a  portion  of  related
projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan
due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are
irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts
are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the
sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are
recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred
(when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).
Special  termination  benefits  are  the  additional  benefits  offered  to  employees  upon  departure  due  to  actions  such  as
restructuring.

The components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows:

(a) The decrease in U.S. pension plans with obligations in excess of plan assets primarily reflects employer contributions to Plan H.

Of the total projected pension benefit obligation as of December 25, 2021, approximately $810 million relates to plans that we do
not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.

(a)

Includes $500 million contribution in 2021, $325 million contribution in 2020 and $400 million contribution in 2019 to fund our qualified defined benefit plans in the
United States.

We made a discretionary contribution of $75 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in January 2022 and expect to
make  an  additional  $75  million  contribution  in  the  third  quarter  of  2022.  In  addition,  in  2022,  we  expect  to  make  non-
discretionary contributions of approximately $135 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and approximately
$55 million for retiree medical benefits.

We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net
unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility
associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.

Plan Assets

Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction
with  plan  obligations,  an  evaluation  of  market  conditions,  tolerance  for  risk  and  cash  requirements  for  benefit  payments.  This
strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are
available  to  meet  the  plans’  benefit  obligations  when  they  become  due.  Assets  contributed  to  our  pension  plans  are  no  longer
controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in
these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan
assets  in  a  well-diversified  portfolio  of  equity  and  high-quality  debt  securities  and  real  estate  to  achieve  our  long-term  return
expectations.  Our  investment  policy  also  permits  the  use  of  derivative  instruments,  such  as  futures  and  forward  contracts,  to
reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future
date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.

For  2022  and  2021,  our  expected  long-term  rate  of  return  on  U.S.  plan  assets  is  6.3%  and  6.4%,  respectively.  Our  target
investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:

Fixed income
U.S. equity
International equity
Real estate

2022
56 %
22 %
18 %
4 %

2021
51 %
24 %
21 %
4 %

Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly
review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.

The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset
class,  taking  into  account  volatility  and  correlation  among  asset  classes  and  our  historical  experience.  We  also  review  current
levels  of  interest  rates  and  inflation  to  assess  the  reasonableness  of  the  long-term  rates.  We  evaluate  our  expected  return
assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value
of assets

90

Table of Contents

for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes
investment  gains  or  losses  (the  difference  between  the  expected  and  actual  return  based  on  the  market-related  value  of  assets)
over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.

Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2021 and 2020 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both
years and are as follows:

Includes $299 million and $315 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees
and their beneficiaries.
Invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock
investments. The common and preferred stock investments are based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and
include one large-cap fund that represents 11% and 13% of total U.S. plan assets for 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(c) These  investments  are  based  on  quoted  bid  prices  for  comparable  securities  in  the  marketplace  and  broker/dealer  quotes  in  active  markets.  Corporate  bonds  of  U.S.-based

Includes Level 1 assets of $216 million and $178 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and Level 2 assets of $136 million and $100 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(f) The real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these
funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have
notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days.

Savings Plan

Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The
plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain
employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service.

Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive
an employer contribution based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.

In 2021, 2020 and 2019, our total Company contributions were $246 million, $225 million and $197 million, respectively.

As  of  December  25,  2021  and  December  26,  2020,  our  international  debt  of  $38  million  and  $29  million,  respectively,  was
related to borrowings from external parties, including various lines of credit. These lines

(a) Series A.

As a result of the cash tender offers, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $842 million ($677 million after-tax or $0.49 per share) to
net interest expense and other, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss
on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial
statements for the mark-to-market impact of treasury rate locks associated with the cash tender offers.

In 2021, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on
May 28, 2026. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in U.S.
dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed
on  a  same-day  basis,  subject  to  customary  terms  and  conditions.  We  may  request  that  commitments  under  this  agreement  be
increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year,

93

Table of Contents

request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion
five year credit agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019.

Also in 2021, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires
on May 27, 2022. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion in U.S.
dollars  and/or  euros,  subject  to  customary  terms  and  conditions.  We  may  request  that  commitments  under  this  agreement  be
increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day
period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later
than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion 364-day
credit agreement, dated as of June 1, 2020.

Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate
purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December
25, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.

In  2020,  one  of  our  international  consolidated  subsidiaries  borrowed  21.7  billion  South  African  rand,  or  approximately
$1.3  billion,  from  our  two  unsecured  bridge  loan  facilities  (Bridge  Loan  Facilities)  to  fund  our  acquisition  of  Pioneer  Foods.
These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted.

In 2021, we paid $750 million to redeem all $750 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.70% senior notes due 2021 and
terminated the associated interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million.

In 2020, we paid $1.1 billion to redeem all $1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15% senior notes due 2020 and
terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $0.8 billion.

In 2019, we paid $1.0 billion to redeem all $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due 2020.

Note 9 — Financial Instruments

Derivatives and Hedging

We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:

•
•
•

commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;
foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and
interest rates.

In  the  normal  course  of  business,  we  manage  commodity  price,  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks  through  a  variety  of
strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve
the  identification  and  effective  implementation  of  meaningful  cost-saving  opportunities  or  efficiencies,  including  the  use  of
derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include
fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.

Our  hedging  strategies  include  the  use  of  derivatives  and,  in  the  case  of  our  net  investment  hedges,  debt  instruments.  Certain
derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not
qualify  and  are  marked  to  market  through  earnings.  The  accounting  for  qualifying  hedges  allows  changes  in  a  hedging
instrument’s  fair  value  to  offset  corresponding  changes  in  the  hedged  item  in  the  same  reporting  period  that  the  hedged  item
impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other

94

Table of Contents

comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable
that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains
or losses reclassified during the year ended December 25, 2021 were not material.

Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating
activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with
the underlying hedged item.

Credit Risk

We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of
credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of
our  counterparty  credit  risk,  we  consider  this  risk  to  be  low.  In  addition,  we  enter  into  derivative  contracts  with  a  variety  of
financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.

Certain  of  our  agreements  with  our  counterparties  require  us  to  post  full  collateral  on  derivative  instruments  in  a  net  liability
position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on
credit  watch  for  possible  downgrade  or  if  our  credit  rating  falls  below  either  of  these  levels.  The  fair  value  of  all  derivative
instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 25, 2021 was $247
million.  We  have  posted  no  collateral  under  these  contracts  and  no  credit-risk-related  contingent  features  were  triggered  as  of
December 25, 2021.

Commodity Prices

We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in
the  competitive  environment  in  which  we  operate.  This  risk  is  managed  through  the  use  of  fixed-price  contracts  and  purchase
orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply
of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms
of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for
agricultural  products,  energy  and  metals.  Derivatives  used  to  hedge  commodity  price  risk  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge
accounting  treatment  are  marked  to  market  each  period  with  the  resulting  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  corporate  unallocated
expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These
gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity
in operating profit.

Our  commodity  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $1.6  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.1  billion  as  of
December 26, 2020.

Foreign Exchange

We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed
or  sold.  Additionally,  we  are  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  from  net  investments  in  foreign  subsidiaries,  foreign  currency
purchases  and  foreign  currency  assets  and  liabilities  created  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  We  manage  this  risk  through
sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of
derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign
currency  transactions  are  recognized  as  transaction  gains  or  losses  on  our  income  statement  as  incurred.  We  also  use  net
investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

95

Table of Contents

Our  foreign  currency  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.8  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $1.9  billion  as  of
December 26, 2020. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of
December  25,  2021  and  $2.7  billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  For  foreign  currency  derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge
accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact
on earnings.

Interest Rates

We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and
overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps,
cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange
risk.  These  instruments  effectively  change  the  interest  rate  and  currency  of  specific  debt  issuances.  Certain  of  our  fixed  rate
indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate
and  cross-currency  interest  rate  swaps  match  the  principal,  interest  payment  and  maturity  date  of  the  related  debt.  Our  cross-
currency  interest  rate  swaps  have  terms  of  no  more  than  twelve  years.  Our  Treasury  locks  and  swap  locks  are  entered  into  to
protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.

Our  interest  rate  derivatives  had  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.1  billion  as  of  December  25,  2021  and  $3.0  billion  as  of
December 26, 2020.

As of December 25, 2021, approximately 2% of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 3%, after the
impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of December 26, 2020.

Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities

Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
Highly  liquid  debt  securities  with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  are  recorded  as  cash  equivalents.  Our  held-to-
maturity  debt  securities  consist  of  U.S.  Treasury  securities  and  commercial  paper.  As  of  December  25,  2021,  we  had  no
investments in U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 26, 2020, we had $2.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities
with $2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $0.1 billion in short-term investments. As of December 25, 2021, we
had $130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 26, 2020, we had
$260 million of investments in commercial paper with $75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $185 million in
short-term  investments.  Held-to-maturity  debt  securities  are  recorded  at  amortized  cost,  which  approximates  fair  value,  and
realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of December 25, 2021 and
December 26, 2020, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.

(a) Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current

assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.

(b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred

compensation liability.

(c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock.
(d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections.
(e)

In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar, we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate
all  remaining  payments,  with  estimated  maximum  payments  of  approximately  $1.1  billion,  using  current  tax  rates.  The  fair  value  of  the  liability  is  estimated  using
probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we exercised our option to accelerate all remaining payments. The
change in the contingent consideration in 2021 is comprised of the fourth quarter payment of $773 million, a recognized pre-tax gain of $86 million ($66 million after-
tax  or  $0.05  per  share),  recorded  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses,  and  a  fair  value  decrease  of  $2  million,  recorded  in  goodwill  as  a  result  of  the
finalization of purchase price allocation.

(f) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of December 25, 2021, we had no hedged fixed-rate debt. As of December 26, 2020, the carrying amount of
hedged  fixed-rate  debt  was  $0.2  billion  and  classified  on  our  balance  sheet  within  short-term  debt  obligations.  As  of  December  25,  2021,  there  were  no  fair  value
hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt. As of December 26, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a
$2 million gain. As of December 25, 2021, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $2 million net loss, which is being
amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations.

(g) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates.
(h) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements.
(i) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements
which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability
positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table as of December 25, 2021.

97

Table of Contents

The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair
value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as
of  December  25,  2021  and  December  26,  2020  was  $43  billion  and  $50  billion,  respectively,  based  upon  prices  of  similar
instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

(a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from
treasury rate locks, with a total notional value of $3.2 billion, to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers and are included in net interest expense and
other. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling,
general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity.

(b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps are included
in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses,
depending on the underlying commodity.

Based  on  current  market  conditions,  we  expect  to  reclassify  net  gains  of  $176  million  related  to  our  cash  flow  hedges  from
accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months.

We  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  a  lease  at  inception.  We  have  operating  leases  for  plants,  warehouses,  distribution
centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally
have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and
some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year. We consider these options in determining the lease term
used  to  establish  our  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities.  Our  lease  agreements  do  not  contain  any  material  residual  value
guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available
at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

We  have  lease  agreements  that  contain  both  lease  and  non-lease  components.  For  real  estate  leases,  we  account  for  lease
components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).

Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures

2020 Acquisitions

On March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa
with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred
was approximately $1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international
consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020.

In  connection  with  our  acquisition  of  Pioneer  Foods,  we  have  made  certain  commitments  to  the  South  Africa  Competition
Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 8.8 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.5 billion
as  of  the  acquisition  date,  in  value  for  the  benefit  of  our  employees,  agricultural  development,  education,  developing  Pioneer
Foods’  operations  and  enterprise  development  programs  in  South  Africa.  Included  in  this  commitment  is  2.3  billion  South
African rand, or approximately $0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural,
entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily in the year ended December 26, 2020 and was primarily settled
in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining commitment of 6.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.4 billion as of
the acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-
year period from the acquisition date.

On  April  24,  2020,  we  acquired  Rockstar,  an  energy  drink  maker  with  whom  we  had  a  distribution  agreement  prior  to  the
acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future
tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $0.88 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we exercised our option
to  accelerate  all  remaining  payments  due  under  the  contingent  consideration  arrangement.  See  Note  9  for  further  information
about the contingent consideration.

On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online convenient food companies
in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $0.7 billion.

We accounted for the 2020 transactions as business combinations. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for each
of the 2020 acquisitions were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed  in  the  acquisitions  of  Pioneer  Foods,  Rockstar  and  Be  &  Cheery  and  the  resulting  goodwill  as  of  the  respective
acquisition dates is summarized as follows:

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the
net assets recognized.

The  goodwill  recorded  as  part  of  the  acquisition  of  Pioneer  Foods  primarily  reflects  synergies  expected  to  arise  from  our
combined brand portfolios and distribution networks, and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the
AMESA segment.

The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Rockstar primarily represents the value of PepsiCo’s expected new innovation
in the energy category and is deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the PBNA segment.

The  goodwill  recorded  as  part  of  the  acquisition  of  Be  &  Cheery  primarily  reflects  growth  opportunities  for  PepsiCo  as  we
leverage  Be  &  Cheery’s  direct-to-consumer  and  supply  chain  capabilities  and  is  not  deductible  for  tax  purposes.  All  of  the
goodwill is recorded in the APAC segment.

Juice Transaction

In  the  first  quarter  of  2022,  we  sold  our  Tropicana,  Naked  and  other  select  juice  brands  to  PAI  Partners  for  approximately
$3.5 billion in cash and a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America and
Europe.  The  North  America  portion  of  the  transaction  was  completed  on  January  24,  2022  and  the  Europe  portion  of  the
transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s
portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. In connection with the sale, we
entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we will provide certain services to the joint venture to
help  facilitate  an  orderly  transition  of  the  business  following  the  sale.  In  return  for  these  services,  the  new  joint  venture  is
required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our actual costs without markup. Subsequent to the transaction close
date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to
targeted  amounts  set  forth  in  the  purchase  agreement.  We  expect  to  record  a  pre-tax  gain  of  approximately  $3  billion  in  our
PBNA and Europe segments in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of this transaction.

We have reclassified $1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $0.5 billion, goodwill and other
intangible assets of $0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of

104

Table of Contents

$0.5  billion,  and  liabilities  of  $0.8  billion,  primarily  accounts  payable  and  other  liabilities  of  $0.6  billion  and  deferred  income
taxes of $0.2 billion, related to the Juice Transaction as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2021.

The Juice Transaction does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
PepsiCo, Inc.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  of  PepsiCo,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  (the  Company)  as  of
December  25,  2021  and  December  26,  2020,  the  related  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income,  Comprehensive  Income,  Cash
Flows,  and  Equity  for  each  of  the  fiscal  years  in  the  three-year  period  ended  December  25,  2021,  and  the  related  notes
(collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as  of  December  25,  2021,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the  fiscal  years  in  the  three-year  period  ended  December  25,  2021,  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  Also  in  our  opinion,  the  Company  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over  financial
reporting as of December 25, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an
opinion  on  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements  and  an  opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,
whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all  material
respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,
projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The  critical  audit  matters  communicated  below  are  matters  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial
statements  that  were  communicated  or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relate  to  accounts  or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex  judgments.  The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  consolidated
financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Sales incentive accruals

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through
various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the
need  to  accrue  for  the  expected  liability.  These  incentives  are  accrued  for  in  the  “Accounts  payable  and  other  current
liabilities”  line  on  the  balance  sheet.  These  accruals  are  based  on  sales  incentive  agreements,  expectations  regarding
customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.

We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and
complex  auditor  judgment  is  required  in  evaluating  these  sales  incentive  accruals  as  a  result  of  the  timing  difference
between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer
and  consumer  participation  and  performance  level  assumptions  underlying  the  accrual,  and  (2)  the  impact  of  historical
experience and trends.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and
tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related
to (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance
levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical
periods.  To  evaluate  the  timing  and  amount  of  certain  accrued  sales  incentives  we  (1)  analyzed  the  accrual  by  sales
incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2)
recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis,

109

Table of Contents

based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales
incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements
or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.

Carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands

As  discussed  in  Notes  2  and  4  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  performs  impairment  testing  of  its
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and
changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value
of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 25, 2021 was $35.5 billion which represents 38% of total assets, and
includes PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value
of $8.6 billion as of December 25, 2021.

We  identified  the  assessment  of  the  carrying  value  of  PBNA’s  reacquired  and  acquired  franchise  rights  and  certain  of
Europe’s juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the
impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The
impairment  analysis  of  these  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  requires  significant  auditor  judgment  to  evaluate  the
Company’s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of
the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and
tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  certain  internal  controls  related  to  the  indefinite-lived  assets  impairment  process,
including  controls  related  to  the  development  of  forecasted  revenue,  profitability  levels,  and  expected  long-term  growth
rates  and  select  the  discount  rates  to  be  applied  to  the  projected  cash  flows.  We  also  evaluated  the  sensitivity  of  the
Company’s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods.
To assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual
results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other
internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating
(1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to
the  respective  assets,  including  projected  long-term  nominal  Gross  Domestic  Product  growth  in  the  respective  local
countries,  and  (2)  the  discount  rates  used  in  the  impairment  tests  by  comparing  them  against  discount  rates  that  were
independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.

Unrecognized tax benefits

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income
tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 25, 2021, the
Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes
that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though
the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well
as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court
rulings or tax authority settlements.

We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the
application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is

110

Table of Contents

complex  and  involves  subjective  judgment.  Such  judgments  impact  both  the  timing  and  amount  of  the  reserves  that  are
recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new
information.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and
tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  certain  internal  controls  related  to  the  unrecognized  tax  benefits  process,  including
controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to
estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing
unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax
and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits
by (1) evaluating the Company’s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing
the  Company’s  interpretation  of  existing  tax  law  as  well  as  new  and  amended  tax  laws,  tax  positions  taken,  associated
external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our
Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or
submit  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  (1)  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b)  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting.  Our  management  is  responsible  for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief  Financial  Officer,  we  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based
upon criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  that  evaluation,  our  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial
reporting was effective as of December 25, 2021.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has
issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During our fourth quarter of 2021, we continued migrating certain of
our  financial  processing  systems  to  an  ERP  solution.  These  systems  implementations  are  part  of  our  ongoing  global  business
transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases
over  the  next  several  years.  In  connection  with  these  ERP  implementations,  we  are  updating  and  will  continue  to  update  our
internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting
procedures. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing into the first quarter of 2022, we began implementing these
systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations
did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In
addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our
operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this

114

Table of Contents

multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  processes,  to  maintain  effective  controls  over  our  financial  reporting.  These  business
process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting
as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK

The  following  description  of  our  common  stock  is  based  upon  our  Amended  and  Restated  Articles  of  Incorporation,

effective as of May 1, 2019 (“Articles of Incorporation”), our By-Laws, as amended and restated, effective as of April 15, 2020

(“By-Laws”)  and  applicable  provisions  of  law.  We  have  summarized  certain  portions  of  the  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  By-

Laws below. The summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are incorporated by reference as exhibits

to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part. You should read the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for

the provisions that are important to you.

General

Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two-thirds

cents (1-2/3 cents) per share. As of February 3, 2022, there

were 1,383,451,400 shares of common stock outstanding which were held of record by 101,778 shareholders.

Voting Rights. Each holder of a share of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the

applicable record date on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Action on a matter generally requires that the votes

cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast in opposition. A plurality vote is required in an election of the Board of Directors

where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.

Dividend Rights. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by

PepsiCo’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor.

Rights Upon Liquidation. Holders of our common stock are entitled to share pro rata, upon any liquidation, dissolution or

winding up of PepsiCo, in all remaining assets available for distribution to shareholders after payment or providing for PepsiCo’s

liabilities.

Preemptive  Rights.  Holders  of  our  common  stock  do  not  have  the  right  to  subscribe  for,  purchase  or  receive  new  or

additional common stock or other securities.

Transfer Agent and Registrar

Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.

Stock Exchange Listing

The  Nasdaq  Global  Select  Market  is  the  principal  market  for  our  common  stock,  where  it  is  listed  under  the  symbol

“PEP,” and our common stock is also listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.

Certain Provisions of PepsiCo’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws; Director Indemnification Agreements

Advance  Notice  of  Proposals  and  Nominations.  Our  By-Laws  provide  that  shareholders  must  provide  timely  written

notice to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual

meeting of shareholders. Notice for

2

an annual meeting is generally timely if it is received at our principal office not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to

the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than

30 days or delayed more than 60 days from this anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, such

notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close

of  business  on  the  later  of  the  90th  day  prior  to  such  annual  meeting  or  the  tenth  day  following  the  day  on  which  public

announcement  of  the  date  of  such  annual  meeting  was  first  made.  Shareholders  utilizing  “proxy  access”  must  meet  separate

deadlines. The By-Laws also specify the form and content of a shareholder’s notice. These provisions may prevent shareholders

from  bringing  matters  before  an  annual  meeting  of  shareholders  or  from  nominating  candidates  for  election  as  directors  at  an

annual meeting of shareholders.

Proxy Access. Our By-Laws contain “proxy access” provisions which give an eligible shareholder (or a group of up to 20

shareholders  aggregating  their  shares)  that  has  owned  3%  or  more  of  the  outstanding  common  stock  continuously  for  at  least

three years the right to nominate the greater of two nominees and 20% of the number of directors to be elected at the applicable

annual general meeting, and to have those nominees included in our proxy materials, subject to the other terms and conditions of

our By-Laws.

Special Meetings. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by resolution of the

Board or by our corporate secretary upon written request of one or more shareholders holding shares of record representing at

least 20% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Any such special meeting called at

the request of our shareholders will be held at such date, time and place (if any) as may be fixed by our Board, provided that the

date of such special meeting may not be more than 90 days from the receipt of such request by the corporate secretary. The By-

Laws specify the form and content of a shareholder’s request for a special meeting.

Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees. Our By-Laws provide that unless the Board determines otherwise,

we shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an

action, suit or proceeding (including appeals), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative, by reason of the

fact that such person, such person’s testator or intestate, is or was one of our directors, officers or employees, or is or was serving

at our request as a director, officer or employee of

3

another  enterprise,  against  expenses  (including  attorneys’  fees),  judgments,  fines  and  amounts  paid  in  settlement  actually  and

reasonably  incurred  by  such  person  in  connection  with  such  action,  suit  or  proceeding.  Pursuant  to  our  By-Laws  this

indemnification may, at the Board’s discretion, also include advancement of expenses prior to the final disposition of such action,

suit or proceeding.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our independent directors, pursuant to which

we have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each director against any and all liabilities

and assessments (including attorneys’ fees and other costs, expenses and obligations) arising out of or related to any threatened,

pending  or  completed  action,  suit,  proceeding,  inquiry  or  investigation,  whether  civil,  criminal,  administrative,  or  other,

including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (whether with or without court approval),

and  any  interest,  assessments,  excise  taxes  or  other  charges  paid  or  payable  in  connection  with  or  in  respect  of  any  of  the

foregoing, incurred by the independent director and arising out of his status as a director or member of a committee of our Board,

or  by  reason  of  anything  done  or  not  done  by  the  director  in  such  capacities.  After  receipt  of  an  appropriate  request  by  an

independent director, we will also advance all expenses, costs and other obligations (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or

related  to  such  matters.  We  will  not  be  liable  for  payment  of  any  liability  or  expense  incurred  by  an  independent  director  on

account of acts which, at the time taken, were known or believed by such director to be clearly in conflict with our best interests.

Certain Anti-Takeover Effects of North Carolina Law

The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act generally requires the affirmative vote of 95% of a public corporation’s

voting shares to approve a “business combination” with any entity that a majority of continuing directors determines beneficially

owns, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the voting shares of the corporation (or ever owned, directly or indirectly, more

than 20% and is still an “affiliate” of the corporation) unless the fair price provisions and the procedural provisions of the North

Carolina Shareholder Protection Act are satisfied.

“Business combination” is defined by the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act as (i) any merger, consolidation or

conversion of a corporation with or into any other entity, or (ii) any sale or lease of all or any substantial part of the corporation’s

assets to any other entity, or (iii) any payment, sale or lease to the corporation or any subsidiary thereof in exchange for

4

securities of the corporation of any assets having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than $5,000,000 of any other

The  North  Carolina  Shareholder  Protection  Act  contains  provisions  that  allowed  a  corporation  to  “opt  out”  of  the

applicability of the  North  Carolina  Shareholder  Protection  Act’s  voting  provisions within specified time periods that generally

have expired. The Act applies to PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods.

This  statute  could  discourage  a  third  party  from  making  a  partial  tender  offer  or  otherwise  attempting  to  obtain  a

substantial position in our equity securities or seeking to obtain control of us. It also might limit the price that certain investors

might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change

of control of us.

The notes were issued under an indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon, as

trustee  (the  “indenture”).  Below  we  have  summarized  certain  terms  and  provisions  of  the  indenture.  The  summary  is  not

complete.  The  indenture  has  been  incorporated  by  reference  as  an  exhibit  to  the  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  to  which  this

exhibit is a part. You should read the indenture for the provisions which may be important to you. The indenture is subject to and

such  series  having  the  same  terms  (except  issue  date,  date  from  which  interest  accrues  and,  in  some  cases,  the  first  interest

payment date) so that the existing notes of such series and the new notes of such series form a single series under the indenture.

As of February 3, 2022, no such additional notes have been issued.

Minimum Denominations. The sterling notes were issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples

of £1,000 in excess thereof. The euro notes were issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000

in excess thereof.

Global Notes. The notes of each series are in the form of one or more global notes that we deposited with or on behalf of a

common  depositary  for  the  accounts  of  Euroclear  Bank  S.A./N.V.,  or  its  successor,  as  operator  of  the  Euroclear  System

(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and are registered in the name of the nominee of the

common depositary.

Paying Agent.  We  have  initially  appointed  The  Bank  of  New  York  Mellon,  London  Branch  to  act  as  paying  agent  and

transfer agent in connection with the notes as well as to serve as the common depositary for the notes. The Bank of New York

Mellon,  London  Branch  is  an  affiliate  of  the  trustee.  The  term  “paying  agent”  shall  include  The  Bank  of  New  York  Mellon,

London Branch and any successors appointed from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the indenture.

Currency of Payment of Sterling Notes. The principal and interest payments in respect of the sterling notes are payable in

sterling. If the United Kingdom adopts euro, in lieu of sterling, as its lawful currency, the sterling notes will be redenominated in

euro  on  a  date  determined  by  us,  in  our  sole  discretion,  with  a  principal  amount  for  each  sterling  note  equal  to  the  principal

amount of that note in sterling, converted into euro at the rate established by the applicable law;

8

provided  that,  if  we  determine  after  consultation  with  the  paying  agent  that  the  then  current  market  practice  in  respect  of

redenomination  into  euro  of  internationally  offered  securities  is  different  from  the  provisions  specified  above,  such  provisions

will be deemed to be amended so as to comply with such market practice and we will promptly notify the trustee and the paying

agent  of  such  deemed  amendment.  We  will  give  30  days’  notice  of  the  redenomination  date  to  the  paying  agent,  the  trustee,

Euroclear and Clearstream.

If sterling or, in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro, euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of

exchange  controls  or  other  circumstances  beyond  our  control  (other  than,  with  respect  to  sterling,  due  to  the  circumstances

described in the preceding paragraph but including the dissolution of the euro, if applicable), then all payments in respect of the

sterling notes will be made in U.S. dollars until sterling or euro, as the case may be, is again available to us. The amount payable

on any date in sterling or, in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro, euro will be converted to U.S. dollars on the

basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for sterling or euro, as the case may be, as determined by us in our

sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the sterling notes so made in euro or U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default

under the sterling notes or the indenture governing the sterling notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall be responsible

for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations.

Currency of Payment of Euro Notes. The principal and interest payments in respect of the euro notes, including payments

made  upon  any  redemption  of  any  series  of  the  euro  notes,  are  payable  in  euro.  If  the  euro  is  unavailable  to  us  due  to  the

imposition  of  exchange  controls  or  other  circumstances  beyond  our  control  or  if  the  euro  is  no  longer  being  used  by  the  then

member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions

by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the euro notes will be

made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us and so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in

euro  will  be  converted  into  U.S.  dollars  on  the  basis  of  the  then  most  recently  available  market  exchange  rate  for  euro,  as

determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the euro notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an

event  of  default  under  the  euro  notes  or  the  indenture  governing  the  euro  notes.  Neither  the  trustee  nor  the  paying  agent  shall

have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.

Definition  of  Business  Day.  The  term  “business  day”  with  respect  to  the  sterling  notes  means  any  day  other  than  a

Saturday  or  Sunday  or  a  day  on  which  banking  institutions  in  the  City  of  New  York  or  the  City  of  London  are  authorized  or

required by law or executive order to close.

The term “business day” with respect to the euro notes means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a

day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or the City of London are authorized or required by law or executive

order  to  close  and  (2)  on  which  the  Trans-European  Automated  Real-time  Gross  Settlement  Express  Transfer  system  (the

TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates. If any interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date is not a

business day, then the related payment for such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption date shall be paid on the next

succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on such interest payment date, maturity date or redemption

date, as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay.

Interest Payments. Each series of notes will bear interest at the per annum rate stated in its title. Interest on the notes will

be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number

of  days  from  and  including  the  date  from  which  interest  begins  to  accrue  for  the  period  to,  but  excluding,  the  next  scheduled

interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the

International Capital Markets Association.

Optional Redemption

Sterling Notes

We have the right at our option to redeem any of the sterling notes in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time

prior to their maturity, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice mailed (or otherwise transmitted in accordance

with  the  procedures  of  the  depositary)  to  the  registered  address  of  each  holder  of  the  sterling  notes,  at  a  redemption  price

(calculated by us) equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such notes and (ii) the sum of the present values of

the Remaining Scheduled Payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption),

discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the Comparable Government

10

Bond  Rate  plus  13  basis  points  plus,  in  each  case,  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  thereon  to,  but  not  including,  the  date  of

redemption.

Definitions

“Comparable  Government  Bond  Rate”  means  the  price,  expressed  as  a  percentage  (rounded  to  three  decimal  places,

0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the sterling notes, if they were to be purchased at such

price  on  the  third  business  day  prior  to  the  date  fixed  for  redemption,  would  be  equal  to  the  gross  redemption  yield  on  such

business day of the Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable

Government  Bond  prevailing  at  11:00  a.m.  (London  time)  on  such  business  day  as  determined  by  an  independent  investment

bank selected by us.

“Comparable  Government  Bond”  means,  in  relation  to  any  Comparable  Government  Bond  Rate  calculation,  at  the

discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a United Kingdom government bond whose maturity is closest to

the maturity of the sterling notes, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion considers that such similar bond is not

in  issue,  such  other  United  Kingdom  government  bond  as  such  independent  investment  bank  may,  with  the  advice  of  three

brokers  of,  and/or  market  makers  in,  United  Kingdom  government  bonds  selected  by  us,  determine  to  be  appropriate  for

determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.

“Remaining  Scheduled  Payments”  means,  with  respect  to  each  sterling  note  to  be  redeemed,  the  remaining  scheduled

payments  of  the  principal  thereof  and  interest  thereon  that  would  be  due  after  the  related  redemption  date  but  for  such

redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such sterling note,

the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest

accrued thereon to such redemption date.

“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means, with respect to any redemption date for each series of euro notes, the price,

expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption

yield on such euro notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to the date

fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond

(as  defined  below)  on  the  basis  of  the  middle  market  price  of  the  Comparable  Government  Bond  prevailing  at  11:00  a.m.

(London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us.

15

“Comparable  Government  Bond”  means,  with  respect  to  each  series  of  euro  notes,  in  relation  to  any  Comparable

Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a German government

bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the euro notes to be redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its

discretion considers that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment

bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to

be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.

“Remaining  Scheduled  Payments”  means,  with  respect  to  each  euro  note  of  each  series  to  be  redeemed,  the  remaining

scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such

redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such euro note, the

amount  of  the  next  succeeding  scheduled  interest  payment  thereon  will  be  deemed  to  be  reduced  by  the  amount  of  interest

accrued thereon to such redemption date.

General

On and after the applicable redemption date with respect to a series of notes, interest will cease to accrue on such notes or

any portion of such notes called for redemption (unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest).

On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with the trustee or its agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of

and (unless the redemption date shall be an interest payment date) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date on the notes

to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the notes of a series are to be redeemed, the notes of such series to be redeemed

shall be selected in accordance with applicable depositary procedures. Additionally, we may at any time repurchase notes in the

open market and may hold or surrender such notes to the trustee for cancellation.

Notice  of  redemption  will  be  transmitted  at  least  30  days  (or  15  days  with  respect  to  the  2039  notes,  or  10  days  with

respect  to  the  2024  notes,  May  2028  notes,  2032  notes,  2033  notes  and  2050  notes)  but  not  more  than  60  days  before  the

applicable redemption date to each holder of notes to be redeemed. We will be responsible for calculating the redemption price of

the notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

16

Payment of Additional Amounts

We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the notes such additional

amounts as are necessary in order that the net payment by us of the principal of and interest on the notes to a holder who is not a

United  States  person  (as  defined  below),  after  withholding  or  deduction  for  any  present  or  future  tax,  assessment  or  other

governmental charge imposed by the United States or a taxing authority in the United States, will not be less than the amount

provided  in  the  notes  to  be  then  due  and  payable;  provided,  however,  that  the  foregoing  obligation  to  pay  additional  amounts

shall not apply:

the United States (or any taxing authority in the United States), or any change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding

the  application  or  interpretation  of  such  laws,  regulations  or  rulings,  which  change  or  amendment  is  announced  or  becomes

based  upon  a  written  opinion  of  independent  counsel  selected  by  us,  will  become  obligated  to  pay  additional  amounts  as

described herein under the

24

heading  “—Payment  of  Additional  Amounts”  with  respect  to  the  notes  of  any  series,  then  we  may  at  any  time  at  our  option

redeem, in whole, but not in part, the outstanding notes of such series on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice, at a

redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest on those notes to, but not

Certain Covenants

Limitation of Liens

We will not, and will not permit any of our restricted subsidiaries to, incur, suffer to exist or guarantee any debt secured

by a lien on any principal property or on any shares of stock of (or other interests in) any of our restricted subsidiaries unless we

or that first-mentioned restricted subsidiary secures or causes such restricted subsidiary to secure the notes (and any of its or such

restricted subsidiary’s other debt, at its option or such restricted subsidiary’s option, as the case may be, not subordinate to the

notes), equally and ratably with (or prior to) such secured debt, for as long as such secured debt will be so secured.

These restrictions will not, however, apply to debt secured by:

(1)    any liens existing prior to the issuance of such notes;

(2)    any lien on property of or shares of stock of (or other interests in) or debt of any entity existing at the time such

entity becomes a restricted subsidiary;

(3)        any  liens  on  property,  shares  of  stock  of  (or  other  interests  in)  or  debt  of  any  entity  (a)  existing  at  the  time  of

acquisition of such property or shares (or other interests) (including acquisition through merger or consolidation),

(b) to secure the payment of all or any part of the purchase price of such property or shares (or other interests) or

construction or improvement of such property or (c) to secure any debt incurred prior to, at the time of, or within

365 days after the later of the acquisition, the completion of construction or the commencement of full operation

of  such  property  or  within  365  days  after  the  acquisition  of  such  shares  (or  other  interests)  for  the  purpose  of

financing all or any part of the purchase price of such shares (or other interests) or construction thereon;

(4)    any liens in favor of us or any of our restricted subsidiaries;

25

(5)    any liens in favor of, or required by contracts with, governmental entities; or

(6)    any extension, renewal, or refunding of liens referred to in any of the preceding clauses (1) through (5).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we or any of our restricted subsidiaries may incur, suffer to exist or guarantee any debt

secured by a lien on any principal property or on any shares of stock of (or other interests in) any of our restricted subsidiaries if,

after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such debt does not exceed 15% of our consolidated net tangible assets.

The  indenture  does  not  restrict  the  transfer  by  us  of  a  principal  property  to  any  of  our  unrestricted  subsidiaries  or  our

ability  to  change  the  designation  of  a  subsidiary  owning  principal  property  from  a  restricted  subsidiary  to  an  unrestricted

subsidiary  and,  if  we  were  to  do  so,  any  such  unrestricted  subsidiary  would  not  be  restricted  from  incurring  secured  debt  nor

would we be required, upon such incurrence, to secure the notes equally and ratably with such secured debt.

Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets

We  may  consolidate  or  merge  with  or  into,  or  convey  or  transfer  all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets  to,  any  entity

(including, without limitation, a limited partnership or a limited liability company); provided that:

•    we will be the surviving corporation or, if not, that the successor will be a corporation that is organized and validly

existing under the laws of any state of the United States of America or the District of Columbia and will expressly

assume by a supplemental indenture our obligations under the indenture and the notes;

•        immediately  after  giving  effect  to  such  transaction,  no  event  of  default,  and  no  default  or  other  event  which,  after

notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, will have happened and be continuing; and

•    we will have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or

transfer complies with the indenture.

In the event of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, any such successor will succeed to and be

substituted for us as obligor on the notes with the same effect as if it had been named in the indenture as obligor, and we will be

released from all obligations under the indenture and under the notes.

26

as set forth on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ latest consolidated balance sheets prepared in accordance with U.S.

generally accepted accounting principles.

“Debt” means any indebtedness for borrowed money.

“Principal property” means any single manufacturing or processing plant, office building or warehouse owned or leased

by us or any of our restricted subsidiaries other than a plant, warehouse, office building or portion thereof which, in the opinion

of our Board of Directors, is not of material importance to the business conducted by us and our restricted subsidiaries taken as

an entirety.

“Restricted subsidiary” means, at any time, any subsidiary which at the time is not an unrestricted subsidiary of ours.

“Subsidiary” means any entity, at least a majority of the outstanding voting stock of which shall at the time be owned,

directly or indirectly, by us or by one or more of our subsidiaries, or both.

“Unrestricted  subsidiary”  means  any  subsidiary  of  ours  (not  at  the  time  designated  as  our  restricted  subsidiary)  (1)  the

major  part  of  whose  business  consists  of  finance,  banking,  credit,  leasing,  insurance,  financial  services  or  other  similar

operations,  or  any  combination  thereof,  (2)  substantially  all  the  assets  of  which  consist  of  the  capital  stock  of  one  or  more

Events of Default

An “Event of Default” under the notes of a given series means:

(1)    default in paying interest on the notes when it becomes due and the default continues for a period of 30 days or

more;

(2)    default in paying principal, or premium, if any, on the notes when due;

(3)    default is made in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund or analogous obligation when the same becomes due,

and such default continues for 30 days or more;

(4)    default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of PepsiCo in the indenture (other than defaults

specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) above) and the default or breach continues for a period of 90 days or more after

we receive written notice from the trustee or we and the trustee receive notice from the holders of at least 51% in

aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series;

(5)        certain  events  of  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  administration  or  similar  proceedings  with  respect  to

PepsiCo have occurred; or

(6)    any other Events of Default set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo) under the indenture

occurs with respect to the notes of any series and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of at least 51% in principal amount

of the outstanding notes of that series may by written notice require us to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the

outstanding notes of that series (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes), together with all accrued

and unpaid interest and premium, if any.

If an Event of Default under the indenture specified in clause (5) with respect to PepsiCo occurs and is continuing, then

the entire principal amount of the outstanding notes (or such lesser amount as may be provided in the terms of the notes) will

automatically become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder.

28

After a declaration of acceleration, the holders of not less than 51% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes of

any  series  may  rescind  this  accelerated  payment  requirement  if  all  existing  Events  of  Default,  except  for  nonpayment  of  the

principal and interest on the notes of that series that has become due solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement,

have been cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not conflict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a

majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series also have the right to waive past defaults, except a default in

paying principal, premium or interest on any outstanding note, or in respect of a covenant or a provision that cannot be modified

or amended without the consent of all holders of the notes of that series.

Holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a series may seek to institute a proceeding only

after they have notified the trustee of a continuing Event of Default in writing and made a written request, and offered reasonable

indemnity, to the trustee to institute a proceeding and the trustee has failed to do so within 60 days after it received this notice. In

addition, within this 60 day period the trustee must not have received directions inconsistent with this written request by holders

of  a  majority  in  principal  amount  of  the  outstanding  notes  of  that  series.  These  limitations  do  not  apply,  however,  to  a  suit

instituted by a holder of a note for the enforcement of the payment of principal, interest or any premium on or after the due dates

for such payment.

During the existence of an Event of Default, the trustee is required to exercise the rights and powers vested in it under the

indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would under the circumstances in the conduct

of  that  person’s  own  affairs.  If  an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and  is  continuing,  the  trustee  is  not  under  any  obligation  to

exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders have offered to the trustee

reasonable security or indemnity. Subject to certain provisions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding

notes of any series have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to

the trustee, or exercising any trust, or power conferred on the trustee.

The  trustee  will,  within  90  days  after  any  default  occurs,  give  notice  of  the  default  to  the  holders  of  the  notes  of  that

series, unless the default was already cured or waived. Unless there is a default in paying principal, interest or any premium when

due, the trustee can withhold giving notice to the holders if it determines in good faith that the withholding of notice is in the

interest of the holders.

29

Modification and Waiver

The indenture may be amended or modified without the consent of any holder of notes in order to:

•    evidence a succession to the trustee;

•    cure ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies;

•    provide for the assumption of our obligations in the case of a merger or consolidation or transfer of all or substantially

all of our assets;

•    make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of the notes of a series;

•    add guarantors with respect to the notes of any series;

•    secure the notes of a series;

•    establish the form or forms of notes of any series;

•    maintain the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; or

•    make any change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any holder.

Other amendments and modifications of the indenture or the notes issued may be made with the consent of the holders of

not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of each series affected by the amendment or

modification. However, no modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note affected:

•    reduce the principal amount, interest or premium payable, or extend the fixed maturity, of the notes;

•    alter or waive the redemption provisions of the notes;

•    change the currency in which principal, any premium or interest is paid;

30

•    reduce the percentage in principal amount outstanding of notes of any series which must consent to an amendment,

supplement or waiver or consent to take any action;

•    impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on the notes;

•    waive a payment default with respect to the notes or any guarantor;

•    reduce the interest rate or extend the time for payment of interest on the notes;

•    adversely affect the ranking of the notes of any series; or

•    release any guarantor from any of its obligations under its guarantee or the indenture, except in compliance with the

terms of the indenture.

Satisfaction, Discharge and Covenant Defeasance

We may terminate our obligations under the indenture, when:

•    either:

•    all the notes of any series issued that have been authenticated and delivered have been delivered to the trustee

for cancellation; or

•    all the notes of any series issued that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due

and payable, will become due and payable within one year, or are to be called for redemption within one year

and  we  have  made  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the  trustee  for  the  giving  of  notice  of  redemption  by  such

trustee  in  our  name  and  at  our  expense,  and  in  each  case,  we  have  irrevocably  deposited  or  caused  to  be

deposited with the trustee sufficient funds to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the series of notes to

pay principal, interest and any premium; and

•    we have paid or caused to be paid all other sums then due and payable under the indenture; and

•        we  have  delivered  to  the  trustee  an  officers’  certificate  and  an  opinion  of  counsel,  each  stating  that  all  conditions

precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture have been complied with.

31

We may elect to have our obligations under the indenture discharged with respect to the outstanding notes of any series

(“legal  defeasance”).  Legal  defeasance  means  that  we  will  be  deemed  to  have  paid  and  discharged  the  entire  indebtedness

represented by the outstanding notes of such series under the indenture, except for:

•    the rights of holders of the notes to receive principal, interest and any premium when due;

•        our  obligations  with  respect  to  the  notes  concerning  issuing  temporary  notes,  registration  of  transfer  of  the  notes,

mutilated,  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen  notes  and  the  maintenance  of  an  office  or  agency  for  payment  for  security

payments held in trust;

•    the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee; and

•    the defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, we may elect to have our obligations released with respect to certain covenants in the indenture (“covenant

defeasance”). Any omission to comply with these obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to

the  notes  of  any  series.  In  the  event  covenant  defeasance  occurs,  certain  events,  not  including  non-payment,  bankruptcy  and

insolvency events, described under “Events of Default” above will no longer constitute an event of default for that series.

In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to outstanding notes of any series:

•    we must irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds for the purpose of making

the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to the benefit of the holders of the

notes of a series:

•    money in an amount;

•    U.S. government obligations (or equivalent government obligations in the case of notes denominated in other

than U.S. dollars or a specified currency) that will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any

payment, money in an amount; or

32

•        a  combination  of  money  and  U.S.  government  obligations  (or  equivalent  government  obligations,  as

applicable),

in  each  case  sufficient,  in  the  written  opinion  (with  respect  to  U.S.  or  equivalent  government  obligations  or  a

combination of money and U.S. or equivalent government obligations, as applicable) of a nationally recognized firm

of independent registered public accountants, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the trustee to pay

and discharge, all of the principal (including mandatory sinking fund payments), interest and any premium at the due

date or maturity;

•    in the case of legal defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that, under then

applicable federal income tax law, the holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for

federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge to be effected and will be subject to

the same federal income tax as would be the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge did not occur;

•    in the case of covenant defeasance, we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the

holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a

result  of  the  deposit  and  covenant  defeasance  to  be  effected  and  will  be  subject  to  the  same  federal  income  tax  as

would be the case if the deposit and covenant defeasance did not occur;

•    no event of default or default with respect to the outstanding notes of that series has occurred and is continuing at the

time  of  such  deposit  after  giving  effect  to  the  deposit  or,  in  the  case  of  legal  defeasance,  no  default  relating  to

bankruptcy or insolvency has occurred and is continuing at any time on or before the 91st day after the date of such

deposit, it being understood that this condition is not deemed satisfied until after the 91st day;

•    the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not cause the trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning

of the Trust Indenture Act, assuming all notes of a series were in default within the meaning of such Act;

33

•    the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under,

any other agreement or instrument to which we are a party;

•        the  legal  defeasance  or  covenant  defeasance  will  not  result  in  the  trust  arising  from  such  deposit  constituting  an

investment  company  within  the  meaning  of  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  as  amended,  unless  the  trust  is

registered under such Act or exempt from registration; and

•        we  must  have  delivered  to  the  trustee  an  officers’  certificate  and  an  opinion  of  counsel  stating  that  all  conditions

precedent with respect to the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance have been complied with.

Book-Entry, Delivery and Settlement

We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and

procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In

addition,  the  description  of  the  clearing  systems  in  this  section  reflects  our  understanding  of  the  rules  and  procedures  of

Clearstream and Euroclear as they are currently in effect. Those clearing systems could change their rules and procedures at any

time.

The notes of each series were initially represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note was

deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for

the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in

part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. You may hold your interests in the global notes in Europe

through  Clearstream  or  Euroclear,  either  as  a  participant  in  such  systems  or  indirectly  through  organizations  which  are

participants  in  such  systems.  Clearstream  and  Euroclear  will  hold  interests  in  the  global  notes  on  behalf  of  their  respective

participating  organizations  or  customers  through  customers’  securities  accounts  in  Clearstream’s  or  Euroclear’s  names  on  the

books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the notes and all transfers relating to the notes will be reflected in

the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear. The address of Clearstream is 42 Avenue JF Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg,

34

Luxembourg and the address of Euroclear is 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.

The distribution of the notes was cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear. Any secondary market trading of book-entry

interests in the notes will take place through Clearstream and Euroclear participants and will settle in same-day funds. Owners of

book-entry interests in the notes will receive payments relating to their notes in sterling with respect to the sterling notes and euro

with respect to the euro notes, except as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.

Clearstream  and  Euroclear  have  established  electronic  securities  and  payment  transfer,  processing,  depositary  and

custodial links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the notes to

be  issued,  held  and  transferred  among  the  clearing  systems  without  the  physical  transfer  of  certificates.  Special  procedures  to

facilitate clearance and settlement have been established among these clearing systems to trade securities across borders in the

secondary market.

The  policies  of  Clearstream  and  Euroclear  govern  payments,  transfers,  exchanges  and  other  matters  relating  to  the

investor’s  interest  in  the  notes  held  by  them.  We  have  no  responsibility  for  any  aspect  of  the  records  kept  by  Clearstream  or

Euroclear or any of their direct or indirect participants. We also do not supervise these systems in any way.

Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they

have made with one another or with their customers. You should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to

perform these procedures and may modify them or discontinue them at any time.

Except as provided otherwise, owners of beneficial interests in the notes will not be entitled to have the notes registered in

their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive form and will not be considered

the  owners  or  holders  of  the  notes  under  the  indenture,  including  for  purposes  of  receiving  any  reports  delivered  by  us  or  the

trustee pursuant to the indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a note must rely on the procedures of

the depositary and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its

interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of notes.

35

Certificated  Notes.  Subject  to  certain  conditions,  the  notes  represented  by  the  global  notes  are  exchangeable  for

certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples

of £1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the sterling notes and €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in

excess thereof with respect to the euro notes if:

(1)        the  common  depositary  provides  notification  that  it  is  unwilling,  unable  or  no  longer  qualified  to  continue  as

depositary for the global notes and a successor is not appointed within 90 days;

(2)    we in our discretion at any time determine not to have all the notes of any series represented by the global note; or

(3)    default entitling the holders of the applicable notes of any series to accelerate the maturity thereof has occurred and

is continuing.

Any  note  of  any  series  that  is  exchangeable  as  above  is  exchangeable  for  certificated  notes  of  such  series  issuable  in

authorized denominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a global

note  is  not  exchangeable,  except  for  a  global  note  of  the  same  aggregate  denomination  to  be  registered  in  the  name  of  the

common depositary (or its nominee).

Same-day  Payment.  Payments  (including  principal,  interest  and  any  additional  amounts)  and  transfers  with  respect  to

notes of any series in certificated form may be executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose within the City of

London (initially the office of the paying agent maintained for such purpose) or, at our option, by check mailed to the holders

thereof  at  the  respective  addresses  set  forth  in  the  register  of  holders  of  the  applicable  notes  of  such  series,  provided  that  all

payments (including principal, interest and any additional amounts) on notes in certificated form, for which the holders thereof

have given wire transfer instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts

specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient

to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with that registration may be required.

ARTICLE I – HISTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

    PepsiCo, Inc. (the “Corporation”) first established the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan effective as of September 1,
1980. The Plan at that time was comprised of the “PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Trust Indenture” and the “Plan Rules.”
The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety, effective September 2, 1982.

    The Plan was again amended and restated effective October 1, 2003, whereupon the Plan Rules became the “Plan A Rules”
(applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation’s contributions to the trust established by the PepsiCo International Retirement
Plan Trust Indenture) and the “Plan B Rules” (applicable to benefits funded by the Corporation as they arise) took effect.

    The Plan was further amended effective January 1, 2005, to provide that no person subject to taxation in the United States of
America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence, increase or in any way be enhanced, but
instead will be determined as if they had left the Corporation and any Associated Company permanently before becoming subject
to U.S. taxation.
    Effective January 1, 2010, the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form one Plan
document. The amendment and restatement referred to in the prior sentence remains in effect, and it sets forth the terms of the
“DB Program.”

    Effective January 1, 2011, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit
selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of
their home countries for whom it is judged to be impractical to have them participate in their home country retirement plans, and
employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC
Program are set forth in this document, which is the governing legal document for the DC Program. Together, the DC Program
and the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to in employee
communications as the PepsiCo International Pension Plan or “PIPP.”

    The DC Program was previously amended and restated, effective as of January 1, 2016. As part of that amendment and
restatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to also benefit selected employees: (i) who are localized to a country
outside of their home country, (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution retirement program sponsored
immediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement program is available.

    The DC Program was again amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2019. As part of that amendment and restatement,
the Corporation modified the DC Program to recognize same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners for certain purposes for
Members actively employed or on authorized leave of absence on and after January 1, 2019.

    The DC Program is hereby amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2021.

    At all times, the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that
executive’s individual employer. With respect to his employer, the executive has the rights of an unsecured general creditor. The
Plan is also intended to be exempt from ERISA as a plan maintained outside of the

1

United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.

2

ARTICLE II – DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

2.01    Definitions.

Where the following words and phrases appear in this governing document for the DC Program, they shall have the

meaning set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context:

(a) “Approved Transfer” means any of the following that are initiated or approved by the Corporation or (with the

approval of the Corporation) by a Member’s Employer –

(1) The Member’s transfer to employment based in the United States or its territories;

(2) The Member’s secondment to a work location in the United States or its territories;

(3) Any other change in the Member’s employment circumstances that will cause the Member to become a

U.S. Person.

(b) “Associated Company” means any company or undertaking which (i) is directly or indirectly controlled by or

associated in business with the Corporation, and (ii) which has agreed, subject to the ongoing consent of the Vice
President, to perform and observe the conditions, stipulations and provisions of the DC Program and to be included
among the Employers under the DC Program. “Associated Companies” means all such companies or undertakings.

(c) “Corporation” means PepsiCo, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of North

Carolina, or its successor or successors.

(d) “Dependant” means the person who shall receive the balance of a Member’s PIRP-DC Account upon the

Member’s death.

(e) “DB Program” means the portion of the Plan that provides a program of defined benefits and that is described

in the governing legal document entitled “The PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Defined Benefit Program (PIRP
DB), as it may be amended from time to time. The DB Program is also sometimes referred to as “PIRP-DB”.

(f) “DC Program” means the portion of the Plan that provides a program of defined contributions and that is

described in the governing legal document entitled “The PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Defined Contribution
Program (PIRP-DC), as it may be amended from time to time. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to as “PIRP-
DC.”

(g) “Distribution Valuation Date” means the date as specified by the Vice President from time to time as of which
PIRP-DC Accounts are valued for purposes of distributions under Article VI. Currently, the Distribution Valuation Date
for a Member is the month end that occurs just after the event specified in Article VI that triggers the Member’s
distribution. Accordingly, if the trigger event occurs on December 30 of a year, the current Distribution Valuation Date is
December 31 of that year, and if the trigger event occurs on December 31 of a year, the current Distribution Valuation
Date is

3

January 31 of the following year. The Vice President may change any current Distribution Valuation Date. Values are
determined as of the close of a Distribution Valuation Date or, if such date is not a business day, as of the close of the
preceding business day.

(h) “Effective Date” means the date as of which the DC Program is effective, January 1, 2011.

(i) “Eligible Domestic Partner” means, solely with respect to a Member who is actively employed by, or on an

Authorized Leave of Absence from, a member of the PepsiCo Organization on or after January 1, 2019, an individual who
is of the same sex or opposite sex as the Member and who satisfies paragraph (1), (2) or (3), subject to the additional rules
set forth in paragraph (4), as determined by the Vice President.

(1) Civil Union. If the Member has entered into a civil union or similar government-recognized status that
is valid at the Member’s death under the law of the location that is determined by the Vice President to
be the Member’s principal residence, the Member’s Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with
whom the Member has entered into such status, provided that such individual submits a claim for
benefits within 60 days of Member’s date of death (and if no such claim is submitted, the individual
shall not be a Domestic Partner under this Section 2.01(i)(1)).

(2) Benefits Enrollment. If the Member does not have a Domestic Partner pursuant to subsection (1)

above, the Member’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual who, on the applicable date,
was enrolled, as the Member’s domestic partner, in the Cigna International Health Program (or its
successor) sponsored by the Corporation.

(3) Other Acceptable Evidence of Partnership. If the Member does not have a Domestic Partner under
paragraph (1) or (2) above, such Member’s Domestic Partner, if any, is the individual who satisfies
such criteria of domestic partnership as the Vice President has specified in writing, provided that such
individual submits a claim for benefits within 60 days of the Member’s date of death (and if no such
claim is submitted, the individual shall not be a Domestic Partner under this Section 2.01(i)(3)).

(4) Additional Rules. The term “Eligible Domestic Partner” does not apply to a Member’s Eligible Spouse.
A Member is not permitted to have more than one Eligible Domestic Partner at any point in time, and a
Member who has an Eligible Spouse is not permitted to have an Eligible Domestic Partner.

(j) “Eligible Employee” means an individual who the Vice President has determined (i) is employed exclusively

outside of the United States on the regular staff of an Approved Employer on a full-time salaried basis, (ii) is neither
actively accruing benefits that are derived from service under the DB Program nor is designated as being eligible to
accrue such benefits, and (iii) is described in at least one of the following paragraphs

4

(1) The individual is on an assignment outside of his home country and it is judged to be impractical to
have him participate in the retirement plan(s) sponsored by the Corporation (or an Affiliated Company) in his
home country;

(2) The individual is on his second (or more) consecutive assignment outside of his home country

(effective as of January 1, 2021, the first assignment outside of his home country), and the retirement plan(s)
available to the individual in his home country do not include a retirement plan that is sponsored by the
Corporation or an Affiliated Company (e.g., a case where only a statutory plan is available to the individual);

(3) The individual is among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages

whose positions and employment terms are among those that the Vice President has determined make them
eligible to be considered for membership in the DC Program; or

(4) The individual is localized to a country outside of his home country, was actively participating in a

retirement program sponsored by a member of the PepsiCo Organization immediately prior to his localization that
will not provide for his continued active participation after his localization, and the local country employer does
not sponsor a retirement plan.

The Vice President shall have the discretion to designate as an Eligible Employee any individual employed by an
Approved Employer on a part-time basis who, but for his part-time status, otherwise satisfies the requirements of this
subsection.

(k) “Eligible Spouse” means the individual to whom the Member is married, or to whom the Member was married
on the date of his death. The determination of whether a Member is married shall be made by the Vice President based on
the law of the location that is determined by the Vice President to be the Member’s principal residence; provided,
however, that for purposes of the DC Program, a Member shall have only one Eligible Spouse.

(l) “Employers” means the Corporation and any and every Associated Company or such one or more of any of

them as the context shall determine or the circumstances require. “Employer” in relation to any person means whichever
it is of the Employers in whose employment that person is or was at the relevant time or those Employers (if more than
one) in whose employment he had been during the relevant period. An “Approved Employer” means an Employer that, as
of the time in question, has been approved by the Vice President (and remains approved) to have its Eligible Employees
become and continue as Active Members hereunder.

(m) “Entry Date” means the date as of which an Eligible Employee becomes a Member, which shall be the date

that the Vice President specifies for the Eligible Employee’s admission to Membership.

(n) “Interest Credit” means the credit made annually to a Member’s PIRP-DC Account pursuant to Section

4.01(b).

(o) “Interest Rate” means the annualized rate of interest used to determine a Member’s Interest Credit. As of the

Effective Date, the Interest Rate is the rate of interest on 30-year Treasury securities as prescribed by the Commissioner of
the United States Internal Revenue Service for the month of September immediately preceding the first day of the Plan
Year to which an Interest Credit relates. The Vice President shall

5

have the discretion to change from time to time the basis for determining the Interest Rate as necessary to ensure that the
Interest Rate is readily determinable and administrable, and that it can be reasonably expected to provide substantially a
market rate of interest over time. At all times the Interest Rate shall not exceed a level that may be considered to
constitute earnings under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(o).

(p) “Member” means an Eligible Employee who has been admitted to Membership in the DC Program pursuant to

Article III and who remains entitled to a benefit under the DC Program. In relation to each of the Employers, any
reference to a Member means a Member in or formerly in its employment. References to “Membership” are references to
the status of being a Member. The terms “Active Member” and “Inactive Member” shall have the respective meanings
stated for these terms in Section 3.03.

(q) “Pay Credit” means the credit made to an Active Member’s PIRP-DC Account pursuant to Section 4.01(a).

(r) “Plan” means the PepsiCo International Retirement Plan, which consists of the DC Program and DB Program.

(s) “Plan Year” means the 12-consecutive month period beginning on January 1 and ending on the following

December 31 of the same calendar year.

(t) “PepsiCo Organization” means the controlled group of organizations of which the Corporation is a part, as

defined by United States Internal Revenue Code section 414 and regulations issued thereunder. An entity shall only be
considered a member of the PepsiCo Organization during the period it is one of the group of organizations described in
the preceding sentence.

(u) “PIRP-DC Account” means the unfunded, notional account maintained for a Member on the books of the
Member’s Employer that indicates the dollar amount that, as of any time, is credited under the DC Program for the benefit
of the Member. The balance in such account shall be determined in accordance with interpretive principles and decisions
applied by the Vice President.

(v) “Salary” means (i) home notional base salary in the case of an Eligible Employee who is not paid on a United
States payroll, and (ii) base salary plus annual bonus in the case of an Eligible Employee who is paid on a United States
payroll. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Salary shall include home notional base salary plus annual bonus for Eligible
Employees not paid on a United States payroll who become an Active Member on or after January 1, 2021. In the case of
an Eligible Employee who is employed in a country other than the United States, the Vice President may authorize the
Eligible Employee’s Salary to be increased to reflect an amount of notional bonus that is paid to such Eligible Employee.
The determination of an Eligible Employee’s Salary in accordance with the preceding three sentences shall be made by
the Vice President and shall be conclusive and binding on all Eligible Employees.

(w) “Service” means the period during which an Eligible Employee was continuously in employment (including
all permissible periods of authorized leave of absence) with any Approved Employer. A permissible period of authorized
leave of absence is a period of absence of not more than 12 months, unless a longer period is individually authorized in
writing by the Vice President. A break in service of less than 12 months shall not be considered to have broken the
continuity of a Member’s Service. Other breaks in service (including a break in service of at least 12 months and a break
in

6

service before an individual has become a Member) shall break the continuity of an individual’s Service, and employment
before the break in service will only be counted as Service if it would otherwise qualify under this subsection and the Vice
President approves its being counted. For an individual who transfers from employment with an Employer while not an
Eligible Employee to the status of an Eligible Employee of an Approved Employer, his pre-transfer period of employment
with an Employer may be counted as Service only with the approval of the Vice President. Similarly, for an individual
who transfers from employment with an Approved Employer as an Eligible Employee to other employment with an
Employer, his post-transfer period of employment with an Employer may be counted as Service only with the approval of
the Vice President. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Vice President, Service shall not include an individual’s
periods of employment with any company or undertaking prior to it becoming an Employer or a member of the PepsiCo
Organization.

(x) “Status Change” means any change in a Member’s circumstances (other than a change in circumstances that

constitutes an Approved Transfer) that will cause the Member to become a U.S. Person.

(y) “U.S. Person” means: (1) a citizen of the United States of America; (2) a person lawfully admitted for
permanent residence in the United States of America at any time during the calendar year, or who has applied for such
permanent residence (within the meaning of United States Internal Revenue Code section 7701(b)(1)(A)); or (3) any other
person who is a resident alien of the United States of America under United States Internal Revenue Code section 7701(b)
(1)(A) because, for example, the person satisfies the substantial presence test under United States Internal Revenue Code
section 7701(b)(3) or makes an election to be treated as a United States resident under United States Internal Revenue
Code section 7701(b)(4). In addition, a person shall be considered a U.S. Person for purposes of Section 9.14 in any year
for which the person is required by the United States Internal Revenue Code to file an individual income tax return, unless
the Vice President determines that it is clear that the person has no U.S. source earned income from a member of the
PepsiCo Organization for such year.

(z) “Valuation date” means each business day, as determined by the Vice President, as of which Members’ PIRP-

DC Accounts are valued (for purposes other than distributions under Article VI) in accordance with DC Program
procedures that are then currently in effect. As of the Effective Date, the DC Program shall have a Valuation Date for all
Members as of the last day of each Plan Year. In addition, to the extent provided in Section 4.02, the DC Program shall
have a special Valuation Date prior to the end of a Plan Year for Active Members who have an Approved Transfer (and
for certain Active Members who have a Status Change) as described in Section 4.02. In accordance with procedures that
may be adopted by the Vice President, any current Valuation Date may be changed (but in such case adjustments shall
apply in the operation of the DC Program as necessary to prevent duplicate or disproportionate benefits, as determined by
the Vice President). Values are determined as of the close of a Valuation Date or, if such date is not a business day, as of
the close of the preceding business day.

(aa) “Vice President” means the Vice President, Global Benefits & Wellness of PepsiCo, Inc., but if such position
is vacant or eliminated it shall be the person who is acting to fulfill the majority of the duties of the position (or plurality
of the duties, if no one is fulfilling a majority), as such duties existed immediately prior to the vacancy or the position
elimination.

7

2.02    Construction.

(a) Gender and Number: Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, (i) a reference to one or more genders

shall include a reference to all the other genders, and (ii) the singular may include the plural, and the plural may include
the singular..

(b) Determining Periods of Years: For the purposes of the DC Program, any period of 365 consecutive days (or of

366 consecutive days, if the period includes 29  February) shall be deemed to constitute a year, but not so that in the
calculation of a number of years any day is counted more than once. Where the amount of a benefit depends upon the
calculation of a number of years or months without expressly requiring that these should be complete years or months, a
proportionate amount (i.e., a number of days) may be given for any part of a year or month which would not otherwise be
included in the calculation. Where this document makes reference to months or parts of a year, or to any other period of
time except a day, week or year the Vice President may authorize the period to be counted in days or complete calendar
months with each calendar month counted as 1/12th of a year.

th

(c) Compounds of the Word “Here”: The words “hereof” and “hereunder” and other similar compounds of the

word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire DC Program, not to any particular provision or section.

(d) Examples: Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed by a specific item

or items, or there is a passage having a similar effect, such passages of the document shall be construed as if the phrase
“without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such passage in a manner that avoids
limitation on its breadth of application).

(e) Subdivisions of this Document: This document is divided and subdivided using the following progression:

articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals.
Sections are designated by Arabic numerals containing a decimal point. Subsections are designated by lower-case letters
in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case
roman numerals in parentheses. Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses. Any reference in a section to
a subsection (with no accompanying section reference) shall be read as a reference to the subsection with the specified
designation contained in that same section. A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph references within a
subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.

8

ARTICLE III – MEMBERSHIP

3.01    Eligibility for Membership.

    Every person who the Vice President determines is an Eligible Employee shall be eligible for Membership.

3.02    Admission to Membership.

    Every person who the Vice President determines is an Eligible Employee, and who is not during the relevant time a U.S.
Person, shall, following the approval of his Membership by the Vice President, be admitted to Membership effective as of his
Entry Date. For this purpose, the relevant time includes a sufficient period before the Eligible Employee’s Proposed Entry Date as
is necessary to avoid PIRP-DC Accounts being considered deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the United
States Internal Revenue Code. No Eligible Employee or any other person shall be admitted to Membership without the approval
of the Vice President.

3.03    Active and Inactive Membership.

    A Member shall be an Active Member during the period that he is – (a) employed as an Eligible Employee, (b) not a U.S.
Person, and (c) currently approved for status as an Active Member by the Vice President. A Member shall be an Inactive Member
during any period that he does not currently meet all of the requirements to be an Active Member.

9

4.01    Contributions.

ARTICLE IV – CONTRIBUTIONS

To the extent provided in subsections (a) and (b) below, the Employer shall allocate Pay Credits and Interest Credits to a

Member’s PIRP-DC Account, each determined by the Vice President as follows –

(a) Pay Credit. To receive a Pay Credit for a Plan Year, an individual must be an Active Member during such year.

The amount of an Active Member’s Pay Credit for a Plan Year shall be determined by multiplying the Active Member’s
annualized Salary in effect as of that year’s Valuation Date by the Active Member’s applicable percentage, which shall be
one of the following: 5%, 8%, 10%, 12% or 18%.

Effective for any Eligible Employee who becomes an Active Member on or after January 1, 2021 and who does

not have any Service completed while a U.S. Person, the amount of the Active Member’s Pay Credits shall be determined
by the number of “points” attributed to the Active Member in accordance with the following:

Points
Less than 35
35-39
40-44
45-49
50-54
55-59
60-64
65 or more

Amount of Pay Credit
5% of Eligible Pay
6% of Eligible Pay
7% of Eligible Pay
8% of Eligible Pay
9% of Eligible Pay
10% of Eligible Pay
11% of Eligible Pay
12% of Eligible Pay

Such an Active Member’s points shall be determined by the sum of the Active Member’s age and years of Service, with
each expressed in whole years and days.

Otherwise, the Vice President shall specify the Active Member’s applicable percentage as of the Active Member’s
Entry Date (or, if the Member ceases to be an Active Member, and then becomes an Active Member again, as of the date
the Member again becomes an Active Member). For each subsequent Plan Year that the individual is an Active Member,
the Vice President may specify a new applicable percentage that shall apply to the Active Member for such Plan Year. An
Active Member shall cease receiving Pay Credits during any Plan Year as necessary to ensure (i) that the Active
Member’s Pay Credits do not exceed the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limit in effect for such Plan Year, and
(ii) that there is ongoing compliance with limitations set forth in Section 9.14. Specifications of an applicable percentage
by the Vice President are made in the Vice President’s sole discretion, and at no time does an Eligible Employee have a
legally binding right to be assigned any initial or increased applicable percentage.

(b) Interest Credit. To receive an Interest Credit for a Plan Year, an individual must be either an Active Member or

Inactive Member during such year, and the individual must have had a balance in his PIRP-DC Account as of the prior
Plan Year’s Valuation Date. The amount of a Member’s Interest Credit shall be determined by the Vice President by
multiplying the Interest Rate for the period since the last Valuation Date by the balance of the Member’s PIRP-DC
Account as of such last Valuation Date.

10

A Member’s Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined by the Vice President as soon as administratively practicable after
each Valuation Date. If a Member has less than one full year of Active Membership since such last Valuation Date (e.g., as may
apply in the Member’s first and last year of Membership), the Member’s Pay Credit as otherwise determined under subsection (a)
above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member’s fractional year of Active Membership. If a Member has less
than one full year of Membership since such last Valuation Date, any Interest Credit as otherwise available and determined under
subsection (b) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member’s fractional year of Membership (e.g., as may
apply in the Member’s last year of Membership). A fractional year shall be computed by dividing the Member’s days of
Membership or Active Membership (as applicable) during the Plan Year by the total number of days in such Plan Year. A period
of paid leave of absence during a Plan Year shall be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a
Member’s Pay Credit for the Plan Year in accordance with the prior sentence. However, a period of unpaid leave of absence
during a Plan Year shall not be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member’s Pay Credit
for the Plan Year in accordance with the prior sentence (and as a result, the Pay Credit for the Plan Year containing the unpaid
leave shall be prorated, or there shall be no Pay Credit, all as necessary to limit Pay Credits to the Member’s period of Active
Membership during the Plan Year). In the event a prorated Pay Credit and Interest Credit relate to the Member’s final year of
Membership, the Pay Credit and Interest Credit shall be determined as of the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date (with
proration based upon the Member’s fractional final year of Membership). The calculation of the Pay Credit and Interest Credit by
the Vice President shall be conclusive and binding on all Members (and their Dependants).

4.02    Offsets.

Notwithstanding Section 4.01, the Corporation may reduce the amount of any payment or benefit that is or would become

payable to or on behalf of a Member by the amount of any obligation of the Member to the Corporation or by the amount of –

(a) Any material benefits accrued by the Member under a retirement plan sponsored by the Corporation or by any

country, state, province or other political subdivision or locality, to the extent the Vice President determines that the
benefit amount under such retirement plan is for Service or Salary that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits
under the DC Program, and

(b) Any termination indemnity or other payment to the Member by the Employer or PepsiCo Organization related

to the Member’s termination of employment, to the extent the Vice President determines that the payment is reasonably
related to Service that is taken into account in providing Pay Credits under the DC Program.

Consistent with the foregoing, appropriate reductions may be made in the Pay Credits and Interest Credits that otherwise would
be provided to the Member under Sections 4.01 and 4.02, the balance in the Member’s PIRP-DC Account under Article V, or the
Member’s distributions under Article VI. The determination of whether a benefit is material and all other aspects of the
application of this Section 4.02 is solely in the independent discretion of the Vice President.

11

5.01    Accounting for Members’ Interests.

ARTICLE V – MEMBER ACCOUNTS

Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be credited to a Member’s PIRP-DC Account as of the Valuation Date to which such

credits relate (or, in the case of Pay Credits and Interest Credits that relate to the Member’s final year of Membership, as of the
Member’s Distribution Valuation Date) or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. A Member’s PIRP-DC Account is a
bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Member’s Pay Credits and Interest Credits (and his Employer’s liability for
such credits). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any PIRP-DC Account, and no PIRP-DC Account
shall be funded, insured or otherwise secured.

5.02    Vesting.

Subject to Sections 4.02 and 9.14, a Member shall be fully vested in, and have a nonforfeitable right to, his PIRP-DC
Account upon completing 3 years of Service, or if earlier, upon the death or disability of the Member while employed by the
Employer or PepsiCo Organization. The determination of whether a Member has become disabled for this purpose shall be made
by the Vice President in accordance with such standards as the Vice President deems to be appropriate as of the time in question.

5.03    Special Vesting for Approved Transfers and Status Changes.

(a) Automatic Special Vesting for Approved Transfers. Notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an
Active Member who will have an Approved Transfer during a Plan Year, the Active Member shall automatically have
special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of – (a) the Active Member’s Approved Transfer, or (b)
the day the Active Member would become a U.S. Person in connection with the Approved Transfer.

(b) Special Vesting for Status Changes. Also notwithstanding Section 5.02 above, in the case of an Active Member
who will have a Status Change, the Active Member may request that the Vice President apply special vesting to him as of
the last business day before the Active Member’s Status Change. In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to
be valid and effective under the DC Program, the Active Member’s request and the Vice President’s approval of the
request must both be completely final and in place prior to the date that the special vesting applies.

Subject to the next sentence, the effect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b)
above is that the Member will become vested, to the same extent as could apply under Section 5.02 if the Member vested under
that Section, as of the date that the special vesting applies. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 5.03, rights
under this Section 5.03 are subject to the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and other rights under the Plan must
remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and this Section 5.03 shall not apply to
the extent inconsistent with this requirement.

12

ARTICLE VI – DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS

6.01    Distribution Rules Generally.

A Member’s PIRP-DC Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of the Member’s termination of employment
with the PepsiCo Organization or death, as provided in Sections 6.02 and 6.03 respectively, subject to Section 4.06 (vesting). All
distributions shall be made in cash.

6.02    Distributions Upon Termination of Employment.

If a Member’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his termination of employment with the PepsiCo

Organization, such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first of the month that immediately follows
the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date. In the case of a Member whose termination of employment with the PepsiCo
Organization occurs as a result of the Member becoming disabled, for purposes of this Section, the determination of whether such
Member is disabled and the date on which such Member’s termination of employment is considered to occur shall be made by the
Vice President.

6.03    Distributions Upon Death.

If a Member’s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his death, such distribution shall be made in a single
lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Member’s Distribution Valuation Date. Amounts
paid following a Member’s death shall be paid to the Member’s Dependant; provided, however, that if no Dependant designation
is in effect at the time of the Member’s death (as determined by the Vice President), or if all persons designated as Dependants
have predeceased the Member, then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed to the Member’s
Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, as applicable, or, if the Member does not have an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible
Domestic Partner at the time of his death, to his estate.

6.04    Valuation.

In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article, the Member’s PIRP-DC Account shall
continue to be credited with Interest Credits (and debited for expenses) as specified in Article V until the Member’s Distribution
Valuation Date.

6.05    Designation of Dependant.

A Member shall designate one or more Dependants who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. A Member

shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the effective date of such election. If the
Member is married at the time he or she designates a Dependant(s), any designation under this section of a Dependant(s) who is
not the Member’s Eligible Spouse shall require the written consent of the Member’s Eligible Spouse. A revocation of a
Dependant(s) does not require consent by the Member’s Eligible Spouse. The designation of any Dependant(s), and any change
or revocation thereof, and any written consent of a Member’s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in
accordance with rules adopted by the Vice President, shall be made in writing on forms provided by the Vice President, and shall
not be effective unless and until filed with the Vice President.

13

7.01    Authority to Administer Plan.

ARTICLE VII – ADMINISTRATION

(a) Administration by the Vice President: The Plan shall be administered by the Vice President, who shall have the

authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the Vice President
hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion, and all interpretations, determinations and regulations made or issued by
the Vice President shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.

(b) Authority to Delegate: The Vice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other

persons or entities, or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties, responsibilities or other functions
under the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an action by the Vice President shall, to the extent applicable, refer to such
action by the Vice President’s delegate or other designated person.

7.02    Facility of Payment.

Whenever, in the opinion of the Vice President, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit hereunder is under a
legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Vice President may direct that
payments from the Plan be made to such person’s legal representative for his benefit, or that the payment be applied for the
benefit of such person in such manner as the Vice President considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of
the Plan.

7.03    Claims Procedure.

    The Vice President, or a party designated by the Vice President, shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and
to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits with respect to
a purported former or current Eligible Employee, Member, Dependant, or any other individual, person or entity asserting a right
to a benefit under the Plan (a “Petitioner”). As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Vice President decides in
its discretion that the Petitioner is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and
unrestricted discretion of the Vice President, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan provisions in
question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question, and even though other
Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. All decisions and determinations
made by the Vice President will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The Vice President may consider the intent of the
Company with respect to a Plan provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the
provisions set forth in any document that arguably do not contemplate considering such intent. The Vice President’s discretion is
absolute, and in any case where the breadth of the Vice President’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Vice
President (or its delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Vice President of its discretionary
authority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion).

    If, pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Petitioner is wholly or
partially denied, the Vice President, or a party designated by

14

the Vice President, will provide such Petitioner within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Vice President,
a comprehensible written notice setting forth:

(a) The specific reason or reasons for such denial;

(b) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;

(c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the Petitioner to submit to perfect the claim and

an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and

(d) A description of the Plan’s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such process).

If the Vice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may
extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Vice President will notify the Petitioner before the end of the
initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President
expects to make the final decision. Upon review, the Vice President shall provide the Petitioner a full and fair review of the claim,
including the opportunity to submit to the Vice President comments, document, records and other information relevant to the
claim and the Vice President’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records and information regardless of
whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after
receipt of the request for review, unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this
occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the Petitioner before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special
circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President expects to make the final decision. The final
decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the Petitioner; include specific reasons for the
decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide that the Petitioner is entitled
to receive, upon request and free of charge, copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his claim for
benefits.

Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis
of the record before the Vice President at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such review shall be conditioned on
the Petitioner’s having fully exhausted all rights under this section. Exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a
claim unless the Petitioner took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Vice President that the purported
Petitioner was submitting a claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) the
Petitioner is lawfully entitled to receive a copy of the requested document from the Vice President at the time and in the form
requested, (B) the Petitioner requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Vice President,
(C) the Vice President fails to provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within
such longer period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, (D) the Petitioner took steps that were sufficient to
make it reasonably clear to the Vice President that the Petitioner was actually entitled to receive the requested documents at the
time and in the form requested (i.e., generally the Petitioner must provide sufficient information to place the Vice President on
notice of a colorable claim for benefits), and (E) the documents requested and not provided are material to the determination of
one or more colorable claims of which the Petitioner has informed the Vice President.

15

7.04    Limitations on Actions.

Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in state or federal court by or on behalf of a Petitioner for the
alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner’s cause of action first
accrues.

(a) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner’s benefits under the Plan shall be deemed
to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the
claim or legal action, (ii) the date identified to the Petitioner by the Vice President on which payments shall commence, (iii) when
the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are the basis of his claim,
or (iv) the date when the benefit was first paid, provided, or denied.

(b) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to any other claim, action or suit not covered by
subsection (a) above must be brought within two years of the date when the Petitioner has actual or constructive knowledge of
the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to give rise to the claim, action or suit.

Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner, or any
representative of the Petitioner, from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications pursuant to or
following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.03 shall have no effect on this two-year time frame.

7.05    Restriction of Venue.

Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall

only be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New York, specifically the state or federal court, whichever applies,
located nearest the Corporation’s headquarters.

7.06    Effect of Specific References.

Specific references in the Plan to the Vice President’s discretion shall create no inference that the Vice President’s

discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.

16

ARTICLE VIII – AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

8.01    Continuation of the Plan.

While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely, it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance.

The Corporation hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time
provided, however, that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the balance (determined as of the date of such
amendment or termination) in the Plan account maintained for the benefit of a Member or his Dependant, except to the extent the
Member becomes entitled to an amount under another plan or practice maintained by an Employer. Specific forms (including
times) of payment are not protected under the preceding sentence. The Corporation’s rights under this Article VIII shall be as
broad as permissible under applicable law.

8.02    Amendment.

The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to this Plan from time to time, with or

without retroactive effect, subject to Section 8.01. An Employer (other than the Corporation) shall not have the right to amend the
Plan.

8.03    Termination.

The Corporation may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers.

If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the Plan shall continue in effect for the benefit of the
employees of the remaining Employers.

17

9.01    Unfunded Plan.

ARTICLE IX – MISCELLANEOUS

The Employers’ obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable
when due out of the Employer’s general funds. To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits
under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer.

9.02    Costs of the Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation, all costs, charges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and

management of the Plan shall be the costs, charges and expenses of the Employers and shall be paid by each Employer based on
the proportion of Members who are employed by such Employer as compared to the total number of Members at the time the cost
or expense is incurred.

9.03    Temporary Absence of Member.

If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death, discharge, retirement or quitting (e.g., sickness, accident,

layoff, vacation), he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is
absent, unless the Vice President determines otherwise. If the Member’s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-
time member of the armed forces of any country or of any organization engaged in national service of any such country, he shall
not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he
shall resign permanently from employment, whichever shall first occur.

9.04    Taxes, Etc.

In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the Vice President to be owing in respect of any benefit
payable from the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to withhold an amount not exceeding the amount of any such tax or assessment
or other duty from the benefit payable and shall apply the same in satisfaction of said tax or assessment or other duty.

9.05    Nonguarantee of Employment.

Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees, or as

a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to
discharge any of its employees, with or without cause.

9.06    No Right to Benefits.

No person, whether or not being a Member, shall have any claim, right or interest under the Plan except as provided by

the terms of the Plan. In the event of a Member’s termination of employment by an Employer, the resulting cessation of his
Membership shall not be grounds for any damages or any increase in damages in any action brought against the Employer or any
member of the PepsiCo Organization with respect to such termination.

18

9.07    Charges on Benefits and Recovery of Excess Payments.

All benefits in respect of a Member under the Plan shall stand charged with and be subject to deductions therefrom of all

sums in respect of losses to a member of the PepsiCo Organization or Employer or otherwise caused by misdemeanor of the
Member and on production by the member of the PepsiCo Organization or Employer of proof satisfactory to the Vice President
that any such loss ought to be made good by a Member. The relevant amount shall be deductible from the Member’s benefits and
be payable to the Employer or member of the PepsiCo Organization whose receipt shall be a valid discharge for the same.

Payments to, for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not

exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person, as provided by the terms of the Plan that
specify the amounts that are payable, the time as of which they are payable, and the person to whom they are payable.
Accordingly, any such excess payment or any other overpayment, premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of
which are hereafter referred to as an “Excess Payment”) may not be retained by the party receiving it, but must be restored
promptly to the Plan. In exchange for Member or beneficiary status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or
claim of right from the Plan, or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment), any party receiving an Excess Payment
grants to the Plan the following nonexclusive rights –

(1)    A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or

indirectly from the Plan and that is, in whole or part, an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the
amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such
payment, and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a
person, trust fund or entity).

(2)    The right to offset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest)

other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment; however, reliance on
this right is in the discretion of the Vice President, and the existence of an opportunity to apply it shall not
diminish the Plan’s rights under paragraph (1) above.

(3)    The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement
of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect, and following receipt of
an Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving any and all rights that may
correspond to such party’s present or future residence.

Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the Vice President that are in
furtherance of the Plan’s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest. In all cases, this subsection shall
maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way,
including with respect to any improper payment that is not addressed above.

9.08    Prohibited Misconduct.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Vice President determines that a

Member has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his termination of
employment with the PepsiCo Organization, the Member shall forfeit all Pay Credits and Interest Credits (whether paid
previously, being paid currently or payable in the future), and his PIRP-DC Account shall be adjusted to reflect such
forfeiture and previously paid Pay Credits and Interest Credits

19

shall be recovered. As a condition to Membership in this Plan, each Member agrees to this and each Member agrees to
repay PepsiCo the amounts it seeks to recover under this Section 9.08.

(b) Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly, by a Member shall constitute Prohibited

Misconduct:

(1) The Member accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or acquiring any
ownership interest, which involves the Member’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a business entity that
markets, sells, distributes or produces “Covered Products” (as defined below), unless such business entity makes
retail sales or consumes Covered Products without in any way competing with the PepsiCo Organization.

(2) The Member, directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member’s

recommendation, suggestion, identification or advice), soliciting any PepsiCo Organization employee to leave the
PepsiCo Organization’s employment or to accept any position with any other entity.

(3) The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo
Organization other than as necessary in his position with the PepsiCo Organization. Such confidential information
shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his positions with the PepsiCo
Organization. Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo
Organization’s customers, suppliers, distributors and potential acquisition targets; its business operations and
structure; its product lines, formulas and pricing; its processes, machines and inventions; its research and know-
how; its financial data; and its plans and strategies.

(4) The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Organization’s best
interests, including violating the Corporation’s Code of Conduct, engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of
the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his employment with the
PepsiCo Organization, or engaging in any other activity which constitutes gross misconduct.

(5) The Member engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from
communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation,
participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing information to
government authorities. The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any
information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act, an individual
shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret
that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an
attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a
complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who
files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any
document

20

containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a director, officer,
employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input, advice, guidance or
suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial on behalf of such a business
entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection, “Covered Products” shall mean any product
that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as the PepsiCo Organization is producing, marketing,
selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world – beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks,
tea, water, juice drinks, sports drinks, coffee drinks, energy drinks, and value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice
products; dairy products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks meat snacks, granola and cereal bars, and cookies;
hot cereals; pancake mixes; value-added rice products; pancake syrups; value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals;
dry pasta products; or any product or service that the Member had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo
Organization during the Member’s employment with the PepsiCo Organization.

9.09    Notices.

Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be sufficiently
given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the Vice President. In any case where under the Plan any
notice shall be required to be given to Members, it shall be sufficient if such notice is delivered to the Member’s last known
address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method (e.g., electronically) that
the Vice President determines is reasonably available to the Member.

9.10    Plan Documentation.

Every Member shall on demand be entitled to a copy of the Plan.

9.11    Currency of Payment.

Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars, or other "eligible currency," as approved by the

Vice President. The amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be converted to the selected currency using the
exchange rate, based on the methodology approved by the Vice President from time to time.

9.12    Governing Law.

The Plan shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New York and any
applicable federal law as would be applied in cases that arise in the United States District Courts that sit in the State of New York.

9.13    Exemption from ERISA.

The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”),

as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident
aliens of the United States. In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA, Active Membership in the Plan shall be limited to
individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States, and
it is intended that all permanent records and documentation

21

relating to the administration of the Plan shall be kept at a location that is outside of the United States.

9.14    Exemption from Section 409A.

In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (“Section

409A”), this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14, effective for any period to
which Section 409A applies. It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit
from the Plan vest, increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively, a “Benefit Enhancement”) as a result of their compensation
or service while a U.S. Person. However, Interest Credits may be provided on the PIRP-DC Account of a Member who is a U.S.
Person, but only to the extent the balance in the PIRP-DC Account is derived from Pay Credits that relate to Service completed
while the Member was not a U.S. Person (and Interest Credits on such Pay Credits). Accordingly, no Member shall become
entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined, following the close of such year, that the
Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the calendar year a
Member’s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence, the Vice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the
calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the Vice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a
U.S. Person for such year. In other cases, the Member’s benefit will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement
related to the calendar year of commencement, and appropriate adjustments will be made to the Member’s benefit in the
following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of commencement. This Section
9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that allocations, benefits and
rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A, and the Vice President shall have such unrestricted
authority as is necessary to ensure that it is applied in accordance with this requirement. Further, to ensure the continuation of
such exemption from Section 409A, the preceding sentence shall be applied and given overriding effect notwithstanding any
other provision or language in this Plan.

9.15     Electronic Signatures.

The words “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to this Plan or any other document or record to be

signed in connection with or related to this Plan by the Corporation Vice President, Eligible Employee, Dependant, or any other
individual shall be deemed to include electronic signatures and the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be
of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping
system, as the case may be, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law.

ARTICLE I.

Foreword

The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the

benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the Salaried Plan. PEP provides

benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based

on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.

1989 Document. The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety effective as of January 1, 1989.

The provisions of the Plan in effect prior to January 1, 1989 govern the rights and benefits of employees whose

Credited Service ended before that date (and as necessary, before the effective date of any provision with a different

pre-1989 effective date).

2005 Document. This document (the “Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document”) was first effective as of

January 1, 2005 (the “Effective Date”) and was restated to reflect amendments through December 31, 2008. It

generally retained without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement. However, it was clarified to reflect that

it set forth the terms of the Plan applicable to benefits that were grandfathered under Section 409A, i.e., generally,

benefits that were both earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 (the “Pre-409A Program”).

2016 Restatement. The 2016 restatement of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document was effective as of

April 1, 2016. There were no material modifications made to the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document as a result of the

2016 restatement. The Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document continues generally to retain without modification the

provisions of the 1989 restatement.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

The 2016 restatement reflected amendments through April 1, 2016, including amendments to reflect the

merger into this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), effective at the end of the day on

December 31, 2011. The PBG PEP document that was in effect on October 3, 2004 as amended through January 1,

2011 (“Pre-409A PBG PEP Document”) and as subsequently amended from time to time is attached hereto as

Appendix Article PBG Pre-409A; it continues to govern PBG PEP benefits that were grandfathered under Section

409A and that were subject to the Pre-409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger, except for certain

administrative provisions now governed by the main portion of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained

in Appendix Article PBG Pre-409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are

subject to Section 409A under either the PepsiCo PEP Program or the PBG PEP Program that would constitute a

material modification within the meaning of Treas. Reg.§ 1.409A-6(a)(4) as a result of the merger or the revisions to

the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document and Pre-409A PBG PEP document.

2021 Restatement. This restatement reflected amendments through January 1, 2021, including

provisions that reflected updates to the Salaried Plan’s actuarial factors that became effective January 1, 2019.

2022 Restatement: This restatement primarily updates the Plan’s claims, exhaustion, limitation and

termination provisions.

409A Program. All benefits under the Plan that are earned or vested after January 1, 1989 shall be

governed by the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program (the “409A Program”). Together, this document (the

Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document) and the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program describe the terms of a

single plan.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 2 -

Preservation of Pre-409A Program Within PEP Plan. This document (the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP

Document) has been modified to clarify (without any material modification) the integration of the Pre-409A Program

with the 409A Program. However, amounts subject to the terms of this Pre-409A Program and amounts subject to the

terms of the 409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A

Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A

Program amounts are intended to be sufficient to permit the Pre-409A Program to remain exempt from Section 409A

as a program of grandfathered benefits.

ARTICLE II.

Definitions and Construction

2.1    Definitions: This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases. Where the following

words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan with initial capitals they shall have the meaning

set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context.

Accrued Benefit: The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance

with Article V, based on the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date

of determination.

Actuarial Equivalent: Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to

the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of

the factors set forth below. The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable

under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner. In the event the Plan is amended to provide

new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless

specifically adopted by the amendment.

(1) Annuities and Inflation Protection:

(i)     Annuity Starting Dates After December 31, 2018: To determine the amount of

a Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date after December 31, 2018 (A) in the form of a

Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or other form of survivor annuity, (B) as an annuity with

inflation protection, or (C) as a period certain and life annuity or other death benefit annuity, the

Plan Administrator shall specify the factors that are to be used. Effective January 1, 2019, the

factors specified by

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 4 -

the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1 below. Subsequently, the Plan Administrator

may specify new factors for these and other forms of payment, in its sole and absolute discretion,

by a resolution adopted by the Plan Administrator. A Participant’s benefit under the Pre-409A

Program shall be determined under the actuarial factors specified and in effect as of the Annuity

Starting Date of the Participant’s benefit. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly intended and

binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment specified by the Plan

Administrator may be applied retroactively to previously accrued benefits, and without regard to

the factors that previously applied for such purpose. In particular, in adjusting benefits under the

Plan using the factors in Schedule 1 (below), the right to a benefit that is not less than would

have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall not apply (even when, for example, it

would apply under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors). For this

purpose, the phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the

Salaried Plan’s definition of “Actuarial Equivalent” effective for annuity starting dates (as defined

under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. If a Participant elects a survivor, period

certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation protection, Schedule 1(a) shall apply

to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit, period certain or other death benefit, and

Schedule 1(b) or (c) shall apply solely to adjust for the elected inflation protection (for this

purpose and

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 5 -

as applies generally when determining an Actuarial Equivalent, the adjustment resulting from

applying these factors from separate Schedules shall be determined using an actuarial

computation method that is reasonable and applied consistently to similarly situated participants).

Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date before January 1, 2019, and in the form of a

Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or other form of survivor annuity, or as an annuity with

inflation protection, the factors applicable as of such time for such purposes under the Salaried

Plan shall apply. However, in determining a Pre-409A Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting

Date before January 1, 2019, no change in such factors occurring on or after the Effective Date

in the basis for determining the amount of an annuity form of payment

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

from that in effect as of December 31, 2004 shall be taken into account to the extent it would

result in a larger annuity (but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3),

relating to the “Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit”).

(2) Lump Sums: To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, or a Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s Pension under Section 4.6, the factors applicable for such purposes under the Salaried Plan

shall apply, except that when the term “PBGC Rate” is used in the Salaried Plan in this context it shall

mean “PBGC Rate” as defined in this Plan. However, in determining a Pre-409A Pension, no

amendment, which is effective on or after the Effective Date, to the Salaried Plan’s provisions for

determining lump sums from those in effect as of December 31, 2004 shall be taken into account to the

extent that doing so is expected to result in a larger lump sum (or in the case of a Salaried Plan

amendment that becomes effective on or after January 1, 2015, a different lump sum, unless this Pre-

409A Program document is amended to expressly apply the Salaried Plan amendment in determining a

Pre-409A Pension), but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3), relating to the

“Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit.” For example, therefore, the Salaried Plan amendment that

adopted Pension Protection Act factors for lump sums effective January 1, 2008 is generally taken into

account under the Pre-409A Program, but the Salaried Plan amendment that changed the “lookback

period” and “stability period” for lump sums effective January 1, 2015 is not taken account under the

Pre-409A Program, except for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3).

(3) Other Cases: To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or on

behalf of a Participant in other cases (including to reduce a Vested Pension for early commencement),

the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the Salaried Plan. However, in determining a

Pre-409A Pension, no change occurring on or after the Effective Date in such factors from those in

effect as of December 31, 2004 shall be taken into account to the extent that it would result in a larger

pension (but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3), relating to the “Limit on the

Pre-409A Pension Benefit”).

interest adjustment for a delay in payment of his Pre-409A Pension, the amount of such interest adjustment shall be

limited to that which may be paid as part of the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 26 -

Participant’s 409A Pension, consistent with Section 409A’s payment rules and the limitation in the next sentence.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Salaried Plan to the contrary, including Section 4.8(e), a Participant shall not

receive interest for a delay in payment of his 409A Pension or Pre-409A Pension to the extent the delay is caused by

the Participant.

4.9    Cashout Distributions: Notwithstanding the availability or applicability of a different form of

payment under Article VI, the following rules shall apply in the case of certain small benefit Annuity payments:

(a)    Distribution of Participant’s Pre-409A Pension: If on the applicable benefit commencement

date the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of the Participant’s Pre-409A Pension is equal to or less than the

Cashout Limit, the Plan Administrator shall distribute to the Participant such lump sum value of the

Participant’s Pre-409A Pension. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for commencement dates prior to

December 1, 2012, a Participant shall be cashed out under this subsection if, at the Participant’s

commencement date, the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of the Participant’s Pre-409A Pension is equal

to or less than $15,000 ($10,000 in the case of a Pre-2005 Participant). Such lump sum (or portion thereof)

representing the Participant’s Pre-409A Pension shall be paid pursuant to the terms of this Pre-409A Program.

The applicable benefit commencement date shall be:

(1)    Prior to December 1, 2012, the commencement date of any 409A Pension to which

the Participant is entitled or, in the event the Participant is not entitled to a 409A Pension, the first of the

month following the Participant’s termination of employment date (however, if the lump sum value as of

that date is too great to make the distribution, but the lump sum value is

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 27 -

not too great as of his Annuity Starting Date under the terms of this Pre-409A Program, such Annuity

Starting Date shall be the applicable commencement date); and

(2)     Beginning as of December 1, 2012, the first of the month following the Participant’s

termination of employment date (however, if the lump sum value as of that date is too great to make the

distribution, but the lump sum value is not too great as of his Annuity Starting Date under the terms of

this Pre-409A Program, such Annuity Starting Date shall be the applicable commencement date).

(b)    Distribution of Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pre-409A Pension Benefit: If on the Eligible

Spouse’s applicable benefit commencement date, the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of the PEP Pre-

Retirement Spouse’s Pre-409A Pension to be paid is equal to or less than the Cashout Limit, the Plan

Administrator shall distribute to the Eligible Spouse such lump sum value of the PEP Pre-Retirement Spouse’s

Pre-409A Pension. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for commencement dates prior to December 1,

2012, an Eligible Spouse shall be cashed out under this subsection if the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value

of the Eligible Spouse’s PEP Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension is equal to or less than $15,000 ($10,000 in

the case of a Pre-2005 Participant). Such lump sum (or portion thereof) representing the Eligible Spouse’s

Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pre-409A Pension shall be paid pursuant to the terms of this Pre-409A Program.

The applicable benefit commencement date shall be:

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 28 -

(1)    Prior to December 1, 2012, the commencement date of any Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s 409A Pension to which the Eligible Spouse is entitled or, in the event the Eligible Spouse is

not entitled to a Pre Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension, the first of the month following the Participant’s

death (however, if the lump sum value as of that date is too great to make the distribution, but the lump

sum value is not too great as of the date that would be the Eligible Spouse’s benefit commencement

date under the terms of this Pre-409A Program, such benefit commencement date shall be the

applicable commencement date); and

(2)    Beginning as of December 1, 2012, the first of the month following the Participant’s

death (however, if the lump sum value as of that date is too great to make the distribution, but the lump

sum value is not too great as of the date that would be the Eligible Spouse’s benefit commencement

date under the terms of this Pre-409A Program, such benefit commencement date shall be the

applicable commencement date).

(c)    Special Cashout of Pre-409A Vested Pensions: Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the

Plan Administrator shall have discretion under this subsection to cash out a Pre-409A Vested Pension in a

single lump sum prior to the date that would apply under subsection (a).

(1)    The Plan Administrator shall have discretion under this subsection to cash out in a

single lump sum any Pre-409A Vested Pension that, as of December 1, 2012 – (i) has not otherwise

had its Annuity Starting Date occur, (ii) has an Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value that is equal to or

less than the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 29 -

Cashout Limit as of such date, and (iii) is practicable to calculate and distribute (as determined pursuant

to the exercise of the Plan Administrator’s discretion), with such cashout being made on December 1,

2012.

(2)    The Plan Administrator shall also have discretion under this subsection to cash out in

a single lump sum any Pre-409A Vested Pension that, as of the first day of any month in 2013 or 2014

specified by the Plan Administrator pursuant to the exercise of its discretion – (i) has not otherwise had

its Annuity Starting Date occur, (ii) has an Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value that is equal to or less

than the Cashout Limit as of such date, and (iii) is practicable to calculate and distribute (as determined

pursuant to the exercise of the Plan Administrator’s discretion), with such cashout being made on the

first day of the month specified.

Not later than November 30, the Plan Administrator shall memorialize in writing the exercise of its discretion

under this subsection to select Vested Pensions for cashout on December 1, 2012, through the creation of a

written list (in either hard copy or electronic form) of Participants with Pre-409A Vested Pensions who will be

cashed out. In addition, not later than the day before the date specified pursuant to paragraph (2) above, the

Plan Administrator shall memorialize in writing the exercise of its discretion under this subsection to select

Vested Pensions for cashout on the specified date, through the creation of a written list (in either hard copy or

electronic form) of Participants with Pre-409A Vested Pensions who will be cashed out.

Any lump sum distributed under this section shall be in lieu of the Pension that otherwise would be distributable to the

Participant or Eligible Spouse hereunder. To the extent necessary

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 30 -

to preserve the grandfathered status of Pre-409A Pensions, the cashout provisions described in subsections (a)

through (c) above are intended to operate in conformance with the rules for “limited cashout” features within the

meaning of Treasury Regulation sections 1.409A-3(j)(4)(v) and 1.409A-6(a)(4)(i)(E), and they shall be interpreted and

applied consistently with this regulation. No Participant or Eligible Spouse shall be given a direct or indirect election

with respect to whether the Participant’s Vested Pension or the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension will be cashed out

under this section.

4.10    Reemployment of Certain Participants: In the case of a current or former Participant who is

reemployed and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his Pre-

409A Pension will be suspended if payment of his Salaried Plan pension is suspended (or if payment would have

been suspended pursuant to such provisions if (i) it were already in pay status, and (ii) changes in the Salaried Plan

terms that occur after December 31, 2004 were disregarded). Thereafter, his Pre-409A Pension shall recommence at

the time determined under Section 6.1 (even if the suspension of his Salaried Plan pension ceases earlier).

ARTICLE V.

Amount of Retirement Pension

When a Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Post-2004 Participant under this Plan, the

amount of such Pre-409A Pension shall be determined under Section 5.1 or 5.3 (whichever is applicable), subject to

any adjustments required under Sections 4.6(b), 5.4 and 5.5. In the case of a Pre-2005 Participant, the amount of

such Participant’s Pre-409A Pension (or a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pre-409A Pension payable on his behalf) shall

be determined as provided in Article B of the Appendix.

5.1    Participant’s Pre-409A Pension

(a) Calculating the Pre-409A Pension: In the case of a Post-2004 Participant, such Participant’s

Pre-409A Pension shall be calculated as follows (on the basis specified in subsection (b) below and using the

definitions appearing in subsection (c) below):

(1)     His Total Pension, reduced by

(2)     His Salaried Plan Pension.

(b) Basis for Determining: The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount in subsection (a) above shall

be the greater of the amount determined on the basis set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) below, but never more

than the limitation specified in paragraph (3) below:

(1)    Present Value Method: The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount under this paragraph

shall be determined initially as a present value of the Participant’s benefit under subsection (a) as of

December 31, 2004 (determined as if the Participant voluntarily terminated on that date without cause,

received a payment on the earliest possible commencement date

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 32 -

(“Earliest Date”) thereafter, and such payment was in the form with the maximum value available to the

Participant in connection with a termination at such time), using the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum

factors in effect on such date (“2004 Lump Sum Factors”) to determine the present value. Such present

value amount shall then be increased, if the Participant had not yet attained the Participant’s Earliest

Date as of December 31, 2004, for both interest and survivorship through such Earliest Date, using the

2004 Lump Sum Factors.

(2)     Accrued Benefit Method: The Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount under this

paragraph shall be based on the Participant’s Accrued Benefit as of December 31, 2004, but with such

Accrued Benefit amount reduced for early commencement (where applicable based on the Participant’s

actual Annuity Starting Date for his Pre-409A Pension), based upon the reduction factors for early

commencement applicable to the Participant’s status as eligible for a retirement benefit (under Section

4.2) or a vested benefit (under Section 4.3), whichever applies.

(3)    Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit: Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2) above,

a Participant’s Pre-409A Pension Benefit amount shall never exceed the Participant’s Total Pension

reduced by his Salaried Plan Pension, with each calculated as of the actual Annuity Starting Date of

Participant’s Pre-409A Pension. For purposes of this paragraph (3), the provisions of Article IV that

freeze the Participant’s status as of December 31, 2004 (or consider only the status on such date), and

the provisions of this

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 33 -

document that bar taking into account Plan changes that are effective after December 31, 2004 shall

not be taken into account.

(c) Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

(1) A Participant’s “Total Pension” means the greater of:

(i) The amount of the Participant’s pension determined under the terms of the

Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415

of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the

actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (relating to benefits that

are deferred beyond the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date); or

(ii) The amount (if any) of the Participant’s PEP Guarantee under Section 5.2.

For purposes of subsection (b)(1) and (2), the determination in clause (i) and (ii) above shall be made

(except, in the case of subsection (b)(2), with respect to early commencement reductions, which shall be

made as of the Annuity Starting Date) as of December 31, 2004, and (except to the extent the provisions

of the Plan specifically authorize taking into account subsequent changes) shall be made on the basis of

the terms of the Salaried Plan without taking into account changes after December 31, 2004. As

necessary to ensure the Participant’s receipt of a “greater of” benefit, the foregoing comparison between

clause (i) and clause (ii) shall be made by reflecting, as applicable, the relative value of forms of

payment.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 34 -

(2) A Participant’s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Participant’s pension

determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan. For purposes of subsection (b)(1) and (2), the

determination of a Participant’s Salaried Plan Pension shall be made (except, in the case of subsection

(b)(2), with respect to early commencement reductions, which shall be made as of the Annuity Starting

Date) as of December 31, 2004, and (except to the extent the provisions of the Plan specifically

authorize taking into account subsequent changes) shall be made on the basis of the terms of the

Salaried Plan without taking into account changes after December 31, 2004.

5.2    PEP Guarantee: A Post-2004 Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be

entitled to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below. In the case of Participants who are not

eligible under subsection (a), the PEP Guarantee shall not apply.

(a) Eligibility: A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988

pensionable earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable

earnings” means the Participant’s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year, within the meaning of the Salaried

Plan as in effect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity

attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer.

(b) PEP Guarantee Formula: The amount of a Participant’s PEP Guarantee shall be determined

under the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 35 -

(1) Formulas: The amount of a Participant’s Pension under this paragraph shall be

determined in accordance with subparagraph (i) below. However, if the Participant was actively

employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1,

1975, the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts determined

under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the

amount of a Vested Pension.

(i) Formula A: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:

(A) 3 percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for the

first 10 years of Credited Service, plus

(B) 1 percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for each

year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less

(C) 1-2/3 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount

multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.

In determining the amount of a Vested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be

calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he

remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest

Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Severance from Service

Date, and then shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 36 -

amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant’s actual years of Credited Service

on his Severance from Service Date (or December 31, 2004, if earlier) and the denominator of

which is the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he remained in the employ of

an Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.

(ii)    Formula B: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater

of (A) or (B) below:

(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number

of years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security

Amount, or

(B)    3 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of

years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’s Primary

Social Security Amount.

In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be

calculated on the basis of the Participant’s Credited Service (determined in accordance with

Section 3.3(d)(3) of the Salaried Plan, as in effect on December 31, 2004), and his Highest Average

Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at the date of disability (or as of such earlier date

as may apply under Section 5.1(b)).

(2) Calculation: The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to

paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 37 -

(i) Surviving Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic Partner’s Annuity: Subject to

subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, the Participant’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible

Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the

Participant’s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the

Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall

begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and shall

end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic

Partner’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is more than 10 years

younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be

adjusted as provided below.

(A) For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor

benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by

0.8 percent.

(B) For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or

Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to

such Eligible

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 38 -

Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.

(ii) Reductions: The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’s

PEP Guarantee.

(A) If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment

amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit

commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal

Retirement Date.

(B) If the Participant is entitled to a Vested Pension, the payment amount

shall be reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal

Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b)

reductions for any Pre-Retirement Spouse’s coverage shall apply.

(C) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form

that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the

life of the surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner, that is greater

than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’s Pension

under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the

Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the

foregoing provisions of this section.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 39 -

(D) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form

that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible

Domestic Partner. In this instance, the Participant’s Pension under this section shall be

reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the

Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’s life.

(E) This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an

Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance,

the Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the

benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected

Annuity without such protection.

(iii) Lump Sum Conversion: The amount of the Retirement Pension determined

under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a

lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under

this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above

and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.

5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pre-409A Pension: The monthly amount of the Pre-

Retirement Spouse’s Pre-409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse of a Post-2004 Participant under

Section 4.6 shall be determined under subsection (a) below.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 40 -

(a) Calculation: An Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pre-409A Pension shall be equal

to:

(1)     The Eligible Spouse’s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension, reduced by

(2)     The Eligible Spouse’s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension.

(b) Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

(1) An Eligible Spouse’s “Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension” means the greater of:

(i) The amount of the Eligible Spouse’s pre-retirement spouse’s pension determined

under the principles and limitations of Section 5.1(b) and under the terms of the Salaried Plan in

effect on December 31, 2004 (except as otherwise applicable under Section 5.1(b)), but without

regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such

limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment

under Section 5.7(d) of the Salaried Plan (relating to benefits that are deferred beyond the

Participant’s Normal Retirement Date); or

(ii) The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s Pension determined under the principles and limitations of Section 5.1(b) and under

subsection (c).

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 41 -

In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated

with reference to the specific time of payment applicable to the Eligible Spouse.

(2)    An “Eligible Spouse’s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension” means the

Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension that would be payable to the Eligible Spouse under the principles and

limitations of Section 5.1(b) under the terms of the Salaried Plan in effect on December 31, 2004

(except as otherwise applicable under Section 5.1(b)).

(c) PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension: An Eligible Spouse’s PEP Guarantee Pre-

Retirement Spouse’s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below, whichever is

applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the Participant

under Section 5.2.

(1) Normal Rule: The Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension payable under this paragraph

shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity, under a Qualified Joint and

Survivor Annuity, if the Participant had:

(i) Separated from service on the earliest of the date of death, his actual Severance

from Service Date;

(ii) Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date payments

of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension are to commence; and

(iii) Died on the day immediately following such commencement.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 42 -

If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension under this paragraph commences or is deemed to

commence prior to the date which would have been the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date,

appropriate reductions for early commencement shall be applied to the Qualified Joint and Survivor

Annuity upon which the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension is based.

(2) Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees: Notwithstanding paragraph (1)

above, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described in Section 4.6(a)

shall not be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined

under Section 5.2 in accordance with the principles and limitations of Section 5.1(b) (if a comparable 25

percent benefit is available on behalf of the Participant under the Salaried Plan). A Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s Pension under this paragraph is not reduced for early commencement.

5.4    Certain Adjustments: Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject

to adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan

or a nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored

by a member of the PepsiCo Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals.

(a) Adjustments for Rehired Participants: This subsection shall apply to a current or former

Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is

recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the

Participant’s Pre-409A Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder. For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 43 -

under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits

are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified

plans.

(b) Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans: If the benefit paid under a specified

plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether

the increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise),

the PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment

hereunder, the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is

specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.

5.5    Excludable Employment: Effective for periods of employment on or after June 30, 1997, an

executive classified as level 22 or above (or the equivalent) whose employment by an Employer is for a limited

duration assignment shall not become entitled to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such

employment. In addition, in the case of agreements entered into after January 1, 2009, an executive who has signed

a written agreement with the Company pursuant to which the individual either (i) waives eligibility under the Plan

(even if the individual otherwise meets the definition of Employee under the Plan), or (ii) agrees not to participate in

the Plan, shall not thereafter becomes entitled to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such

employment (whichever applies). Written agreements may be entered into either before or after the executive

becomes eligible for or begins participation in the Plan, and such written agreement may take any form that is

deemed

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 44 -

effective by the Company. All written agreements under this section 5.5 shall be irrevocable by the individual once

executed.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 45 -

ARTICLE VI.

Distribution Options

The terms of this Article govern (i) the distribution of benefits to a Participant who becomes entitled to a

Pre-409A Pension, and (ii) the continuation of benefits (if any) to such Participant’s beneficiary following the

Participant’s death. Other than as set forth in section 4.9 (cashout distributions), a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension

derived from the Pre-409A Program shall be payable as an Annuity for the life of the Eligible Spouse or Eligible

Domestic Partner, as applicable, in all cases, subject to Section 4.9 (cashout distributions). The distribution of a 409A

Pension is governed by the terms of the 409A Program.

6.1    Form and Timing of Distributions: This section shall govern the form and timing of distributions of

Pre-409A Pensions that begin on or after March 1, 1992. Plan distributions that begin before that date shall be

governed by the prior terms of the Plan. The provisions of this Section 6.1 are in all cases subject to the cashout rules

set forth in Section 4.9.

(a) No Advance Election: This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who does not have an

Advance Election in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, or (ii) who

terminates employment prior to Retirement. Subject to the next sentence, a Participant described in this

subsection shall be paid his Pre-409A Pension in the same form and at the same time as he is paid his

Pension under the Salaried Plan. If a Participant’s Salaried Plan Annuity Starting Date occurs while he is still

an employee of the PepsiCo Organization (because of the time of payment provisions in Code section 401(a)

(9)), payment under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month next following the Participant’s

Severance from Service Date. In this instance, the form of payment under this Plan shall remain that

applicable under the Salaried Plan. If the Participant will be paid his pension under the Salaried Plan in a form

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 46 -

of payment that is not available to the Participant under this Pre-409A Program (e.g., because the Participant

attains Retirement status under the Salaried Plan but does not attain Retirement status under this Pre-409A

Program, based on applying the terms of the Salaried Plan in effect on December 31, 2004), the principles of

subsection (b)(2) below will govern the determination of the Participant’s form of payment.

(b) Advance Election in Effect: This subsection shall apply to a Participant who has an Advance

Election in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date. To be in effect, an

Advance Election must meet the advance receipt and other requirements of Section 6.3(b).

(1) Lump Sum Election: If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance

Election to receive a Single Lump Sum in effect as of the close of business on the day before his

Retirement Date, the Participant’s Pre-409A Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid as a

Single Lump Sum as of the first of the month coincident with or next following his Retirement Date.

(2) Annuity Election: If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election

to receive an Annuity in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, the

Participant’s Pre-409A Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid in an Annuity beginning on the

first of the month coincident with or next following his Retirement Date. The following provisions of this

paragraph govern the form of Annuity payable in the case of a Participant described in this paragraph.

(i) Salaried Plan Election: A Participant who has a qualifying Salaried Plan election

shall receive his distribution in the same

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 47 -

form of Annuity the Participant selected in such qualifying Salaried Plan election. For this

purpose, a “qualifying Salaried Plan election” is a written election of a form of payment by the

Participant that: (A) is currently in effect under the Salaried Plan as of the close of business on

the day before the Participant’s Retirement Date, and (B) specifies an Annuity as the form of

payment for all or part of the Participant’s Retirement Pension under the Salaried Plan. For

purposes of the preceding sentence, a Participant who elects a combination lump sum and

Annuity under the Salaried Plan is considered to have specified an Annuity for part of his

Salaried Plan Pension.

(ii) PEP Election: A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) and who has

a PEP Election in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date shall

receive his distribution in the form of Annuity the Participant selects in such PEP Election.

(iii) No PEP Election: A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii)

above shall receive his distribution in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if he is

married, or in the form of a Single Life Annuity if he is not married. For purposes of this

subparagraph (iii), a Participant shall be considered married if he is married on the day before his

Retirement Date.

6.2    Available Forms of Payment: The forms of payment set forth in subsections (a) and (b) may be

provided to any Participant who is entitled to a Pre-409A

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 48 -

Retirement Pension. The forms of payment for other Participants are set forth in subsection (c) below. The provisions

of this section are effective for Annuity Starting Dates after 1989 and earlier distributions shall be governed by prior

terms of the Plan.

(a) Basic Forms of Payment: A Participant’s Pre-409A Retirement Pension shall be distributed in

one of the forms of payment listed in this subsection. The particular form of payment applicable to a Participant

shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.1. Payments shall commence on the date specified in

Section 6.1 and shall end on the date specified in this subsection.

(1) Single Life Annuity Option: A Participant may receive his Pre-409A Pension in the form

of a Single Life Annuity, which provides monthly payments ending with the last payment due prior to his

death.

(2) Survivor Options: A Participant may receive his Pre-409A Pension in accordance with

one of the following survivor options:

(i) 100 Percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced Pre-409A

Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments

in the same reduced amount shall continue after the Participant’s death to his beneficiary for life,

beginning on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and

ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the beneficiary’s death.

(ii) 75 Percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced Pre-409A

Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments

in the amount of 75

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 49 -

percent of such reduced Pre-409A Pension shall be continued after the Participant’s death to his

beneficiary for life, beginning on the first day of the month coincident with or following the

Participant’s death and ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the beneficiary’s death.

(iii) 50 Percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced Pre-409A

Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments

in the amount of 50 percent of such reduced Pre-409A Pension shall be continued after the

Participant’s death to his beneficiary for life, beginning on the first day of the month coincident

with or following the Participant’s death and ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the

beneficiary’s death. A 50 percent survivor option under this paragraph shall be a Qualified Joint

and Survivor Annuity if the Participant’s beneficiary is his Eligible Spouse.

(iv) Ten Years Certain and Life Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced Pre-

409A Pension which shall be payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months. If

the retired Participant dies before 120 payments have been made, the monthly Pension amount

shall be paid for the remainder of the 120 month period to the Participant’s primary beneficiary

(or if the primary beneficiary has predeceased the Participant, the Participant’s contingent

beneficiary).

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 50 -

(3) Single Lump Sum Payment Option: A Participant may receive payment of his Pre-

409A Pension in the form of a Single Lump Sum payment.

(4) Combination Lump Sum/Monthly Benefit Option: A Participant who does not have an

Advance Election in effect may receive a portion of his Pre-409A Pension in the form of a lump sum

payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in paragraphs

(1) and (2) above. The Pre-409A Pension is divided between the two forms of payment based on the

whole number percentages designated by the Participant on a form provided for this purpose by the

Plan Administrator. For the election to be effective, the sum of the two percentages designated by the

Participant must equal 100 percent.

(i) The amount of the Pre-409A Pension paid in the form of a lump sum is

determined by multiplying: (A) the amount that would be payable to the Participant as a Single

Lump Sum payment if the Participant’s entire benefit were payable in that form, by (B) the

percentage that the Participant has designated for receipt in the form of a lump sum.

(ii) The amount of the Pre-409A Pension paid in the form of a monthly benefit is

determined by multiplying: (A) the amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Participant,

determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) above (whichever applies), by (B) the

percentage that the Participant has designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 51 -

(b) Inflation Protection: The following levels of inflation protection may be provided to any

Participant who is entitled to a Pre-409A Retirement Pension (except to the extent such Pre-409A Pension is

paid as a lump sum).

(1) 5 Percent Inflation Protection: A Participant’s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced,

but thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 5 percent. The amount of the

increase shall be the difference between inflation in the prior year and 5 percent.

(2) 7 Percent Inflation Protection: A Participant’s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced,

but thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 7 percent. The amount of the

increase shall be the difference between inflation in the prior year and 7 percent.

Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1, beginning with the

second January 1 following the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date. The amount of inflation in the prior year

shall be determined based on inflation in the 12-month period ending on September 30 of such year, with

inflation measured in the same manner as applies on the Effective Date for adjusting Social Security benefits

for changes in the cost of living. Inflation protection that is in effect shall carry over to any survivor benefit

payable on behalf of a Participant, and shall increase the otherwise applicable survivor benefit as provided

above. Any election by a Participant to receive inflation protection shall be irrevocable by such Participant or

his surviving beneficiary.

(c) Available Options for Vested Benefits: The forms of payment available for a Participant with a

Pre-409A Vested Pension are a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or a 75 Percent Survivor Annuity for

married Participants, and a Single

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 52 -

Life Annuity for both married and unmarried Participants. The applicable form of payment shall be determined

in accordance with Section 6.1(a).

6.3    Procedures for Elections: This section sets forth the procedures for making Advance Elections

and PEP Elections.

(a) In General: To qualify as an Advance Election or PEP Election for purposes of Section 6.1, an

election must be made in writing, on the form designated by the Plan Administrator, and must be signed by the

Participant. These requirements also apply to any revocations of such elections. Spousal consent is not

required for any election (or revocation of election) under the Plan.

(b) Advance Election: To qualify as an Advance Election, an election must be made on or after

July 15, 1993 and meet the following requirements.

(1) Election: The Participant shall designate on the Advance Election form whether the

Participant elects to take his Pre-409A Pension in the form of an Annuity or a Single Lump Sum.

(2) Receipt by Plan Administrator: The Advance Election must be received by the Plan

Administrator before the start of the calendar year containing the Participant’s Retirement Date, and at

least 6 months before that Retirement Date. An election that meets the foregoing requirements shall

remain effective until it is changed or revoked.

(3) Change or Revocation of Election: A Plan Participant may change an Advance

Election by filing a new Election that meets the foregoing requirements. A Plan Participant may revoke

an Advance Election only by filing a revocation that is received by the Plan Administrator before the

start of the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 53 -

calendar year containing the Plan Participant’s Retirement Date, and at least 6 months before that

Retirement Date.

Any Advance Election by a Participant shall be void if the Participant is not entitled to a Pre-409A Retirement

Pension.

(c) PEP Election: A PEP Election may only be made by a Participant who has an Advance

Election to receive an Annuity in effect at the time his PEP Election is received by the Plan Administrator. In

determining whether an Advance Election is in effect for this purpose, the advance receipt requirement of

subsection (b)(2) shall be considered met if it will be met by the Participant’s proposed Retirement Date.

(1) Election: The Participant shall designate on the PEP Election form the Annuity form of

benefit the Participant selects from those described in Section 6.2, including the Participant’s choice of

inflation protection, subject to the provisions of this Article VI. The forms of payment described in

Section 6.2(a)(3) and (4) are not available pursuant to a PEP Election.

(2) Receipt by the Plan Administrator: The PEP Election must be received by the Plan

Administrator no earlier than 180 days (90 days prior to January 1, 2007) before the Participant’s

Retirement Date, and no later than the close of business on the day before the Participant’s Retirement

Date. The Participant shall furnish proof of the age of his beneficiary (including his Eligible Spouse or

Eligible Domestic Partner if applicable), to the Plan Administrator by the day before the Participant’s

Retirement Date, for any form of payment which is subject to reduction in accordance with subsection

6.2(c) above.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 54 -

A Participant may change his PEP Election by filing a new Election with the Plan Administrator that meets the

foregoing requirements. The Participant’s PEP Election shall become effective at the close of business on the

day before the Participant’s Retirement Date. Any PEP Election by a Participant shall be void if the Participant

does not have an Advance Election in effect at such time.

(d) Elections Rules for Annuity Starting Dates: When amounts become payable to a Participant in

accordance with Article IV, they shall be payable as of the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date and the election

procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant’s unpaid accruals

under this Pre-409A Program as of such Annuity Starting Date, with the following exception. In the case of a

Participant who is rehired after his initial Annuity Starting Date and who (i) is currently receiving an Annuity that

remained in pay status upon rehire, or (ii) was previously paid a lump sum distribution (other than a cashout

distribution described in Section 4.9(a)), the Participant’s subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as a result of his

termination of reemployment), and the election procedures at such subsequent Annuity Starting Date, shall

apply only to the portion of his benefit that accrues after his rehire. Any prior accruals that remain to be paid as

of the Participant’s subsequent Annuity Starting Date shall continue to be payable in accordance with the

elections made at his initial Annuity Starting Date under this Pre-409A Program.

For purposes of this section, an election shall be treated as received on a particular day if it is: (A) postmarked that

day, or (B) actually received by the Plan Administrator on that day. Delivery under clause (B) must be made by the

close of business, which time is to be determined by the Plan Administrator.

6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options:

(a) Effect of Certain Deaths: If a Participant makes a PEP Election for a form of payment

described in Section 6.2(a)(2) and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of Section 6.2(a)

(2)(iv)) dies before the PEP Election becomes effective, the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant

dies after such PEP Election becomes effective but before his Pre-409A Retirement Pension actually

commences, the election shall be given effect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse,

Eligible Domestic Partner or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month following his death

(any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant who has

elected the form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant dies: (i) after the PEP

Election has become effective, (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary, and (iii) before

receiving 120 payments under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of

payment shall be paid to the Participant’s estate. If payments have commenced under such form of payment to

a Participant’s primary or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed,

then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’s estate.

(b) Beneficiary Who is Not an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner: If a Participant’s

beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, he may not elect:

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 56 -

(i) The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his

nonspouse beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than he is, or

(ii) The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his nonspouse

beneficiary is more than 19 years younger than he is.

6.5    Designation of Beneficiary: A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a

form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts

payable on his death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form or an approved election form filed

under the Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv),

the Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary. A Participant

(whether active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to

when his election is finally effective. The designation of any beneficiary, and any change or revocation thereof, shall

be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator. A beneficiary designation shall not be effective

unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator. If no beneficiary is properly designated, then a Participant’s election

of a survivor’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2) shall not be given effect. A Participant entitled to a Pre-409A

Vested Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary; if the Participant is permitted under Section

6.2 to elect an optional form of payment, then his beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner

on his Annuity Starting Date.

6.6    Payment of FICA and Related Income Taxes: As provided in section 6.7 of the Plan Document for

the Section 409A Program, a portion of a Participant’s 409A Pension, if any, shall be paid as a single lump sum and

remitted directly to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or other applicable tax authority in satisfaction of the

Participant’s FICA Amount and the related withholding of income tax at source on wages (imposed under Code

Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable state, local or foreign tax laws as a result

of the payment of the FICA Amount) and the additional withholding of income tax at source on wages that is

attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes (all such amounts due are referred to collectively as “Employment

Taxes”). To the extent that a Participant’s 409A Pension, if any, is insufficient to pay the Employment Taxes when due

(including if the Participant’s 409A Pension has not commenced at the time the Employment Taxes are due), a

portion of the Participant’s Pre-409A Pension, if any, shall be paid as a single lump sum and remitted directly to the

applicable tax authority in satisfaction of any amounts necessary to satisfy fully the Employment Taxes.

ARTICLE VII.

Administration

7.1    Authority to Administer Plan: The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator, which shall

have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator

shall maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the

Participant in writing, including the Participant’s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan

Administrator’s interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons

and parties concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any

restrictions that might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including

with respect to the Company or the Plan Administrator.

7.2    Facility of Payment: Whenever, in the Plan Administrator’s opinion, a person entitled to receive

any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so

as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the

legal representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of

such person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance

with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under

the provisions of the Plan.

7.3    Claims Procedure: The Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan Administrator, shall

have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for

benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits. As a result, benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the

Plan Administrator decides

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 59 -

in its discretion that the Participant (or other applicant) is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder

shall be made in the absolute and unrestricted discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (i) such discretion is not

expressly granted by the Plan provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by

the Plan provisions in question, and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for

a decision or determination. All decisions and determinations made by the Plan Administrator will be final, conclusive,

and binding on all parties. The Plan Administrator may consider the intent of the Company with respect to a Plan

provision in making any determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any

document that arguably do not contemplate considering such intent. The Plan Administrator’s discretion is absolute,

and in any case where the breadth of the Plan Administrator’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the

Plan Administrator (or its delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Plan

Administrator of its discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard

(i.e., abuse of discretion).If, pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on

behalf of a Participant or beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator, or a party

designated by the Plan Administrator, will provide such claimant the claims review process described in this Section.

The Plan Administrator has the discretionary right to modify the claims process described in this Section in any

manner so long as the claims review process, as modified, includes the steps described below. Within a 90-day

response period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator, the Plan Administrator will notice the

claimant of:

(a) The specific reason or reasons for the denial;

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 60 -

(b) Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;

(c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit to

perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and

(d) A description of the Plan’s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to such

process and a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further denial on

review).

If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances required an extension of time for processing the claim

it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant

before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date

by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. Further review of a claim is available upon written

request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the claimant receives written notice of the

denial of the claim. Upon review, the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim,

including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, documents, records and other information

relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator’s review shall take into account such comments, documents, records

and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination. The decision on

review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless circumstances warrant an extension

of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant

before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 61 -

date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decisions. The final decision shall be in writing and

drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and include specific reasons for the decision with

references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based.

Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator, or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely

on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any such

review shall be conditioned on the claimant’s having fully exhausted all rights under this Section as is more fully

explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this Section

may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other

applicable guidance.

7.4    Effect of Specific References: Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator’s discretion

shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other

provision, is less complete or broad.

7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court. Before filing any

Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the

Claimant’s rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.

(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is

intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as many circumstances as possible (and any steps

necessary to clarify or effect this intent may be taken).

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 62 -

(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion

of the Plan’s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be

limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before the Plan Administrator in the claims

procedure.

(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other

Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater

significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with

novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and

(iv) even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that

directly apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon

notice of the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to)

the claims procedures of Section 7.3 that apply to claims for benefits).

(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class

basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be

made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.

(e)    For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a claim unless the

purported Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that

the purported Claimant was submitting a claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 63 -

documents unless (A) the Claimant is lawfully entitled to receive a copy of the requested document from the

Plan Administrator at the time and in the form requested, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a

writing that is addressed to and actually received by the Plan Administrator, (C) the Plan Administrator fails to

provide the requested documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer

period as may be reasonable under the facts and circumstances, (D) the Claimant took steps that were

sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was actually entitled to

receive the requested documents at the time and in the form requested (i.e., generally the Claimant must

provide sufficient information to place the Plan Administrator on notice of a colorable claim for benefits), and

(E) the documents requested and not provided are material to the determination of one or more colorable

claims of which the Claimant has informed the Plan Administrator.

(f)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply.

(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter.

(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of the

following –

(A)    The interpretation of the Plan;

(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan;

(C)     The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light of

applicable law;

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 64 -

(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been validly

adopted or put into effect;

(E)    The administration of the Plan;

(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms, conditions or

requirements of ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of whether such terms,

conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part, incorporated into the terms, conditions or

requirements of the Plan;

(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;

(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary duty; or

(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan

Administrator, or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way.

(iii)    A “Claimant” is any Employee, former Employee, Participant, former Participant,

beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, estate, heir or representative of any of the foregoing

individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a relationship to any of the foregoing individuals

or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of the foregoing, who has a Claim.

7.6    Limitations on Actions. Any claim filed under section 7.3 and any action filed in state or federal

court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Participant, beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity

(collectively, a “Petitioner”) for the alleged

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 65 -

wrongful denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or violation of ERISA-protected rights must be

brought within two years of the date the Petitioner’s cause of action first accrues.

(a) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner’s benefits under

the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the

calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action, (ii) the date identified to the

Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or

constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are the basis of his claim, or (iv)

the date when the benefit was first paid, provided, or denied.

(b) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged interference

with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or constructive

knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to constitute interference with

ERISA-protected rights.

(c) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to any other claim, action or

suit not covered by subsection (a) or (b) above must be brought within two years of the date when the claimant

has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to give

rise to the claim, action or suit.

Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner, or any

representative of the Petitioner, from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications

pursuant to or following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.3 shall have no effect on this two-year

time frame.

7.7    Restriction on Venue. Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the

Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner (as defined in Section 7.6 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United

States District Court for the Southern District of New York, effective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1,

2011.

ARTICLE VIII.

Miscellaneous

8.1    No guarantee of Employment: Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of

employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the

employment of an Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or

without cause.

8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits: Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits

under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,

encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to

anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits

payable hereunder, including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or

similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company. The Company shall not in any manner

be liable for, or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits

hereunder.

8.3    Unfunded Plan: The Company’s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall

constitute liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’s general funds. To the extent the

Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than

the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

8.4    Action by the Company: Any action by the Company under this Plan, including any amendment

authorized to be made under Section 9.2, may be made by the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, any

person or persons authorized (directly or indirectly) by the Board may take such action on behalf of the Company.

8.5    Indemnification: Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine otherwise, the

Company shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any employee acting in good faith within the scope of his

employment in carrying out the administration of the Plan.

8.6    Code Section 409A: At all times, this Plan shall be operated to preserve the status of benefits

under this Pre-409A Program as being exempt from Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of this

Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provision of the prior sentence shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision

of the Plan. Accordingly, in determining rights and benefits under this Pre-409A Program, changes in the Salaried

Plan that are effective after December 31, 2004 shall be disregarded to the extent necessary to avoid a modification

of this Pre-409A Program that would constitute a material modification for purposes of Section 409A.

8.7    Authorized Transfers: If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo

Organization, the liability for any benefits accrued while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Organization

shall remain with the Company, except as otherwise expressly provided by an agreement between the Company and

the Participant’s new employer.

8.8    Electronic Signatures: The words “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to

this Plan or any other document or record to be signed in connection with or related to this Plan by the Company,

Plan Administrator, Employee or other individual shall be deemed to include electronic signatures and the keeping of

records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually

executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the fullest extent

permissible under applicable law.

ARTICLE IX.

Amendment and Termination

This Article governs the Company’s right to amend and or terminate the Plan. The Company’s

amendment and termination powers under this Article shall be subject, in all cases, to the restrictions on amendment

and termination in Section 409A and shall be exercised in accordance with such restrictions to ensure continued

exemption from Section 409A in accordance with Section 8.6. The Company’s rights under this Article IX shall be as

broad as permissible under applicable law.

9.1    Continuation of the Plan: While the Company and the Employers intend to continue the Plan

indefinitely, they assume no contractual obligation as to its continuance. In accordance with Section 8.4, the

Company hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any

time provided, however, that no such amendment or termination shall adversely affect the amount of benefit to which

a Participant or his beneficiary is entitled under Article IV on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the

Participant becomes entitled to an amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the

Company (except as necessary to preserve the exemption from Section 409A of this Pre-409A Program). Specific

forms of payment are not protected under the preceding sentence.

9.2    Amendments: The Company may, in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to

this Plan from time to time, with or without retroactive effect, including any amendment or amendments to eliminate

available distribution options under Article VI hereof at any time before the earlier of the Participant’s Annuity Starting

Date under this Plan or under the Salaried Plan; provided, however, that no amendment of the Plan shall be effective

to the extent that the amendment would be considered a “material modification” (as

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 71 -

that term is defined in Section 409A) of the Pre-409A Program and would, as a result, cause the Pre-409A Program

to be subject to Section 409A. An Employer (other than the Company) shall not have the right to amend the Plan.

9.3    Termination: The Company may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as to the

participation of one or more Employers. If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers, the

Plan shall continue in effect for the benefit of the Employees of the remaining Employers.

ARTICLE X.

ERISA Plan Structure

This Plan document in conjunction with the plan document(s) for the 409A Program encompasses three

separate plans within the meaning of ERISA, as are set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c). This division into

separate plans shall be effective as of July 1, 1996; previously the plans set forth in subsections (b) and (c) were a

single plan within the meaning of ERISA.

(a) Excess Benefit Plan: An excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA,

maintained solely for the purpose of providing benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations

on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.

(b) Excess Compensation Top Hat Plan: A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the

purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated

employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides benefits for

Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code on benefits

under the Salaried Plan (after taking into account any benefits under the excess benefit plan). For ERISA

reporting purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan I.

(c) Preservation Top Hat Plan: A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of

providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within

the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides grandfather benefits to those

Salaried Plan participants described in section 5.2(a) hereof, by preserving for them the pre-1989

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 73 -

level of benefit accrual that was in effect before the Salaried Plan’s amendment effective January 1, 1989

(after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan and Excess Compensation Top Hat

Plan). For ERISA reporting purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension

Equalization Plan II.

Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the

purpose indicated in (a) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation Top Hat

Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above; then any remaining benefits shall be

allocated to the Preservation Top Hat Plan. These three plans are severable for any and all purposes as directed by

the Company.

Applicable Law

The provisions of this Plan shall be construed and administered according to, and its validity and

enforceability shall be governed by, enforced in accordance with, and determined under (1) ERISA and any other

applicable federal law as would be applied in cases that arise in the United States District Court for the Southern

District of New York, and (2) to the extent ERISA does not preempt state law, the internal laws of the state of New

York.

If any provision of this Plan is, or is hereafter declared to be, void, voidable, invalid or otherwise

unlawful, the remainder of the Plan shall not be affected thereby.

Foreword

This Appendix sets forth additional provisions applicable to individuals specified in the Articles of this

shall govern.

ARTICLE A

Accruals for 1993 and 1994

This Article A of the Appendix shall be effective on the date the Plan is adopted.

A.1 Accruals for 1993 and 1994: This section shall apply to any individual:

(i) who is a Salaried Plan Participant and employed by the PepsiCo Organization on

December 31, 1993, (ii) whose Salaried Plan Pension is vested during 1993 (or would become vested in 1994 if his

Service included the assumed period of continued service specified in (a)(1) below), and (iii) whose minimum 1993

Pension in subsection (a) below is not derived solely from that portion of the Plan described in (c) of Article X. In

determining the amount of the 1993 and 1994 Pension amounts for any such individual, the provisions set forth in

subsections (a) and (b) below shall apply.

(a) Minimum 1993 Pension: Any individual who is covered by this section shall accrue a

minimum 1993 Pension as of December 31, 1993. In determining the amount of such individual’s minimum

1993 Pension, the following shall apply.

(1) An individual’s Service and Credited Service as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to

equal the respective Service and Credited Service he would have if his Service continued through

December 31, 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the assumed period of continued Service

shall be less to the extent the Corporation’s human resource records on December 31, 1993 reflect a

scheduled termination date in 1994 for such individual. In this case, the individual’s assumed period of

continued service shall be the portion of 1994 that ends with such scheduled termination date.

(2) An individual’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings as of the end of 1993 shall be

adjusted by the actuary’s salary scale assumption which is

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 78 -

used under the Salaried Plan, so that they equal the amount such scale projects for the individual as of

the end of 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following special rules shall apply.

(i) A higher salary scale assumption shall be used for anyone whose projected

1994 earnings as reflected on the “Special PEP Salary Scale” of the PepsiCo Benefits

Department on December 31, 1993 are higher than would be assumed under the first sentence

of this paragraph. In this case, the individual’s 1993 earnings shall be adjusted using such

higher salary scale.

(ii) In the case of an individual whose assumed period of service under paragraph

(1) above is less than all of 1994, the salary adjustment under the preceding provisions of this

paragraph shall be reduced to the amount that would apply if the individual had no earnings

after his scheduled termination date.

(3) An individual’s attained age as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to be the age he

would have at the end of the assumed period of continued service applicable under paragraph (1)

above.

Any individual who is covered by this section, and who is not otherwise vested as of December 31, 1993, shall

be vested as of such date in both his Pension (determined without regard to this subsection) and his minimum

1993 Pension. For purposes of this subsection, Code section 401(a)(17) shall be applied in 1993 by giving

effect to the amendments to such Code section made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Amendments of

1993.

(b) Determination of 1994 Accrual: If a participant in the Salaried Plan accrues a minimum 1993

Pension under subsection (a) above, the amount of any Pre-409A Pension for 1994 that accrues shall be only

the amount by which the P Pension that would otherwise accrue for 1994 exceeds his minimum 1993 Pension

under

subsection (a).

ARTICLE B

Plan Document Applicable to Pre-2005 Participants

B.1 Scope: This Article supplements the main portion of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document with

respect to the rights and benefits of Pre-2005 Participants.

B.2 Definitions: Words or phrases appearing in this Article with initial capitals shall have the meaning

set forth in the main body of the Plan.

B.3 Applicability of Plan Document: Except as set forth in subsection B.4 below, the provisions of the

Plan shall apply in all respects to Pre-2005 Participants.

B.4 Determination of Pre-2005 Participant Benefit: If a Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a

Pre-2005 Participant, the following Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 contained in this Section B.4 shall replace Sections 5.1,

5.2 and 5.3 of the main Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document, and the amount of the Pre-2005 Participant’s Pension

shall be determined under Section 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 below (whichever is applicable), subject to any adjustments

required under Sections 4.6(b), 5.4 and 5.5 of the main Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document :

“5.1 PEP Pension:

(a) Same Form as Salaried Plan: If a Pre-2005 Participant’s Pension will be paid in the same

form and will commence as of the same time as his pension under the Salaried Plan, then his Pension

hereunder shall be the difference between:

(1) His Total Pension expressed in such form and payable as of such time, minus

(2) His Salaried Plan Pension expressed in such form and payable as of such time.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 81 -

(b) Different Form than Salaried Plan: If a Pre-2005 Participant’s Pension will be paid in a

different form (whether in whole or in part) or will commence as of a different time than his pension under the

Salaried Plan, his Pension shall be the product of:

(1) The amount of the Pre-2005 Participant’s Total Pension expressed in the form and

payable as of such time as applies to his Pension under this Plan, multiplied by

(2) A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of his Total Pension reduced by the

value of his Salaried Plan Pension, and the denominator of which is the value of his Total Pension (with

value determined on a reasonable and consistent basis, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, with

respect to similarly situated employees).

(c) Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

(1) A Pre-2005 Participant’s “Total Pension” means the greater of:

(i) The amount of the Pre-2005 Participant’s pension determined under the terms of

the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and

415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and

(B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of the Salaried Plan; or

(ii) The amount (if any) of the Pre-2005 Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined

under Section 5.2.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 82 -

In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated with

reference to the specific form and time of payment that is applicable. If the applicable form of payment

is a lump sum, the Actuarial Equivalent factors in section (2) of the definition of Actuarial Equivalent

shall apply for purposes of subparagraph (i) in lieu of those in the Salaried Plan.

(2) A Pre-2005 Participant’s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Pre-2005

Participant’s pension determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan.

5.2 PEP Guarantee: A Pre-2005 Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be entitled

to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below. In the case of other Pre-2005 Participants, the

PEP Guarantee shall not apply.

(a) Eligibility: A Pre-2005 Participant shall be covered by this section if the Pre-2005 Participant

has 1988 pensionable earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988

pensionable earnings” means the Pre-2005 Participant’s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year, within the

meaning of the Salaried Plan as in effect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration

from an entity attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer.

(b) PEP Guarantee Formula: The amount of a Pre-2005 Participant’s PEP Guarantee shall be

determined under the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).

(1) Formulas: The amount of a Pre-2005 Participant’s Pension under this paragraph shall

be determined in accordance with subparagraph (i)

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 83 -

below. However, if the Pre-2005 Participant was actively employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a

classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1, 1975, the amount of his Pension under this

paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided

that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the amount of a Vested Pension.

(i) Formula A: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:

(A) 3 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’s Highest Average Monthly

Earnings for the first 10 years of Credited Service, plus

(B) 1 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’s Highest Average Monthly

Earnings for each year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less

(C) 1-2/3 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’s Primary Social Security

Amount multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.

In determining the amount of a Vested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be

calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Pre-2005 Participant would have earned

had he remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his

Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Severance from

Service Date, and then shall be reduced by multiplying

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 84 -

the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Pre-2005 Participant’s actual

years of Credited Service on his Severance from Service Date and the denominator of which is

the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he remained in the employ of an

Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.

(ii)    Formula B: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater

of (A) or (B) below:

(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number

of years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’s Primary Social

Security Amount, or

(B)    3 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of

years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’s

Primary Social Security Amount.

In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be

calculated on the basis of the Pre-2005 Participant’s Credited Service (determined in accordance with

Section 3.3(d)(3) of the Salaried Plan), and his Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social

Security Amount at the date of disability.

(2) Calculation: The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to

paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 85 -

(i) Surviving Eligible Spouse’s Annuity: Subject to subparagraph (iii) below and the

last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Pre-2005 Participant has an Eligible Spouse, the Pre-

2005 Participant’s Eligible Spouse shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50

percent of the Pre-2005 Participant’s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding

reduction in such Annuity for the Pre-2005 Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible

Spouse shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Pre-2005

Participant’s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible

Spouse’s death. If the Eligible Spouse is more than 10 years younger than the Pre-2005

Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided

below.

(A) For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving

Eligible Spouse is younger than the Pre-2005 Participant, the survivor benefit payable to

such spouse shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.

(B) For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse is

younger than the Pre-2005 Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall

be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.

(ii) Reductions: The following reductions shall apply in determining a Pre-2005

Participant’s PEP Guarantee.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 86 -

(A) If the Pre-2005 Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the

payment amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the

benefit commencement date precedes the date the Pre-2005 Participant would attain his

Normal Retirement Date.

(B) If the Pre-2005 Participant is entitled to a Vested Pension, the payment

amount shall be reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal

Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b)

reductions for any Pre-Retirement Spouse’s coverage shall apply.

(C) This clause applies if the Pre-2005 Participant will receive his Pension in

a form that provides an Eligible Spouse benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving

spouse, that is greater than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Pre-

2005 Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of

the benefit payable on the Pre-2005 Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the

Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of this section.

(D) This clause applies if the Pre-2005 Participant will receive his Pension in

a form that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse. In

this instance,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 87 -

the Pre-2005 Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total

value of the benefit payable on the Pre-2005 Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial

Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the Pre-2005 Participant’s life.

(E) This clause applies if the Pre-2005 Participant will receive his Pension in

an Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this

instance, the Pre-2005 Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that

the total value of the benefit payable on the Pre-2005 Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial

Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.

(iii) Lump Sum Conversion: The amount of the Retirement Pension determined

under this section for a Pre-2005 Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in

the form of a lump sum shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Pre-2005 Participant’s PEP

Guarantee determined under this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit

under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A)

above.

5.3 Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension: The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s

Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under subsection (a) below.

(a) Calculation: An Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension shall be the difference

between:

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 88 -

(1) The Eligible Spouse’s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension, minus

(2) The Eligible Spouse’s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension.

(b) Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

(1) An Eligible Spouse’s “Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension” means the greater of:

(i) The amount of the Eligible Spouse’s pre-retirement spouse’s pension determined

under the terms of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by

sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under

the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of the Salaried Plan;

or

(ii) The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s Pension determined under

subsection (c).

In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated with

reference to the specific time of payment applicable to the Eligible Spouse.

(c) PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension: An Eligible Spouse’s PEP Guarantee

Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below,

whichever is applicable, with reference to

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 89 -

the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the Pre-2005 Participant under Section 5.2.

(1) Normal Rule: The Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension payable under this paragraph

shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity, under a Qualified Joint and

Survivor Annuity, if the Pre-2005 Participant had:

(i) Separated from service on the date of death (or, if earlier, his actual Severance

from Service Date);

(ii) Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date payments

of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension are to commence; and

(iii) Died on the day immediately following such commencement.

If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension under this paragraph commences prior to the date

which would have been the Pre-2005 Participant’s Normal Retirement Date, appropriate reductions for

early commencement shall be applied to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity upon which the Pre-

Retirement Spouse’s Pension is based.

(2) Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees Who Die Prior to June 1, 2009:

Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension paid on behalf of a Pre-2005

Participant described in Section 4.6(a) who dies prior to June 1, 2009 shall not be less than an amount equal

to 25 percent of such Pre-2005 Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under Section 5.2. For this purpose,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 90 -

Credited Service shall be determined as provided in Section 3.3(d)(2) of the Salaried Plan, and the deceased

Pre-2005 Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings, Primary Social Security Amount and Covered

Compensation shall be determined as of his date of death. A Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension under this

paragraph is not reduced for early commencement.”

Appendix.

ARTICLE I – Foreword

The PEP Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PBG for the benefit of salaried

employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried

Plan”). PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by

the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain

eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.

This Plan is first effective April 6, 1999. The Plan is a successor plan to the PepsiCo Pension Equalization

Plan, which was last restated effective as of January 1, 1989. The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan covers eligible

employees at the various divisions of PepsiCo, Inc., including eligible employees who are employed at various Pepsi-

Cola Company facilities. On April 6, 1999, when this Plan became effective, PBG had its initial public offering. PBG

employs many of the individuals employed at Pepsi-Cola Company facilities who were covered under the PepsiCo

Pension Equalization Plan. This initial Plan document closely mirrors the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan

document, including its historical provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under this

Plan.

In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated with

reference to the specific form and time of payment that is applicable. If the applicable form of payment is a

lump sum, the Actuarial Equivalent factors in section (2) of the definition of Actuarial Equivalent in Article II

shall apply for purposes of subparagraph (i) in lieu of those in the Salaried Plan.

(4)    A Participant’s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Participant’s pension

determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan.

5.2    PEP Guarantee: A Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be entitled to a PEP

Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below. In the case of other Participants, the PEP Guarantee shall

not apply.

(a)    Eligibility: A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable

earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings” means the

Participant’s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year that was recognized for benefits received under the Salaried

Plan as in effect in

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 112 -

1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity attributable to any period when that

entity was not an Employer.

(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula: The amount of a Participant’s PEP Guarantee shall be determined under

the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).

(1)    Formulas: The amount of a Participant’s Pension under this paragraph shall be determined

in accordance with subparagraph (i) below. However, if the Participant was actively employed in a

classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1, 1975, the amount of his Pension under this

paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that

subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the amount of a Vested Pension.

(i)    Formula A: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:

(A)    3 percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for the first

10 years of Credited Service, plus

(B)    1 percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for each year

of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less

(C)    1-2/3 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount multiplied

by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.

In determining the amount of a Vested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall

first be calculated on the basis of (I) the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 113 -

Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he remained in the employ of the

Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest Average Monthly Earnings and

Primary Social Security Amount at his Severance from Service Date, and then shall be reduced

by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant’s

actual years of Credited Service on his Severance from Service Date and the denominator of

which is the years of Credited Service he would have earned had he remained in the employ of

an Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.

(ii)    Formula B: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater of (A)

or (B) below:

(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of years

of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount, or

(B)    3 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of years of

Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security

Amount.

In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be

calculated on the basis of the Participant’s Credited Service (determined in accordance with Section

3.3(d)(3) of Part C of the Salaried Plan), and his Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social

Security Amount at the date of disability.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 114 -

(2)    Calculation: The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph

(1) above, subject to the following special rules:

(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’s Annuity: Subject to subparagraph (iii) below and the last

sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an Eligible Spouse and has commenced receipt of

an Annuity under this section, the Participant’s Eligible Spouse shall be entitled to receive a survivor

annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding

reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse shall

begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and shall end with

the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’s death. If the Eligible Spouse is more than 10

years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be

adjusted as provided below.

(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible

Spouse is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be

reduced by 0.8 percent.

(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse is younger

than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse shall be reduced by an

additional 0.4 percent.

(ii)    Reductions: The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’s PEP

Guarantee.

(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment

amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 115 -

for each month by which the benefit commencement date precedes the date the Participant

would attain his Normal Retirement Date.

(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a Vested Pension, the payment amount shall be

reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date (if

payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b) reductions for any Pre-

Retirement Spouse’s coverage shall apply.

(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that

provides an Eligible Spouse benefit, continuing for the life of the surviving spouse, that is greater

than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’s Pension under this

section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf

is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the foregoing provisions of

this section.

(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form that

provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse. In this instance, the

Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit

payable on the Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the

Participant’s life.

(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an Annuity

form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance, the

Participant’s Pension under this

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 116 -

section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf

is the Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such protection.

(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion: The amount of the Retirement Pension determined under

this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum

shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under this section,

taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early

retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.

5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension: The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s

Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under subsection (a) below.

(a)    Calculation: An Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension shall be the difference

between:

(1)    The Eligible Spouse’s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension, minus

(2)    The Eligible Spouse’s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension.

(b)    Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

(1)    An Eligible Spouse’s “Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension” means the greater of:

(i)    The amount of the Eligible Spouse’s pre-retirement spouse’s pension determined

under the terms of the Salaried Plan, but without

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 117 -

regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations

are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section

5.6(d) of Part C of the Salaried Plan; or (ii)    The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’s PEP

Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension determined under subsection (c).

In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated with reference

to the specific time of payment applicable to the Eligible Spouse.

(c)    PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension: An Eligible Spouse’s PEP Guarantee Pre-

Retirement Spouse’s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below, whichever is

applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the Participant under

Section 5.2.

(1)    Normal Rule: The Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension payable under this paragraph shall be

equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity, under a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity,

if the Participant had:

(i)    Separated from service on the date of death (or, if earlier, his actual Severance from

Service Date);

(ii)    Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date payments of

the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension are to commence; and (iii)    Died on the day

immediately following such commencement.

If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension under this paragraph commences prior to the date which

would have been the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 118 -

appropriate reductions for early commencement shall be applied to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity

upon which the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension is based.

(2)    Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees: Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the

Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described in Section 4.6(a) shall not be less

than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under Section 5.2. For

this purpose, Credited Service shall be determined as provided in Section 3.3(d)(2) of Part C of the Salaried

Plan, and the deceased Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings, Primary Social Security Amount and

Covered Compensation shall be determined as of his date of death. A Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension

under this paragraph is not reduced for early commencement.

5.4    Certain Adjustments: Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to

adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a

nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a

member of the PBG Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar

plans includes the PepsiCo Prior Plan).

(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants: This subsection shall apply to a current or former Participant

who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is recalculated based

on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the Participant’s Pre-409A

Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder. For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 5.2 is adjusted for

in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 119 -

under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.

(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans: If the benefit paid under a specified plan on

behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is

by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the PEP benefit for the

Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder, the Plan Administrator shall

take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no

duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.

5.5    Excludable Employment: Effective for periods of employment on or after June 30, 1997, an executive

classified as level 22 or above whose employment by an Employer is for a limited duration assignment shall not

become entitled to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment.

The terms of this Article govern the distribution of benefits to a Participant who becomes entitled to payment of

ARTICLE VI – Distribution Options

a Pension under the Plan.

6.1    Form and Timing of Distributions: This section shall govern the form and timing of distributions of Pre-

409A Pensions that begin on or after March 1, 1992. Plan distributions that begin before that date shall be governed

by Prior Plan as in effect at the time of the distribution. The provisions of this Section 6.1 are in all cases subject to

the cashout rules set forth in Section 4.9.

(a)    No Advance Election: This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who does not have an

Advance Election in effect as of the close of business on the day before his

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 120 -

Retirement Date, or (ii) who terminates employment prior to Retirement. Subject to the next sentence, a Participant

described in this subsection shall be paid his Pre-409A Pension in the same form and at the same time as he is paid

his Pension under the Salaried Plan. If a Participant’s Salaried Plan Annuity Starting Date occurs while he is still an

employee of the PBG Organization (because of the time of payment provisions in Code section 401(a)(9)), payment

under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month next following the Participant’s Severance from Service

Date. In this instance, the form of payment under this Plan shall remain that applicable under the Salaried Plan.

(b)    Advance Election in Effect: This subsection shall apply to a Participant: (i) who has an Advance

Election in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, and (ii) whose Retirement Date is

after 1993. To be in effect, an Advance Election must meet the advance receipt and other requirements of Section

6.3(b).

(1)    Lump Sum Election: If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election to

receive a Single Lump Sum in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, the

Participant’s Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid as a Single Lump Sum as of the first of the

month coincident with or next following his Retirement Date.

(2)    Annuity Election: If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election to

receive an Annuity in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date, the Participant’s

Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid in an Annuity beginning on the first of the month coincident

with or next following his Retirement Date. The following provisions of this paragraph govern the form of

Annuity payable in the case of a Participant described in this paragraph.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 121 -

(i)    Salaried Plan Election: A Participant who has a qualifying Salaried Plan election shall

receive his distribution in the same form of Annuity the Participant selected in such qualifying Salaried

Plan election. For this purpose, a “qualifying Salaried Plan election” is a written election of a form of

payment by the Participant that: (A) is currently in effect under the Salaried Plan as of the close of

business on the day before the Participant’s Retirement Date, and (B) specifies an Annuity as the form

of payment for all or part of the Participant’s Retirement Pension under the Salaried Plan. For purposes

of the preceding sentence, a Participant who elects a combination lump sum and Annuity under the

Salaried Plan is considered to have specified an Annuity for part of his Salaried Plan Pension.

(ii)    PEP Election: A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) and who has a

PEP Election in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date shall receive

his distribution in the form of Annuity the Participant selects in such PEP Election.

(iii)    No PEP Election: A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii) above

shall receive his distribution in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if he is married, or in

the form of a Single Life Annuity if he is not married. For purposes of this subparagraph (iii), a

Participant shall be considered married if he is married on the day before his Retirement Date.

6.2    Available Forms of Payment: The forms of payment set forth in subsections (a) and (b) may be provided

to any Participant who is entitled to a Retirement Pension. The forms

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 122 -

of payment for other Participants are set forth in subsection (c) below. The provisions of this section are effective for

Annuity Starting Dates after 1989 and earlier distributions shall be governed by the Prior Plan as in effect at the time

of distribution.

(a)    Basic Forms of Payment: A Participant’s Retirement Pension shall be distributed in one of the

forms of payment listed in this subsection. The particular form of payment applicable to a Participant shall be

determined in accordance with Section 6.1. Payments shall commence on the date specified in Section 6.1 and shall

end on the date specified in this subsection.

(1)    Single Life Annuity Option: A Participant may receive his Pension in the form of a Single

Life Annuity, which provides monthly payments ending with the last payment due prior to his death.

(2)    Survivor Options: A Participant may receive his Pension in accordance with one of the

following survivor options:

(i)    100 percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable

for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in the same reduced

amount shall continue after the Participant’s death to his beneficiary for life, beginning on the first day of

the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and ending with the last monthly payment

due prior to the beneficiary’s death.

(ii)    75 percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable

for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in the amount of 75

percent of such reduced Pension shall be continued after the Participant’s death to his beneficiary for

life,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 123 -

beginning on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and ending

with the last monthly payment due prior to the beneficiary’s death.

(iii)    50 percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable

for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments in the amount of 50

percent of such reduced Pension shall be continued after the Participant’s death to his beneficiary for

life, beginning on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and

ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the beneficiary’s death. A 50 percent survivor option

under this paragraph shall be a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if the Participant’s beneficiary is his

Eligible Spouse.

(iv)    Ten Years Certain and Life Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension

which shall be payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months. If the retired Participant

dies before 120 payments have been made, the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for the

remainder of the 120 month period to the Participant’s primary beneficiary (or if the primary beneficiary

has predeceased the Participant, the Participant’s contingent beneficiary).

(3)    Single Lump Sum Payment Option: A Participant may receive payment of his Pension in the

form of a Single Lump Sum payment.

(4)    Combination Lump Sum/Monthly Benefit Option: A Participant who does not have an

Advance Election in effect may receive a portion of his Pension in

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 124 -

the form of a lump sum payment, and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits

described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above. The Pension is divided between the two forms of payment based

on the whole number percentages designated by the Participant on a form provided for this purpose by the

Plan Administrator. For the election to be effective, the sum of the two percentages designated by the

Participant must equal 100 percent.

(i)    The amount of the Pension paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by

multiplying: (A) the amount that would be payable to the Participant as a Single Lump Sum payment if

the Participant’s entire benefit were payable in that form, by (B) the percentage that the Participant has

designated for receipt in the form of a lump sum.

(ii)    The amount of the Pension paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by

multiplying: (A) the amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Participant, determined in accordance

with paragraph (1) or (2) above (whichever applies), by (B) the percentage that the Participant has

designated for receipt in the form of a monthly benefit.

(b)    Inflation Protection: The following levels of inflation protection may be provided to any Participant

who is entitled to a Retirement Pension (except to the extent such Pension is paid as a lump sum).

(1)    5 percent Inflation Protection: A Participant’s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced, but

thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 5 percent. The amount of the increase shall

be the difference between inflation in the prior year and 5 percent.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 125 -

(2)    7 percent Inflation Protection: A Participant’s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced, but

thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 7 percent. The amount of the increase shall

be the difference between inflation in the prior year and 7 percent.

Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1, beginning with the second

January 1 following the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date. The amount of inflation in the prior year shall be

determined based on inflation in the 12 month period ending on September 30 of such year, with inflation measured

in the same manner as applies on January 1, 1989 for adjusting Social Security benefits for changes in the cost of

living. Inflation protection that is in effect shall carry over to any survivor benefit payable on behalf of a Participant,

and shall increase the otherwise applicable survivor benefit as provided above. Any election by a Participant to

receive inflation protection shall be irrevocable by such Participant or his surviving beneficiary.

(c)    Available Options for Vested Benefits: The forms of payment available for a Participant with a

Vested Pension are a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for married Participants and a Single Life Annuity for both

married and unmarried Participants. The applicable form of payment shall be determined in accordance with Section

6.1(a).

6.3    Procedures for Elections: This section sets forth the procedures for making Advance Elections and PEP

Elections.

(a)    In General: To qualify as an Advance Election or PEP Election for purposes of Section 6.1, an

election must be made in writing, on the form designated by the Plan Administrator, and must be signed by the

Participant. These requirements also apply to

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 126 -

any revocations of such elections. Spousal consent is not required for any election (or revocation of election) under

the Plan.

(b)    Advance Election: To qualify as an Advance Election, an election must be made under this Plan on

or after July 15, 1993 and meet the following requirements.

(1)    Election: The Participant shall designate on the Advance Election form whether the

Participant elects to take his Pension in the form of an Annuity or a Single Lump Sum.

(2)    Receipt by Plan Administrator: The Advance Election must be received by the Plan

Administrator before the start of the calendar year containing the Participant’s Retirement Date, and at least 6

months before that Retirement Date. An election that meets the foregoing requirements shall remain effective

until it is changed or revoked.

(3)    Change or Revocation of Election: A Plan Participant may change an Advance Election by

filing a new Election that meets the foregoing requirements. A Plan Participant may revoke an Advance

Election only by filing a revocation that is received by the Plan Administrator before the start of the calendar

year containing the Plan Participant’s Retirement Date, and at least 6 months before that Retirement Date.

Any Advance Election by a Participant shall be void if the Participant is not entitled to a Retirement Pension.

(c)    PEP Election: A PEP Election may only be made by a Participant who has an Advance Election to

receive an Annuity in effect at the time his PEP Election is received by the Plan Administrator. In determining whether

an Advance Election is in effect for this

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 127 -

purpose, the advance receipt requirement of subsection (b)(2) shall be considered met if it will be met by the

Participant’s proposed Retirement Date.

(1)    Election: The Participant shall designate on the PEP Election form the Annuity form of

benefit the Participant selects from those described in Section 6.2, including the Participant’s choice of inflation

protection, subject to the provisions of this Article VI. The forms of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(3) and

(4) are not available pursuant to a PEP Election.

(2)    Receipt by the Plan Administrator: The PEP Election must be received by the Plan

Administrator no earlier than 90 days before the Participant’s Retirement Date, and no later than the close of

business on the day before the Participant’s Retirement Date. The Participant shall furnish proof of the age of

his beneficiary (including his Eligible Spouse if applicable), to the Plan Administrator by the day before the

Participant’s Retirement Date, for any form of payment which is subject to reduction in accordance with

subsection 6.2(c) above.

A Participant may change his PEP Election by filing a new Election with the Plan Administrator that meets the

foregoing requirements. The Participant’s PEP Election shall become effective at the close of business on the day

before the Participant’s Retirement Date. Any PEP Election by a Participant shall be void if the Participant does not

have an Advance Election in effect at such time.

(d)    Elections Rules for Annuity Starting Dates: When amounts become payable to a Participant in

accordance with Article IV, they shall be payable as of the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date and the election

procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant’s unpaid accruals as of such

Annuity Starting Date,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 128 -

with the following exception. In the case of a Participant who is rehired after his initial Annuity Starting Date and who

(i) is currently receiving an Annuity that remained in pay status upon rehire, or (ii) was previously paid a lump sum

distribution (other than a cashout distribution described in Section 4.9(a)), the Participant’s subsequent Annuity

Starting Date (as a result of his termination of reemployment), and the election procedures at such subsequent

Annuity Starting Date, shall apply only to the portion of his benefit that accrues after his rehire. Any prior accruals that

remain to be paid as of the Participant’s subsequent Annuity Starting Date shall continue to be payable in accordance

with the elections made at his initial Annuity Starting Date.

For purposes of this section, an election shall be treated as received on a particular day if it is: (A) postmarked

that day, or (B) actually received by the Plan Administrator on that day. Delivery under clause (B) must be made by

the close of business, which time is to be determined by the Plan Administrator.

6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options:

(a)    Effect of Certain Deaths: If a Participant makes a PEP Election for a form of payment described in

Section 6.2(a)(2) and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies before

the PEP Election becomes effective, the election shall be disregarded. If the Participant dies after such PEP Election

becomes effective but before his Retirement Pension actually commences, the election shall be given effect and the

amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month

following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant

who has elected the form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant dies: (i) after the PEP

Election has become effective, (ii)

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 129 -

without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary, and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of

payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’s estate. If

payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’s primary or contingent beneficiary and

such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment

shall be paid to such beneficiary’s estate.

(b)    Nonspouse Beneficiaries: If a Participant’s beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse, he may not elect:

(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his nonspouse

beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than he is, or

(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his nonspouse beneficiary

is more than 19 years younger than he is.

6.5    Designation of Beneficiary: A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of

payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on

his death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form or an approved election form filed under the

Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), the

Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary. A Participant (whether

active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his

election is finally effective. The designation of any beneficiary, and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in

accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator. A beneficiary designation shall not be effective unless and

until filed with the Plan Administrator (or for periods before the Effective Date, the Plan

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 130 -

Administrator under the Prior Plan). If no beneficiary is properly designated, then a Participant’s election of a

survivor’s option described in Section 6.2(a)(2) shall not be given effect.

employed by the PBG Organization on December 31, 1993, (ii) whose Salaried Plan Pension was vested during 1993

(or would have become vested in 1994 if his Service after 1993 included the assumed period of continued service

specified in (a)(1) below), and (iii) whose minimum 1993 Pension in subsection (a) below is not derived solely from

that portion of the Plan described in (c) of Article X of the main portion of this Plan document. In determining the

amount of the 1993 and 1994 Pension amounts for any such individual, the provisions set forth in subsections (a) and

(b) below shall apply.

(a)    Minimum 1993 Pension: Any individual who is covered by this section shall accrue a minimum

1993 Pension as of December 31, 1993. In determining the amount of such individual’s minimum 1993 Pension, the

following shall apply.

(1)    An individual’s Service and Credited Service as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to

equal the respective Service and Credited Service he would have if his Service continued through December

31, 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the assumed period of continued Service shall be less to

the extent PepsiCo, Inc.’s human resource records on December 31, 1993 reflected a scheduled termination

date in 1994 for such individual. In this case, the individual’s assumed period of continued service shall be the

portion of 1994 that ends with such scheduled termination date.

(2)    An individual’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings as of the end of 1993 shall be adjusted

by the actuary’s salary scale assumption which is used under the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan – Pre-409A Program

- 133 -

Salaried Plan, so that they equal the amount such scale projects for the individual as of the end of 1994.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following special rules shall apply.

(i)    A higher salary scale assumption shall be used for anyone whose projected 1994

earnings as reflected on the “Special PEP Salary Scale” of the PBG Benefits Department on December

31, 1993 were higher than would be assumed under the first sentence of this paragraph. In this case,

the individual’s 1993 earnings shall be adjusted using such higher salary scale.

(ii)    In the case of an individual whose assumed period of service under paragraph (1)

above is less than all of 1994, the salary adjustment under the preceding provisions of this paragraph

shall be reduced to the amount that would apply if the individual had no earnings after his scheduled

termination date.

(3)    An individual’s attained age as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to be the age he would

have at the end of the assumed period of continued service applicable under paragraph (1) above.

Any individual who is covered by this section, and who is not otherwise vested as of December 31, 1993, shall

be vested as of such date in both his Pension (determined without regard to this subsection) and his minimum

1993 Pension. For purposes of this subsection, Code section 401(a)(17) shall be applied in 1993 by giving

effect to the amendments to such Code section made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Amendments of

1993.

- 134 -

(b)    Determination of Later Accruals: If a participant in the Salaried Plan accrues a minimum 1993

Pension under subsection (a) above, the amount of any Pre-409A Pension that accrues thereafter shall be only the

amount by which the Pre-409A Pension that would otherwise accrue for years after 1993 exceeds his minimum 1993

Pension under subsection (a).

Plan.

(a)    Article: This Article P98 of the Appendix to the Plan.

(b)    Covered Employee: An Employee who does not meet the eligibility requirements for the Salaried

Plan in Part C of the Salaried Plan document.

(c)    Effective Date: The date the provisions of this Article are effective, which shall be February 1,

P98.3    Amount and Form of Retirement Pension: In lieu of any benefits he would otherwise be entitled to

under this Plan, a Covered Employee shall receive a single lump sum benefit as soon as administratively practical

following his Severance Date. No other benefits under this Plan are payable to a Participant who is entitled to a

benefit under this section. The amount of such lump sum shall be the excess of:

(a)    The Actuarial Equivalent present value of the Covered Employee’s Total Pension (as defined in

Section 5.1(c)) determined as of his Severance Date, for this purpose treating the Covered Employee as eligible for

the Salaried Plan Special Early Retirement Benefit, and treating the benefit as commencing on his Severance Date;

over

(b)    The Actuarial Equivalent present value of the Covered Employee’s Salaried Plan Pension (as

defined in Section 5.1(c)) determined as of his Severance Date, for this purpose determining the benefit without

regard to this Appendix, and treating the benefit as commencing on his Normal Retirement Date.

For purposes of this calculation, amounts shall be determined as of the Participant’s Severance Date,

“Actuarial Equivalent” shall be based on the factors in effect on such date using the definition in section (2) of

Actuarial Equivalent for lump sums conversions, and the Participant shall be treated as taking his Total Pension in the

form of a Single Life Annuity. In the case of a Covered Employee who is eligible for a PEP Guarantee (as defined in

Section 5.2), and for purposes of subsection (a) only, the reduction factors for early commencement of a PEP

Guarantee under Section 5.2 of this Plan shall apply in lieu of those in the Salaried Plan Special Early Retirement

Benefit formula if they provide a greater PEP benefit.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- v -

ARTICLE I

Foreword

The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP” or “Plan”) has been established by PepsiCo for the

benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the Salaried Plan. PEP provides

benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based

on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see, for example, Part B thereof).

1989 Restatement. The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety in 1989.

409A Program Document 2005 Restatement. The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety

effective as of January 1, 2005. The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits

that are subject to Section 409A, i.e., generally, benefits that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 or

materially modified within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4) (the “409A Program”).

Amendments to the 2005 Restatement. The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into

this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PBG PEP”), effective at the end of the day on December 31, 2011.

The PBG PEP document that was in effect on April 1, 2009, as amended through January 1, 2011 (the “409A PBG

PEP Document”) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits

that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger, except for certain administrative

provisions that are now governed by the main portion of the 409A PepsiCo PEP Document as is explained in

Appendix Article PBG 409A. There has been no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to

Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”)

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 1 -

under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Documents as a result of the merger or the revisions to the 409A

PepsiCo PEP Document and 409A PBG PEP Document.

2017, 2019, 2021 and 2022 Restatements. This restatement of the 409A Program Document is

effective as of January 1, 2022. Before this restatement, the 409A Program Document was most recently restated

effective as of January 1, 2021, and prior to that, effective as of January 1, 2019, and prior to that, effective as of

January 1, 2017.

Interplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program. All benefits under the Plan that are not subject

to the 409A Program (i.e., generally, benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially

modified thereafter within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for

the Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together, this document and the document for the Pre-409A

Program describe the terms of a single plan. However, amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and

amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of

the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program

amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be sufficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain

exempt from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.

Freeze of the Salaried Plan. In general, the Plan provides benefits that make up for benefits that would

accrue under the Salaried Plan but for certain Code limitations on benefits and compensation that apply to the

Salaried Plan. As a result, a Participant’s accrual of Plan benefits and a Participant’s growing into certain benefit

enhancements (such as more favorable early commencement factors) are generally tied to the Participant’s accrual

of benefits and growing into benefit enhancements under the Salaried Plan. For certain

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 2 -

Participants, there are special provisions in Section 5.2 (the “PEP Guarantee”) or the Appendix that provide a benefit

accrual opportunity that goes beyond providing a make up for the application of Code limitations to the Salaried Plan.

Regardless, however, the freeze on accruals under the Salaried Plan that is effective as of the end of the day on

December 31, 2025 also freezes all accruals under this Plan effective as of that time. In addition, the Salaried Plan’s

operational rules with respect to the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 govern the

ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31, 2025 under this Plan.

ARTICLE II

Definitions and Construction

2.1    Definitions: This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below. Where the

following words and phrases, in boldface and underlined, appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with

initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the

context.

Accrued Benefit: The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance

with Article V, based on the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Credited Service at the date

of determination.

Actuarial Equivalent: Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to

the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination, a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of

the factors set forth below. The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable

under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner. In the event the Plan is amended to provide

new rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless

specifically adopted by the amendment.

(1)    Annuities and Inflation Protection: To determine the amount of a Pension payable in

the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity, as an annuity

with inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity, the Plan Administrator shall select the

factors that are to be used. Effective January 1, 2009, the factors selected by the Plan Administrator

are set forth in Schedule 1, below (prior factors appear in the Appendix). Thereafter, the Plan

Administrator shall review

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 4 -

such factors for forms of payment (including for annuities and lump sums) from time to time and shall

amend such factors in its discretion. In general, a Participant shall have no right to have any of the

actuarial factors specified for forms of payment under the Plan from time to time applied to his benefit

(or any portion thereof), except to the extent that a particular factor is currently in effect at the time it is

to be applied under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly intended and binding upon

Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment selected by the Plan Administrator from

time-to-time may be applied retroactively to already accrued benefits, and without regard to the

actuarial factors that may have applied previously for such purpose. However, in adjusting benefits

under the Plan using those factors in Schedule 1 (below) that become effective for Annuity Starting

Dates on or after January 1, 2019, the right to receive a benefit that is not less than would have applied

under the prior basis for this adjustment shall apply to the same extent (and in the same manner) as

applies under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors. For this purpose, the

phrase “2019 Salaried Plan Factors” refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan’s

definition of “Actuarial Equivalent” effective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried

Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. Effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a

Participant elects a survivor, period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation

protection, Schedule 1(b) shall apply to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit, period

certain or other death benefit, and Schedule 1(c) or (d) shall apply solely to adjust for the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 5 -

elected inflation protection (for this purpose and as applies generally when determining an Actuarial

Equivalent, the adjustment resulting from applying these factors from separate Schedules shall be

determined using an actuarial computation method that is reasonable and applied consistently to

similarly situated participants).

(2)    Lump Sums: To determine the lump sum value of a Pension, a Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s Pension under Section 4.6, or a Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension under Section

4.12, the lump sum equivalent factors currently applicable to lump sum distributions under the Salaried

Plan shall apply (disregarding transition factors). These factors are subject to change in accordance

with paragraph (1) above.

(3)    Other Cases: To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or

on behalf of a Participant in other cases, the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the

Salaried Plan. In this respect,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 6 -

the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors shall be effective hereunder for Annuity Starting Dates (as defined

under this Plan) on or after January 1, 2019. These factors are subject to change in accordance with

paragraph (1) above.

Annuity: A Pension payable as a series of monthly payments for at least the life of the

Participant.

Annuity Starting Date: The Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the first period for

which an amount is payable under this Plan as an annuity or in any other form. A Participant who: (1) is

reemployed after his initial Annuity Starting Date, and (2) is entitled to benefits hereunder after his

reemployment, shall have a subsequent Annuity Starting Date for such benefits only to the extent provided in

Section 6.3(b).

Cashout Limit: The annual dollar limit on elective deferrals under Code section 402(g)(1)(B), as

in effect from time to time.

Code: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. All references herein

to particular Code Sections shall also refer to any successor provisions and shall include all related

regulations, interpretations and other guidance.

Company: PepsiCo, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of

North Carolina or its successor or successors.

Covered Compensation: “Covered Compensation” as that term is defined in Part B of the

Salaried Plan.

Credited Service: The period of a Participant’s employment, calculated in accordance with

Section 3.3, which is counted for purposes of determining the amount of benefits payable to, or on behalf of,

the Participant.

defined in the Part B of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to the limitation imposed by section 401(a)(17) of

the Code (as such limitation is interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing,

to the extent that a Participant receives, during a leave of absence, earnings that would be counted as Highest

Average Monthly Earnings if they were received during a period of active service, but that will be received after

the Participant’s Separation from Service, the Plan Administrator may provide for determining the Participant’s

409A Pension at Separation from Service by projecting the benefit the Participant would have if all such

earnings were taken into account under the Plan.

Key Employee:

The individuals identified in accordance with the following paragraphs.

(1)    In General. Any Participant who at any time during the applicable year is:

(i)    An officer of any member of the PepsiCo Organization having annual

compensation greater than $130,000 (as adjusted for the applicable year under Code Section

416(i)(1));

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 11 -

(ii)    A 5-percent owner of any member of the PepsiCo Organization; or

(iii)    A 1-percent owner of any member of the PepsiCo Organization having annual

compensation of more than $150,000.

For purposes of subparagraph (i) above, no more than 50 employees identified in the order of their

annual compensation shall be treated as officers. For purposes of this Section, annual compensation

means compensation as defined in Treas. Reg. §1.415(c)-2(a), without regard to Treas. Reg.

§§1.415(c)-2(d), 1.415(c)-2(e), and 1.415(c)-2(g). The Plan Administrator shall determine who is a Key

Employee in accordance with Code Section 416(i) (provided, that Code Section 416(i)(5) shall not apply

in making such determination), and provided further than the applicable year shall be determined in

accordance with Section 409A and that any modification of the foregoing definition that applies under

Section 409A shall be taken into account.

(2)    Applicable Year. Effective from and after December 31, 2007, the Plan Administrator

shall identify Key Employees as of the last day of each calendar year, based on compensation for such

year, and such designation shall be effective for purposes of this Plan for the twelve-month period

commencing on April 1  of the next following calendar year (e.g., the Key Employee identification by

st

the Plan Administrator as of December 31, 2008 shall be effective for the period from April 1, 2009 to

March 31, 2010).

(3)    Rule of Administrative Convenience. Effective beginning with the December 31,

2017 identification date, in addition to the foregoing,

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 12 -

the Plan Administrator shall treat all other employees classified as Leadership Group 6 and above on

the applicable identification date prescribed in paragraph (2) as Key Employees effective for the

twelve-month period commencing on April 1  of the next following calendar year (however, from the

st

April 1, 2008 effective date through February 25, 2010, Band IV and above applied in lieu of

Leadership Group 6 and above); provided that if this would result in counting more than 200 individuals

as Key Employees as of any such determination date, then the number treated as Key Employees will

be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees otherwise added by this

paragraph (3) in order by their base compensation, from the lowest to the highest.

(4)    Identification of Key Employees Between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010.

For the period between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010, Key Employees shall be identified by

combining the lists of Key Employees of all members of the PepsiCo Organization as in effect

immediately prior to February 26, 2010. The foregoing method of identifying Key Employees is

intended to comply with Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(i)(6)(i), which authorizes the use of an alternative

method of identifying specified employees that complies with Treas. Reg. §§ 1.409A-1(i)(5) and -1(i)(8)

and Section VII.C.4.d of the Preamble to the Final Regulations under Section 409A of the Code, which

permits “service recipients to simply combine the pre-transaction separate lists of specified employees

where it is determined that such treatment would be administratively less burdensome.”

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 13 -

(5)    Identification of Key Employees from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2018.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the 12-month periods beginning on the April 1, 2010 effective date

through March 31, 2018, Key Employees shall be identified as follows:

(i)    For the period that begins on April 1, 2010, and ends on March 31, 2011, an

employee shall be a Key Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if he was classified as at

least a Band IV or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this purpose, an employee shall be

considered to be at least a Band IV or its equivalent as of a date if the employee is classified as

one of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Organization on that date: (i) a Band IV

employee or above in a PepsiCo Business, (ii) a Level E7 employee or above in a PBG

Business, or (iii) a Salary Grade 19 employee or above at a PAS Business.

(ii)    For the twelve-month period that begins on April 1, 2011, and for each twelve-

month period that begins on April 1 in subsequent years through March 31, 2017, an employee

shall be a Key Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if the employee was an employee

of the PepsiCo Organization who was classified as Band IV or above on the December 31 that

immediately precedes such April 1.

(iii)    For the period covered by this paragraph (5) notwithstanding the rule of

administrative convenience in paragraph (3) above, an employee shall be a Key Employee for

the 12-month period that begins on any April 1, if as of the preceding December 31 the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 14 -

employee would be a specified employee, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-

1(i), or any successor, by applying as of such December 31 the default rules that apply under

such regulation for determining the minimum number of a service recipient’s specified

employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods for identifying Key Employees set forth in

subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together, would result in more than 200 individuals being

counted as Key Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of

individuals treated as Key Employees pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described

in the first sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from

consideration those employees otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base

compensation, from the lowest base compensation to the highest.

(iv)    For purposes of this paragraph (5), “PAS Business” means each employer,

division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company

classifies as part of the PAS business; “PBG Business” means each employer, division of an

employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part

of the PBG business; and “PepsiCo Business” means each employer, division of an employer or

other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the

PepsiCo business.

The method for identifying Key Employees set forth in this definition is intended as an alternative method of

identifying Key Employees under Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(i)(5), and

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 15 -

PepsiCo Administration Committee or PAC: The committee that has the responsibility for the

administration and operation of the Plan, as set forth in the Plan, as well as any other duties set forth therein.

As of any time, the Chair of the PAC shall be the person who is then the Company’s Senior Vice President,

Total Rewards, but if such position is vacant or eliminated, the Chair shall be the person who is acting to fulfill

the majority of the duties of the position (or plurality of the duties, if no one is fulfilling a majority), as such

duties existed immediately prior to the vacancy or the position elimination.  The Chair shall appoint the other

members of the PAC, applying the principles set forth in the Guiding Principles Regarding Benefit Plan

Committee Appointments and acting promptly from time to time to ensure that there are four other members of

the PAC, each of whom shall have experience and expertise relevant to the responsibilities of the PAC.  At

least two times each year, the PAC shall prepare a written report of its significant activities that shall be

available to any U.S.-based executive of the Company who is at least a senior vice president.

PepsiCo Organization: The controlled group of organizations of which the Company is a part,

as defined by Code section 414 and regulations issued thereunder. An entity shall be considered a member of

Plan: The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, the Plan set forth herein and in the Pre-409A

Program document(s), as the Plan may be amended from time to time (subject to the limitations on

- 17 -

the Pre-409A Program). The Plan is also sometimes referred to as PEP, or as the PepsiCo Pension Benefit

an old-

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 18 -

age insurance benefit under the provisions of Title II of the Social Security Act, as amended. Such

estimates of the old-age insurance benefit to which a Participant would be entitled at age 65 shall be

based upon the following assumptions:

(i)    That the Participant’s social security wages in any year prior to Retirement or

Separation from Service are equal to the Taxable Wage Base in such year, and

(ii)    That he will not receive any social security wages after Retirement or

Separation from Service.

However, in computing a Vested Pension under Formula A of Section 5.2, the estimate of the old-age

insurance benefit to which a Participant would be entitled at age 65 shall be based upon the assumption

that he continued to receive social security wages until age 65 at the same rate as the Taxable Wage

Base in effect at his Separation from Service. For purposes of this subsection, “social security wages”

shall mean wages within the meaning of the Social Security Act.

(2)    For purposes of determining the amount of a Disability Pension, the Primary Social

Security Amount shall be (except as provided in the next sentence) the initial monthly amount actually

Disability Pension before receiving a

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 19 -

disability insurance benefit under the provisions of Title II of the Social Security Act, then the

Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount for such period shall be determined pursuant to

paragraph (1) above.

(3)    For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the Primary Social Security Amount shall

exclude amounts that may be available because of the spouse or any dependent of the Participant or

any amounts payable on account of the Participant’s death. Estimates of Primary Social Security

Amounts shall be made on the basis of the Social Security Act as in effect at the Participant’s

Separation from Service, without regard to any increases in the social security wage base or benefit

levels provided by such Act which take effect thereafter.

Prohibited Misconduct: Any of the following activities engaged in, directly or indirectly, by a

Participant shall constitute Prohibited Misconduct:

(1)    The Participant accepting any employment, assignment, position or responsibility, or

acquiring any ownership interest, which involves the Participant’s “Participation” (as defined below) in a

competing with the PepsiCo Organization.

(3)    The Participant using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding

the PepsiCo Organization other than as necessary in his or her position with the PepsiCo Organization.

include non-public information about the PepsiCo Organization’s customers, suppliers, distributors and

potential acquisition targets; its business operations and structure; its product lines, formulas and

(4)    The Participant engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the

PepsiCo Organization’s best interests, including violating the Company’s Code of Conduct, engaging in

unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or of any other company based on information gained

as a result of his or her employment with the PepsiCo Organization, or engaging in any other activity

which constitutes gross misconduct.

(5)    The Participant engaging in any activity that constitutes fraud.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Participant

from communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the

Company, participating in government investigations, and/or receiving any applicable award for providing

information to government authorities. The Company nonetheless asserts and does not waive its

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 21 -

attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege. Further, pursuant to the

Defend Trade Secrets Act, an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state

trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local

government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or

investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or

other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an

employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the

individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document

containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court

order. For purposes of this subsection, “Participation” shall be construed broadly to include: (i) serving as a

director, officer, employee, consultant or contractor with respect to such a business entity; (ii) providing input,

advice, guidance or suggestions to such a business entity; or (iii) providing a recommendation or testimonial

on behalf of such a business entity or one or more products it produces. For purposes of this subsection,

“Covered Products” shall mean any product that falls into one or more of the following categories, so long as

the PepsiCo Organization is producing, marketing, selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world –

beverages, including without limitation carbonated soft drinks, tea, water, juice drinks, sports drinks, coffee

drinks and value-added dairy drinks; juices and juice products; snacks, including salty snacks, sweet snacks

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 22 -

pancake syrups; value-added pasta products; ready-to-eat cereals; dry pasta products; or any product or

service that the Participant had reason to know was under development by the PepsiCo Organization during

the Participant’s employment with the PepsiCo Organization.

Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity: An Annuity which is payable to the Participant for life

with 50 percent of the amount of such Annuity payable after the Participant’s death to his surviving Eligible

Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner for life. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner (as applicable)

predeceases the Participant, no survivor benefit under a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity shall be payable

to any person. The amount of a Participant’s monthly payment under a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity

shall be reduced to the extent provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, as applicable.

Retirement: Separation from Service for reasons other than death after a Participant has fulfilled

the requirements for either a Normal, Early, Late, or Disability Retirement Pension under Article IV.

Salaried Plan: The program of pension benefits set forth in Part B of the PSERP Component of

both the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (“PERP-A”) the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I

(“PERP-I”), and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan H (“PERP-H”), as it may be amended from time to

time, and as it was set forth prior to January 1, 2017 in predecessor plans to PERP-A and PERP-I.

Section 409A: Section 409A of the Code.

Separation from Service: A Participant’s separation from service with the PepsiCo

Organization, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). The term may also be used as a verb (i.e.,

“Separates from Service”) with no change in meaning. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’s

transfer to an entity owned 20% or more by the Company will not constitute a Separation of Service to the

extent permitted by Section 409A. A Participant’s “Final Separation from Service” is the date of his Separation

from Service that most recently precedes his Annuity Starting Date; provided, however, that to the extent a

Participant is reemployed after an Annuity Starting Date, he will have a new Final Separation from Service with

respect to any benefits to which he becomes entitled as a result of his reemployment. The following principles

shall generally apply in determining when a Separation from Service occurs:

(1)    A Participant separates from service with the Company if the Employee dies, retires,

or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company. Whether a termination of

employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and circumstance indicate that the

Company and the Employee reasonably anticipated that no further services would be performed after a

certain date or that the level of bona fide services

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 24 -

the Employee would perform after such date (as an employee or independent contractor) would

permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed

over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period in which the Employee provided

services to the Company if the Employee has been providing services for less than 36 months).

(2)    An Employee will not be deemed to have experienced a Separation from Service if

such Employee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, to the extent such

leave does not exceed a period of six months or, if longer, such longer period of time during which a

right to re-employment is protected by either statute or contract. If the period of leave exceeds six

months and the individual does not retain a right to re-employment under an applicable statute or by

contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following

such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any

medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be

expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, where such impairment causes the

Employee to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially

similar position of employment, a 29-month period of absence may be substituted for such six-month

period.

(3)    If an Employee provides services both an as employee and as a member of the

Board of Directors of the Company, the services

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 25 -

provided as a Director are generally not taken into account in determining whether the Employee has

Separated from Service as an Employee for purposes of the Plan, in accordance with final regulations

under Section 409A.

Service: The period of a Participant’s employment calculated in accordance with Section 3.2 for

purposes of determining his entitlement to benefits under the Plan.

Single Life Annuity: A level monthly Annuity payable to a Participant for his life only, with no

survivor benefits to his Eligible Spouse or any other person.

Single Lump Sum: The distribution of a Participant’s total 409A Pension in the form of a single

payment, which payment shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s 409A Pension as of the

Participant’s Normal Retirement Date (or Late Retirement Date, if applicable), but not less than the Actuarial

Equivalent of the Participant’s 409A Pension as of the Participant’s Early Retirement Date, in the case of a

Participant who is entitled to an immediate Early 409A Retirement Pension.

Social Security Act: The Social Security Act of the United States, as amended, an enactment

providing governmental benefits in connection with events such as old age, death and disability. Any reference

herein to the Social Security Act (or any of the benefits provided thereunder) shall be taken as a reference to

any comparable governmental program of another country, as determined by the Plan Administrator, but only

to the extent the Plan Administrator judges the computation of those benefits to be administratively feasible.

Taxable Wage Base: The contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the

Social Security Act) in effect for the Plan Year.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 26 -

Vested Pension: The Pension available to a Participant under Section 4.3. The term “409A

Vested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a Vested Pension that is derived from the 409A

Program. The term “Pre-409A Vested Pension” shall be used to refer to the portion of a Vested Pension that is

derived from the Pre-409A Program.

2.2    Construction: The terms of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with this section.

(a)    Gender and Number: Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, (i) a reference to

one or more genders shall include a reference to all the other genders, and (ii) the singular may include the

plural, and the plural may include the singular.

(b)    Compounds of the Word “Here”: The words “hereof”, “hereunder” and other similar

compounds of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire Plan, not to any particular provision or

section.

(c)    Examples: Whenever an example is provided or the text uses the term “including” followed

by a specific item or items, or there is a passage having a similar effect, such passages of the Plan shall be

construed as if the phrase “without limitation” followed such example or term (or otherwise applied to such

passage in a manner that avoids limits on its breadth of application).

(d)    Subdivisions of the Plan Document: This Plan document is divided and subdivided using

the following progression: articles, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, and sub-

clauses. Articles are designated by capital roman numerals. Sections are designated by Arabic numerals

containing a decimal

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 27 -

point. Subsections are designated by lower-case letters in parentheses. Paragraphs are designated by Arabic

numerals in parentheses. Subparagraphs are designated by lower-case roman numerals in parentheses.

Clauses are designated by upper-case letters in parentheses. Sub-clauses are designated by upper-case

roman numerals in parentheses. Any reference in a section to a subsection (with no accompanying section

ARTICLE III

Participation and Service

3.1    Participation: An Employee shall be a Participant in the Plan during the period:

(a)    When he would be currently entitled to receive a Pension under the Plan if his employment

terminated at such time, or

(b)    When he would be so entitled but for the vesting requirement of Section 4.7.

It is expressly contemplated that an Employee, who is entitled to receive a Pension under the Plan as of a particular

time, may subsequently cease to be entitled to receive a Pension under the Plan. An individual’s entitlement to

receive a Pension under the Plan is subject to all exclusions from eligibility that apply under the Salaried Plan and,

therefore, all such exclusions shall be given effect in determining eligibility under the Plan.

3.2    Service: A Participant’s entitlement to a Pension or, in the event the Participant dies before

commencing a benefit hereunder, either a Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension for his Eligible Spouse or a Pre-

Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension for his Eligible Domestic Partner, shall be determined under Article IV based

upon his period of Service. A Participant’s period of Service shall be determined under Article III of Part B of the

Salaried Plan, except as provided in (a) below.

(a) Inpats. Any Salaried Plan provision which results in disregarding for certain purposes the pre-

transfer Service of certain inpats who transfer to the United States, shall not

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 29 -

apply to this Plan before January 1, 2015, unless such earlier application avoids duplication of benefits.

(b)    Leaves of Absence. If a Participant’s period of Service (as so determined) would extend beyond

the Participant’s Separation from Service date because of a leave of absence, the Plan Administrator may provide for

determining the Participant’s 409A Pension at Separation from Service by projecting the benefit the Participant would

have if all such Service were taken into account under the Plan.

3.3    Credited Service: Subject to the next two sentences, the amount of a Participant’s Pension, Pre-

Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension shall be based upon the Participant’s

period of Credited Service, as determined under Article III of Part B of the Salaried Plan.

(a)    Inpats. Any provision in Section 3.5 of Part B of the Salaried Plan which resulted in

disregarding the pre-transfer Credited Service of certain inpats who transferred to the United States shall not

apply under this Plan in the case of such inpats who transfer to the United States before October 1, 2014,

unless such earlier application avoids duplication of benefits under the Salaried Plan.

(b)    Leaves of Absence. If a Participant’s period of Credited Service (as so determined) would

extend beyond the Participant’s Separation from Service date because of a leave of absence, the Plan

Administrator may provide for determining the Participant’s 409A Pension at Separation from Service by

projecting the benefit the Participant would have if all such Service were taken into account under the Plan.

ARTICLE IV

Requirements for Benefits

A Participant shall be eligible to receive a Pension and a surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible

Domestic Partner, as applicable, shall be eligible for certain survivor benefits as provided in this Article. The amount

of any such Pension or survivor benefit shall be determined in accordance with Article V.

4.1    Normal 409A Retirement Pension: A Participant shall be eligible for a Normal 409A Retirement

Pension if he Separates from Service after attaining Normal Retirement Age.

4.2    Early 409A Retirement Pension: A Participant shall be eligible for an Early 409A Retirement

Pension if he Separates from Service prior to attaining Normal Retirement Age but after attaining at least age 55 and

completing 10 or more years of Elapsed Time Service.

4.3    409A Vested Pension: A Participant who is vested under Section 4.7 shall be eligible to receive a

409A Vested Pension if he Separates from Service before he is eligible for a Normal 409A Retirement Pension or an

Early 409A Retirement Pension. A Participant who terminates employment prior to satisfying the vesting requirement

in Section 4.7 shall not be eligible to receive a Pension under this Plan.

4.4    Late 409A Retirement Pension: A Participant who continues without a Separation from Service

after his Normal Retirement Age shall not receive a Pension until his Late Retirement Date. Thereafter, a Participant

shall be eligible for a Late Retirement Pension determined in accordance with Section 4.4 of Part B of the Salaried

Plan (but without regard to

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 31 -

any requirement for notice of suspension under ERISA section 203(a)(3)(B) or any adjustment as under

Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan).

4.5    409A Disability Pension: A Participant shall be eligible for a 409A Disability Pension if he meets

the requirements for a Disability Pension under Part B of the Salaried Plan. A Participant’s 409A Disability Pension, if

any, shall generally be comprised of two parts. The first part shall represent the benefits with respect to a disabled

Participant’s Credited Service through the day of the Participant’s Separation from Service (i.e., the Participant’s “Pre-

Separation Accruals”). In the event the disabled Participant continues to receive Credited Service related to the

disability after such Separation from Service, the Participant’s 409A Disability Pension shall have a second part,

which shall represent all benefits accrued with respect to Credited Service from the date immediately following the

Participant’s Separation from Service until the earliest of the Participant’s (i) attainment of age 65, (ii) benefit

commencement date under Part B of the Salaried Plan or (iii) recovery from the disability (i.e., the Participant’s “Post-

LTD Accruals”).

4.6    Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension: A Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension is payable

under this section only in the event the Participant dies prior to his Annuity Starting Date. Any Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s 409A Pension payable on behalf of a Participant shall commence as of the first day of the month following

the later of (i) the Participant’s death and, (ii) the date the Participant attains or would have attained age 55. Subject

to Section 4.9, any Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension shall continue monthly for the life of the Eligible Spouse.

(a)    Active, Disabled and Retired Employees: A Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension shall

be payable under this subsection to a Participant’s Eligible

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 32 -

Spouse (if any) who is entitled under Part B of the Salaried Plan to the pre-retirement spouse’s pension for

survivors of active, disabled and retired employees. The amount (if any) of such Pension shall be determined

in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 (with the 409A Pension, if any, determined after application of

Section 5.6).

(b)    Vested Employees: A Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension shall be payable under this

subsection to a Participant’s Eligible Spouse (if any) who is entitled under Part B the Salaried Plan to the pre-

retirement spouse’s pension for survivors of vested terminated Employees. The amount (if any) of such

Pension shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 (with the 409A Pension, if any,

determined after application of Section 5.6). If pursuant to this Section 4.6(b) a Participant has Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s coverage in effect for his Eligible Spouse, any Pension calculated for the Participant under

Section 5.2(b) shall be reduced for each year such coverage is in effect by the applicable percentage set forth

below (based on the Participant’s age at the time the coverage is in effect) with a pro rata reduction for any

portion of a year. No reduction shall be made for coverage in effect within the 90-day period following a

Participant’s termination of employment.

4.7    Vesting: Subject to Section 8.7 (Section 457A), a Participant shall be fully vested in, and have a

nonforfeitable right to, his Accrued Benefit at the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under Part B of

the Salaried Plan.

4.8    Time of Payment: The distribution of a Participant’s 409A Pension shall commence as of the time

specified in Section 6.1, subject to Section 6.6. Any increase in a Participant’s 409A Pension or Pre-409A Pension for

interest due to a delay in payment, by application of Section 3.1(e) of Part A of the Salaried Plan (delay in payment)

when calculating either portion of the Participant’s Pension, shall accrue entirely under the 409A Program and be

paid (subject to the last sentence of this Section) at the same time and in the same form that the Participant’s 409A

Pension is paid. Accordingly, if a Participant is entitled to an interest adjustment for a delay in payment of his Pre-

409A Pension, such interest adjustment shall be limited to that which may be paid as part of the Participant’s 409A

Pension, consistent with 409A’ s payment rules and the limitation in the next sentence. Notwithstanding any provision

of the Salaried Plan to the contrary, including such Section 3.1(e) of Part A, a Participant shall not receive interest for

any delay in payment of his 409A Pension or Pre-409A Pension to the extent the delay is caused by the Participant or

interest is prohibited by the terms of an Internal Revenue Service correction program regarding compliance with Code

section 409A.

4.9    Cashout Distributions: Notwithstanding the availability or applicability of a different form of

payment under Article VI, the following rules shall apply in the case of certain small benefit Annuity payments:

(a)    Distribution of Participant’s 409A Pension: If at a Participant’s Annuity Starting Date the

Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of the Participant’s 409A Pension is equal to or less than the Cashout

Limit, the Plan Administrator shall distribute

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 34 -

to the Participant such lump sum value of the Participant’s 409A Pension. Notwithstanding the preceding

sentence, for Annuity Starting Dates prior to December 1, 2012, a Participant shall be cashed out under this

subsection if, at the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date, the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of the

Participant’s PEP Pension is equal to or less than $15,000.

(b)    Distribution of Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension: If at the time payments are to

commence to an Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6, the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of the PEP Pre-

Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension to be paid is equal to or less than the Cashout Limit, the Plan

Administrator shall distribute to the Eligible Spouse such lump sum value of the PEP Pre-Retirement Spouse’s

Pension that is subject to Section 409A. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for Annuity Starting Dates

prior to December 1, 2012, an Eligible Spouse shall be cashed out under this subsection if the Actuarial

Equivalent lump sum value of the Eligible Spouse’s PEP Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension is equal to or less

than $15,000.

(c)    Special Cashout of 409A Vested Pensions: Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Plan

Administrator shall have discretion under this subsection to cash out a 409A Vested Pension in a single lump

sum prior to the date that would apply under subsection (a).

(1)    The Plan Administrator shall have discretion under this subsection to cash out in a

single lump sum any 409A Vested Pension that, as of December 1, 2012 – (i) has not otherwise had its

Annuity Starting Date occur, (ii) has an Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value that is equal to or less

than the Cashout Limit as of such date, and (iii) is practicable to calculate and distribute

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 35 -

(as determined pursuant to the exercise of the Plan Administrator’s discretion), with such cashout

being made on December 1, 2012.

(2)    The Plan Administrator shall also have discretion under this subsection to cash out

in a single lump sum any 409A Vested Pension that, as of the first day of any month in 2013 or a later

year specified by the Plan Administrator pursuant to the exercise of its discretion – (i) has not

otherwise had its Annuity Starting Date occur, (ii) has an Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value that is

equal to or less than the Cashout Limit as of such date, and (iii) is practicable to calculate and

distribute (as determined pursuant to the exercise of the Plan Administrator’s discretion), with such

cashout being made on the first day of the month specified.

Not later than November 30, the Plan Administrator shall memorialize in writing the exercise of its discretion

under this subsection to select Vested Pensions for cashout on December 1, 2012, through the creation of a

written list (in either hard copy or electronic form) of Participants with 409A Vested Pensions who will be

cashed out. In addition, not later than the day before the date specified pursuant to paragraph (2) above, the

Plan Administrator shall memorialize in writing the exercise of its discretion under this subsection to select

Vested Pensions for cashout on the specified date, through the creation of a written list (in either hard copy or

electronic form) of Participants with 409A Vested Pensions who will be cashed out.

(d)    Distribution of Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension. If at the time payments

are to commence to an Eligible Domestic Partner under Section 4.12, the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value

of the Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 36 -

409A Pension to be paid is equal to or less than the Cashout Limit, the Plan Administrator shall distribute to

the Eligible Domestic Partner such Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value of the Pre-Retirement Domestic

Partner’s Pension that is subject to Section 409A.

(e)    Exceptions to the Availability of Cashout. Effective January 1, 2018, a cashout shall not be

available with respect to a Participant who is eligible for either a “PEP Kicker” or a “Qualified Kicker” under a

“Severance Program”. For purposes of this Section 4.9, the quoted terms in the prior sentence shall have the

meanings that they are assigned in Appendix Article E.

Any lump sum distributed under this section shall be in lieu of the Pension that otherwise would be distributable to the

Participant, Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner hereunder. The cashout provisions described in subsections

(a) through (d) above are intended to be “limited cashout” features within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §

1.409A-3(j)(4)(v), and they shall be interpreted and applied consistently with this regulation. Accordingly, in

determining if an applicable dollar limit is satisfied, a Participant’s entire benefit under this Plan that is subject to

Section 409A and all benefits subject to Section 409A under all other nonaccount balance plans (within the meaning

of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(C)) shall be taken into account (the “accountable benefit”), and a

Participant’s entire accountable benefit must be cashed out as of the time in question as a condition to any payout

under this Section. In addition, a cashout under this Section shall not cause an accountable benefit to be paid out

before completing any applicable six-month delay (see, e.g., Section 6.6). No Participant, Eligible Spouse or Eligible

Domestic Partner shall be given a direct or indirect election with respect to whether the Participant’s Vested Pension,

Pre-Retirement Spouse’s

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 37 -

409A Pension or Pre-Retirement Eligible Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension will be cashed out under this section.

4.10    Reemployment of Certain Participants: In the case of a current or former Participant who is

receiving his Pension as an Annuity under Section 6.1(b), and who is reemployed and is eligible to re-participate in

Part B of the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his 409A Pension will continue to be paid in

the same form as it was paid prior to his reemployment. Any additional 409A Pension that is earned by the Participant

shall be paid based on the Separation from Service that follows the Participant’s re-employment.

4.11    Forfeiture of Benefits: Effective beginning with benefits accrued after December 31, 2008 (“Post-

2008 Accruals”), and notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Plan Administrator

determines that a Participant has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his

or her Separation from Service, the Participant shall forfeit all Post-2008 Accruals (whether paid previously, being

paid currently or payable in the future), and his or her 409A Pension shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture and

previously paid Post-2008 Accruals shall be recovered.

4.12    Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension: A Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A

Pension is payable under this section only in the event the Participant dies prior to his Annuity Starting Date under

either the 409A Program or the Pre-409A Program. Any Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension payable

on behalf of a Participant shall commence on the first day of the month following the later of (i) the Participant’s death

and, (ii) the date the Participant attains or would have attained age 55. Subject to Section 4.9, any Pre-

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 38 -

Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension shall continue monthly for the life of the Eligible Domestic Partner.

(a)    Active, Disabled and Retired Employees: A Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A

Pension shall be payable under this subsection to a Participant’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) who is

entitled under Part B of the Salaried Plan to the pre-retirement domestic partner’s pension for survivors of

active, disabled and retired employees. The amount (if any) of such Pension shall be determined in

accordance with the provisions of Section 5.8 (with the 409A Pension, if any, determined after application of

Section 5.6).

(b)    Vested Employees: A Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension shall be payable

under this subsection to a Participant’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) who is entitled under Part B of the

Salaried Plan to the pre-retirement domestic partner’s pension for survivors of vested terminated Employees.

The amount (if any) of such Pension shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.8 (with

the 409A Pension, if any, determined after application of Section 5.6). If, pursuant to this Section 4.12(b), a

Participant has Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension coverage in effect for his Eligible Domestic

Partner, any Pension calculated for the Participant under Section 5.2(b) shall be reduced for each year such

coverage is in effect by the applicable percentage set forth below (based on the Participant’s age at the time

the coverage is in effect) with a pro rata reduction for any portion of a year. No reduction shall be made for

coverage in effect within the 180-day period following a Participant’s termination of employment.

ARTICLE V

Amount of Retirement Pension

When a 409A Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Participant under this Plan, the amount of

such  409A  Pension  shall  be  determined  under  Section  5.1  or  5.3  (whichever  is  applicable),  subject  to  any

adjustments required under Sections 4.6(b) and 5.4 and subject to the freeze of the Plan described in Article I.

5.1    Participant’s 409A Pension: Subject to Section 8.7 (Section 457A), a Participant’s 409A Pension

shall be determined as follows –

(a)    Calculating the 409A Pension: A Participant’s 409A Pension shall be calculated as follows

(on the basis specified in subsection (b) below and using the definitions appearing in subsection (c) below):

(1)    His Total Pension, reduced by

(2)    His Salaried Plan Pension, and then further reduced by (but not below zero)

(3)    His Pre-409A Pension.

(b)    Basis for Determining: The 409A Pension amount in subsection (a) above shall be

determined on a basis that (i) takes into account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of

the Annuity Starting Date of the 409A Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary, the relative value of

forms of payment, and (iii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial

Equivalent, in each such respect as appropriate and customary under the circumstances and in accordance

with rules authorized by the Plan Administrator, including to take account the time and form of any prior

payments and to eliminate all duplication of benefits as

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 41 -

determined by the Plan Administrator, and (iii) effective for Annuity Starting Dates after December 31, 2018,

allows a Participant’s 409A Pension to provide a makeup (as appropriate under the circumstances under rules

authorized by the Plan Administrator) for the application of early commencement reduction factors to the

Participant’s Pre-409A Pension that apply a greater early commencement reduction to such Pre-409A Pension

than would apply under the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors (including with respect to any portion of the

Participant’s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee).

(c)    Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

(1)    A Participant’s “Total Pension” means the greater of:

(i)    The amount of the Participant’s pension determined under the terms of Part B

of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and

415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and

(B) the actuarial adjustment under Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (relating to

benefits that are deferred beyond the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date); or

(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under

Section 5.2.

As necessary to ensure the Participant’s receipt of a “greater of” benefit, the foregoing comparison shall

be made by reflecting, as applicable, the relative value of forms of payment.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 42 -

(2)    A Participant’s “Salaried Plan Pension” means the amount of the Participant’s

pension determined under the terms of Part B of the Salaried Plan.

(3)    A Participant’s “Pre-409A Pension” means the amount of the Participant’s pension

determined under Section 5.6.

5.2    PEP Guarantee: A Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be entitled to a PEP

Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below. In the case of other Participants, the PEP Guarantee shall

not apply.

(a)    Eligibility: A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988

pensionable earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable

earnings” means the Participant’s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year, within the meaning of the Salaried

Plan as in effect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include remuneration from an entity

attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer.

(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula: The amount of a Participant’s PEP Guarantee shall be

determined under the applicable formula in paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).

(1)    Formulas: The amount of a Participant’s Pension under this paragraph shall be

determined in accordance with subparagraph (i) below. However, if the Participant was actively

employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1,

1975, the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 43 -

determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii), provided that subparagraph (ii)(B) shall not apply in

determining the amount of a Vested Pension.

(i)    Formula A: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be:

(A)    3 percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for the

first 10 years of Credited Service, plus

(B)    1 percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for

each year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less

(C)    1-2/3 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount

multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.

In determining the amount of a Vested Pension under this Formula A, the Pension shall first be

calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he

remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest

Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Separation from Service,

and then shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of

which is the Participant’s actual years of Credited Service on his Separation from Service and the

denominator of which is the years of Credited Service he would have

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 44 -

earned had he remained in the employ of an Employer until his Normal Retirement Age.

(ii)    Formula B: The Pension amount under this subparagraph shall be the greater

of (A) or (B) below:

(A)    1-1/2 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number

of years of Credited Service, less 50 percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security

Amount, or

(B)    3 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of

years of Credited Service up to 15 years, less 50 percent of the Participant’s Primary

Social Security Amount.

In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above, the Pension shall be

calculated on the basis of the Participant’s Credited Service (determined in accordance with

Section 3.3(c)(3) of Part B of the Salaried Plan), and his Highest Average Monthly Earnings and

Primary Social Security Amount at the date of disability.

(2)    Calculation: The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to

paragraph (1) above, subject to the following special rules:

(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic Partner’s Annuity:    Subject to

subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, the Participant’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 45 -

Domestic Partner shall be entitled to receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the

Participant’s Annuity under this section, with no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the

Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall

begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and shall

end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic

Partner’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is more than 10 years

younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable under this subparagraph shall be

adjusted as provided below.

(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor

benefit payable to such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by

0.8 percent.

(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or

Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to

such Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4

percent.

(ii)    Reductions: The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’s

PEP Guarantee.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 46 -

(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment

amount shall be reduced by 3/12ths of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit

commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal

Retirement Date.

(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a Vested Pension, the payment amount

shall be reduced to the actuarial equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal

Retirement Date (if payment commences before such date), and the Section 4.6(b)

reductions for any Pre Retirement Spouse’s coverage and Section 4.12(b) reductions for

any Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s coverage shall apply.

(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form

that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the

life of the surviving Eligible Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner, that is greater

than that provided under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’s Pension

under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the

Participant’s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the Pension otherwise payable under the

foregoing provisions of this section.

(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in a form

that provides a survivor annuity for a

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 47 -

beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner. In this instance,

the Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the

benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of a Single Life

Annuity for the Participant’s life.

(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his Pension in an

Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in Section 6.2(b). In this instance,

the Participant’s Pension under this section shall be reduced so that the total value of the

benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the actuarial equivalent of the elected

Annuity without such protection.

(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion: The amount of the Retirement Pension determined

under this section for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a

lump sum shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under

this section, taking into account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above

and any early retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.

For purposes of this paragraph (2), actuarial equivalence shall be determined taking into account the

PEP Guarantee’s purpose to preserve substantially the value of a benefit under the pre-1989 terms of

the Plan and the 409A Plan’s design that offers alternative annuities that are considered actuarial

equivalent

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 48 -

for purposes of Section 409A (taking into account, without limitation, the special rule for subsidized joint

and survivor annuities in Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(b)(ii)(C)).

5.3    Amount of Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension: The monthly amount of the Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s 409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under

subsection (a) below.

(a)    Calculation: An Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension shall be equal to:

(1)    The Eligible Spouse’s Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension, reduced by

(2)    The Eligible Spouse’s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension, and then

further reduced by (but not below zero)

(3)    The Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension derived from the Pre-409A

Program.

(b)    Basis for Determining: The Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension amount in subsection

(a) above shall be determined on a basis (i) that takes into account applicable reductions for early or late

commencement, and (ii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial Equivalent

as appropriate under the circumstances and pursuant to rules of the Plan Administrator, including to take

account the time and form of any prior payments.

(c)    Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 49 -

(1)    An Eligible Spouse’s “Total Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension” means the greater of:

(i)    The amount of the Eligible Spouse’s pre-retirement spouse’s pension

determined under the terms of Part B of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the

limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are

interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under

Section 5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan; or

(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Eligible Spouse’s PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement

Spouse’s Pension determined under subsection (c).

In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated as if

payable as of what would be the Normal Retirement Date of the Participant related to the Eligible

Spouse. The greater benefit determined under the prior sentence shall then be reduced/increased for

commencement before/after, as applicable, such Normal Retirement Date.

(2)    An “Eligible Spouse’s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension” means the

amount of the Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension determined under the terms of the

Salaried Plan.

(3)    An “Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension derived from the Pre-409A

Program” means the amount of the Eligible Spouse’s Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension determined

under the terms of the Pre-409A Program.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 50 -

(c)    PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension: An Eligible Spouse’s PEP Guarantee

Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below,

whichever is applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would have been available to the

Participant under

Section 5.2.

(1)    Normal Rule: The Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension payable under this paragraph

shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity, under a Qualified Joint and

Survivor Annuity, if the Participant had:

(i)    Separated from Service on the date of death (or, if earlier, his actual

Separation from Service);

(ii)    Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date

payments of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension are to commence; and

(iii)    Died on the day immediately following such commencement.

(2)    Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees: Notwithstanding paragraph (1)

above, the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described in

Section 4.6(a) shall not be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’s PEP

Guarantee determined under Section 5.2. For this purpose, Credited Service shall be determined as

provided in Section 3.3(c)(2) of Part B the Salaried Plan, and the deceased Participant’s Highest

Average Monthly Earnings, Primary Social Security Amount

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 51 -

and Covered Compensation shall be determined as of his date of death. A Pre-Retirement Spouse’s

Pension under this paragraph is not reduced for early commencement.

Principles similar to those applicable under – (i) Section 5.1(b), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 5.2(b)(2) shall

apply in determining the Pre-Retirement Spouse’s 409A Pension under this section.

5.4    Certain Adjustments: Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject

to adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan

or a nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored

by a member of the PepsiCo Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals.

(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants: This subsection shall apply to a current or former

Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is

recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service. In the event of any such recalculation, the

Participant’s PEP Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder to the maximum extent permissible under

Section 409A. For this purpose and to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A, the PEP

Guarantee under Section 5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner

as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any

specified plans.

(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans: If the benefit paid under a specified

plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether

the increase is by order of a

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 52 -

court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), then the PEP benefit for the

Participant shall be recalculated to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A. If the recalculation

identifies an overpayment hereunder, the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to

recover the overpayment. It is specifically intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this

Plan and any specified plans to the maximum extent permissible under Section 409A.

(c)    No Benefit Offsets That Would Violate Section 409A. Effective as of January 1, 2009, if a

Participant has earned a benefit under a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a

“qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the Salaried Plan and the

“Transfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.5 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, such Transfers and Non-

Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the Participant’s Total Pension under Section 5.1(c)(1) above

only to the extent the application of such rule to the Participant’s 409A Pension will not result in a change in

the time or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on

offsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with

respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying

plan and compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the

maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into

effect in a particular situation, the limit on offsets in the prior sentence will not apply.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 53 -

5.5    Excludable Employment: An executive who has signed a written agreement with the Company

pursuant to which the individual either (i) waives eligibility under the Plan (even if the individual otherwise meets the

definition of Employee under the Plan), or (ii) agrees not to participate in the Plan, shall not thereafter become entitled

to a benefit or to any increase in benefits in connection with such employment (whichever applies). Written

agreements may be entered into either before or after the executive becomes eligible for or begins participation in the

Plan, and such written agreement may take any form that is deemed effective by the Company. This Section 5.5 shall

apply with respect to agreements that are entered into on or after January 1, 2009.

5.6    Pre-409A Pension: A Participant’s Pre-409A Pension is the portion of the Participant’s Pension

that is grandfathered under Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-6(a)(3)(i) and (iv). Principles similar to those applicable

under – (i) Section 5.1(b), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 5.2(b)(2) shall apply in determining the Pre-409A

Pension under this section.

5.7    Offsets: Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company may reduce the amount of

any payment or benefit that is or would be payable to or on behalf of a Participant by the amount of any obligation of

the Participant to the Company that is or becomes due and payable, provided that (1) the obligation of the Participant

to the Company was incurred during the employment relationship, (2) the reduction during any Plan Year may not

exceed the amount allowed under Code Section 409A and (3) the reduction is made at the same time and in the

same amount as the obligation otherwise would have been due and collectable from the Participant. In addition, in

the event a Participant has earned a 409A Benefit (a “Prior 409A Benefit”) that was paid before, or will become

payable either before or under different payment terms than, an additional 409A Benefit for the Participant, the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 54 -

calculation of the Participant’s additional 409A Benefit shall include an offset for the Prior 409A Benefit. This offset

shall be determined as of the Annuity Starting Date of the additional 409A Benefit on a basis that (i) takes into

account applicable reductions for early or late commencement as of the Annuity Starting Date of the additional 409A

Pension, (ii) reflects, if applicable and customary, the relative value of forms of payment, and (iii) otherwise adjusts

the offset to its Actuarial Equivalent, in each such respect as appropriate and customary under the circumstances and

in accordance with rules authorized by the Plan Administrator. Therefore, by way of example, but not by way of

limitation, when pursuant to Section 4.5 a Participant is entitled to Post-Disability Accruals after having become

entitled to Pre-Separation Accruals, such an offset of the Pre-Separation Accruals will apply in determining the Post-

Disability Accruals.

5.8    Amount of Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension: The monthly amount of the Pre-

Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension payable to a surviving Eligible Domestic Partner under Section 4.12

shall be determined under subsection (a) below.

(a)    Calculation: An Eligible Domestic Partner’s Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A

Pension shall be equal to:

(1)    The Eligible Domestic Partner’s Total Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension,

reduced by

(2)     The Eligible Domestic Partner’s Salaried Plan Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s

Pension, and then further reduced by (but not below zero)

(3)    The Eligible Domestic Partner’s Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension derived

from the Pre-409A Program.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 55 -

(b)     Basis for Determining: The Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension amount in

subsection (a) above shall be determined on a basis (i) that takes into account applicable reductions for early

or late commencement, and (ii) otherwise adjusts the reductions in (a)(2) and (3) above to their Actuarial

Equivalent as appropriate under the circumstances and pursuant to rules of the Plan Administrator, including to

take account the time and form of any prior payments.

(c)    Definitions: The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:

(1)    An Eligible Domestic Partner’s “Total Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension”

means the greater of:

(i)    The amount of the Eligible Domestic Partner’s pre-retirement domestic

partner’s pension determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan, but without regard to: (A) the

limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are

interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan), and (B) the actuarial adjustment under Section

5.7(d) of Part B of the Salaried Plan, or

(ii)    The amount (if any) of the Eligible Domestic Partner’s PEP Guarantee Pre-

Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension determined under subsection (c).

In making this comparison, the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated as if

payable as of what would be the Normal Retirement Date of the Participant related to the Eligible

Domestic Partner. The greater benefit

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 56 -

determined under the prior sentence shall then be reduced/increased for commencement before/after,

as applicable, such Normal Retirement Date.

(2)    An “Eligible Domestic Partner’s Salaried Plan Pre- Retirement Domestic Partner’s

Pension” means the amount of the Eligible Domestic Partner’s Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s

Pension determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan.

(3)    An “Eligible Domestic Partner’s Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension derived

from the Pre-409A Program” means the amount of the Eligible Domestic Partner’s Pre-Retirement

Domestic Partner’s Pension determined under the terms of the Pre-409A Program

(c)    PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension: An Eligible Domestic Partner’s

PEP Guarantee Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension shall be determined in accordance with

paragraph (1) or (2) below, whichever is applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would

have been available to the Participant under Section 5.2.

(1)    Normal Rule:    The Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension payable

under this paragraph shall be equal to the amount that would be payable as a survivor annuity, under a

Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, if the Participant had:

(i)    Separated from Service on the date of death (or, if earlier, his actual

Separation from Service);

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 57 -

(ii)    Commenced a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the same date

payments of the Qualified Pre Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension are to commence; and

(iii)    Died on the day immediately following such commencement.

(2)    Special Rule for Active and Disabled Employees: Notwithstanding paragraph (1)

above, the Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension paid on behalf of a Participant described

in Section 4.6(a) shall not be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such Participant’s PEP

Guarantee determined under Section 5.2. For this purpose, Credited Service shall be determined as

provided in Section 3.3(c)(2) of the Salaried Plan, and the deceased Participant’s Highest Average

Monthly Earnings, Primary Social Security Amount and Covered Compensation shall be determined as

of his date of death. A Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension under this paragraph is not

reduced for early commencement.

Principles similar to those applicable under (i) Section 5.1(b), and (ii) the last sentence of Section 5.2(b)(2)

shall apply in determining the Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s 409A Pension under this section.

ARTICLE VI

Distribution of Benefits

The terms of this Article govern (i) the distribution of benefits to a Participant who becomes entitled to a

409A Pension, and (ii) the continuation of benefits (if any) to such Participant’s beneficiary following the Participant’s

death. A Pre-Retirement Spouse’s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s Pension derived from the 409A

Program shall be payable as an Annuity for the life of the Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, as applicable,

in all cases, subject to Section 4.9 (cashout distributions). The distribution of a Pre-409A Pension is governed by the

terms of the Pre-409A Program.

6.1    Form and Timing of Distributions: Benefits under the 409A Program shall be distributed as follows:

(a)    409A Retirement Pension: The following rules govern the distribution of a Participant’s

409A Retirement Pension:

(1)    Generally: A Participant’s 409A Retirement Pension shall be distributed as a Single

Lump Sum on the first day of the month that is coincident with or next follows the Participant’s

Retirement Date, subject to paragraph (2) and Section 6.6 (delay for Key Employees).

(2)    Prior Payment Election: Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a Participant who is entitled

to a 409A Retirement Pension and who made an election (i) up to and including December 31, 2007,

and (ii) at least six months prior to and in a calendar year prior to the Participant’s Annuity Starting

Date shall receive his benefit in accordance with such payment election. A payment election allowed a

Participant to choose either (i) to receive a distribution of his

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 59 -

benefit in an Annuity form, (ii) to commence distribution of his benefit at a time other than as provided

in paragraph 6.1(a)(1), or both (i) and (ii). A payment election made by a Participant who is only eligible

to receive a Vested Pension on his Separation from Service shall be disregarded. Subject to Section

4.9 (cashouts), a Participant who has validly elected to receive an Annuity shall receive his benefit as a

Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if he is married or as a Single Life Annuity if he is unmarried,

unless he elects one of the optional forms of payment described in Section 6.2 in accordance with the

election procedures in Section 6.3(a). A Participant shall be considered married if he is married on his

Annuity Starting Date (with such Annuity Starting Date determined taking into account any election

applicable under this subsection). To the extent a Participant’s benefit commences later than it would

under paragraph 6.1(a)(1) as a result of an election under this paragraph 6.1(a)(2), the Participant’s

benefit will be increased for earnings at the interest rate used to compute the Actuarial Equivalent lump

sum value through the date the check for payment is prepared, which interest shall be paid at the time

elected by the Participant under this paragraph 6.1(a)(2).

(b)    409A Vested Pension: Subject to Section 4.9, Section 6.6 and subsection (c) below, a

Participant’s 409A Vested Pension shall be distributed in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) below, unless,

in the case of a Participant who is married (as determined under the standards in paragraph 6.1(a)(2), above)

or has an Eligible Domestic Partner on his Annuity Starting Date, he elects one of the optional

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 60 -

forms of payment distributions in Section 6.2 in accordance with the election procedures in Section 6.3(a):

(1)    Separation Prior to Age 55: In the case of a Participant who Separates from Service

with at least five years of Service prior to attaining age 55, the Participant’s 409A Vested Pension shall

be distributed as an Annuity commencing on the first of the month that is coincident with or

immediately follows the date he attains age 55, which shall be the Annuity Starting Date of his 409A

Vested Pension. A distribution under this subsection shall be in the form of a Qualified Joint and

Survivor Annuity if the Participant is married or as a Single Life Annuity if he is not married; provided

that an unmarried Participant who has an Eligible Domestic Partner may elect a 50% Survivor Annuity

or 75% Survivor Annuity with his Eligible Domestic Partner as his beneficiary as provided in Section

6.2. A Participant shall be considered married or to have an Eligible Domestic Partner for purposes of

this paragraph if he is married or has an Eligible Domestic Partner on the Annuity Starting Date of his

409A Vested Pension.

(2)    Separation at Ages 55 Through 64: In the case of a Participant who Separates from

Service with at least five years but less than ten years of Service and on or after attaining age 55 but

prior to attaining age 65, the Participant’s 409A Vested Pension shall be distributed as an Annuity (as

provided in paragraph (1) above) commencing on the first of the month that follows his Separation from

Service.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 61 -

(c)    Disability Pension: The portion of a Participant’s 409A Disability Pension representing Pre-

Separation Accruals shall be paid on the first day of the month following the later of (i) the Participant’s

attainment of age 55 and (ii) the Participant’s Separation from Service. The available forms of payment for the

portion of a Participant’s 409A Disability Pension representing Pre-Separation Accruals (as defined in Section

4.5) shall be those forms available to a Participant who is entitled to a Vested Pension or a Retirement

Pension, as set forth in Section 6.2, below (including, to the extent applicable, the different forms available to a

married Participant / Participant with a domestic partner versus a single Participant). The portion of a

Participant’s 409A Disability Pension representing Post-LTD Accruals shall be paid on the first day of the

month following the Participant’s attainment of age 65 in a lump sum.

6.2    Available Forms of Payment: This section sets forth the payment options available to a Participant

who is entitled to a Retirement Pension under paragraph 6.1(a)(2) above or a Vested Pension under subsection

6.1(b) above.

(a)    Basic Forms: A Participant who is entitled to a Retirement Pension may choose one of the

following optional forms of payment by making a valid election in accordance with the election procedures in

Section 6.3(a). A Participant who is entitled to a Vested Pension and who is married on his Annuity Starting

Date may choose one of the optional forms of payment available under paragraph (1), (2)(ii) or (2)(iii) below

with his Eligible Spouse as his beneficiary (and no other optional form of payment available under this

subsection (a) shall be permitted to such a Participant). A Participant who is entitled to a Vested Pension, who

is not married and who has an Eligible Domestic Partner on his Annuity Starting Date may choose one of the

optional

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 62 -

forms available under paragraph (2)(ii) or (2)(iii) below with his Eligible Domestic Partner as his beneficiary

(and no other optional forms of payment available under this subsection shall be permitted to such a

Participant). A Participant who is entitled to a Vested Pension and who is not married and does not have an

Eligible Domestic Partner on his Annuity Starting Date shall receive a Single Life Annuity. Each optional

annuity is the actuarial equivalent of the Single Life Annuity:

(1)    Single Life Annuity Option: A Participant may receive his 409A Pension in the form

of a Single Life Annuity, which provides monthly payments ending with the last payment due prior to his

death.

(2)    Survivor Options: A Participant may receive his 409A Pension in accordance with

one of the following survivor options:

(i)    100 Percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced 409A

Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments

in the same reduced amount shall continue after the Participant’s death to his beneficiary for life,

beginning on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and

ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the beneficiary’s death.

(ii)    75 Percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced 409A

Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments

in the amount of 75 percent of such reduced 409A Pension shall be continued after the

Participant’s death to his beneficiary for life, beginning on the first day of

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 63 -

the month coincident with or following the Participant’s death and ending with the last monthly

payment due prior to the beneficiary’s death.

(iii)    50 Percent Survivor Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced 409A

Pension payable for life, ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death. Payments

in the amount of 50 percent of such reduced 409A Pension shall be continued after the

Participant’s death to his beneficiary for life, beginning on the first day of the month coincident

with or following the Participant’s death and ending with the last monthly payment due prior to the

beneficiary’s death. A 50 percent survivor option under this paragraph shall be a Qualified Joint

and Survivor Annuity if the Participant’s beneficiary is his Eligible Spouse.

(iv)    Ten Years Certain and Life Option: The Participant shall receive a reduced

409A Pension which shall be payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months. If

the retired Participant dies before 120 payments have been made, the monthly 409A Pension

amount shall be paid for the remainder of the 120 month period to the Participant’s primary

beneficiary (or if the primary beneficiary has predeceased the Participant, the Participant’s

contingent beneficiary).

(b)    Inflation Protection: The following levels of inflation protection may be provided to any

Participant who elects to receive all or a part of his 409A Retirement Pension as an Annuity:

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 64 -

(1)    5 Percent Inflation Protection: A Participant’s monthly benefit shall be initially

reduced, but thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 5 percent. The amount

of the increase shall be the difference between inflation in the prior year and 5 percent.

(2)    7 Percent Inflation Protection: A Participant’s monthly benefit shall be initially

reduced, but thereafter shall be increased if inflation in the prior year exceeds 7 percent. The amount

of the increase shall be the difference between inflation in the prior year and 7 percent.

Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1, beginning with the

second January 1 following the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date. The amount of inflation in the prior year

shall be determined based on inflation in the 12-month period ending on September 30 of such year, with

inflation measured in the same manner as applies on the Effective Date for adjusting Social Security benefits

for changes in the cost of living. Inflation protection that is in effect shall carry over to any survivor benefit

payable on behalf of a Participant, and shall increase the otherwise applicable survivor benefit as provided

above. Any election by a Participant to receive inflation protection shall be irrevocable by such Participant or

his surviving beneficiary.

6.3    Procedures for Elections: This section sets forth the procedures for making Annuity Starting Date

elections (i.e., elections under Section 6.2). Subsection (a) sets forth the procedures for making a valid election of an

optional form of payment under Section 6.2 and subsection (b) includes special rules for Participants with multiple

Annuity Starting Dates. An election under this Article VI shall be treated as received on a particular day if it is: (i)

postmarked that day, or (ii) actually received by the Plan Administrator on that day.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 65 -

Receipt under (ii) must occur by the close of business on the date in question, which time is to be determined by the

Plan Administrator. Spousal consent is not required for an election to be valid.

(a)    Election of an Optional Form of Payment: To be valid, an election of an optional form of

Annuity under Section 6.2, for (i) a Participant’s 409A Retirement Pension (if a proper election was made

under paragraph 6.1(a)(2)) or (ii) a Participant’s 409A Vested Terminated Pension, must be in writing, signed

by the Participant, and received by the Plan Administrator at least one day prior to the Annuity Starting Date

that applies to the Participant’s Pension in accordance with Section 6.1. In addition, an election under this

subsection must specify one of the optional forms of payment available under Section 6.2 and a beneficiary, if

applicable, in accordance with Section 6.5 below. To the extent permitted by the Plan Administrator, an election

made through electronic media shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for a written election, and an

electronic affirmation of such an election shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for a signed election.

(b)    Multiple Annuity Starting Dates: When amounts become payable to a Participant in

accordance with Article IV, they shall be payable as of the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date and the election

procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant’s unpaid accruals as of

such Annuity Starting Date, with the following exception. In the case of a Participant who is rehired after his

initial Annuity Starting Date and who (i) is currently receiving an Annuity that remained in pay status upon

rehire, or (ii) was previously paid a lump sum distribution (other than a cashout distribution described in

Section 4.9(a)), the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 66 -

Participant’s subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as a result of his subsequent Separation from Service), and

the election procedures at such subsequent Annuity Starting Date, shall apply only to the portion of his benefit

that accrues after his rehire. Any prior accruals that remain to be paid as of the Participant’s subsequent

Annuity Starting Date shall continue to be payable in accordance with the elections made at his initial Annuity

Starting Date.

(c)    Determination of Marital Status. Effective January 1, 2014, in any case in which the form of

payment of a Participant’s 409A Pension is determined by his marital status on his Annuity Starting Date, the

Plan Administrator shall assume the Participant is unmarried on his Annuity Starting Date unless the

Participant provides notice to the Plan prior to his Annuity Starting Date, which is deemed sufficient and

satisfactory by the Plan Administrator, that he is married. The Participant shall give such notification to the Plan

Administrator when he makes the election described in subsection (a) above or in accordance with such other

procedures that are established by the Plan Administrator for this purpose (if any). Notwithstanding the two

prior sentences, the Plan Administrator may adopt rules that provide for a different outcome than specified

above.

6.4    Special Rules for Survivor Options: The following special rules shall apply for the survivor options

available under Section 6.2.

(a)    Effect of Certain Deaths: If a Participant makes an election under Section 6.3(a) to receive

his 409A Retirement Pension in the form of an optional Annuity that includes a benefit for a surviving

beneficiary under Section 6.2 and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of the optional

form of payment in Section

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 67 -

6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies prior to the Annuity Starting Date of such Annuity, the election shall be disregarded. If the

Participant dies after this Annuity Starting Date but before his 409A Retirement Pension actually commences,

the election shall be given effect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse, Eligible Domestic

Partner or other beneficiary (as applicable) shall commence on the first day of the month following his death

(any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate). In the case of a Participant who has

elected the form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if such Participant: (i) dies after his Annuity

Starting Date, (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary, and (iii) before receiving 120 payments

under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the

Participant’s estate. If payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant’s primary or

contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed, then the remaining

payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to such beneficiary’s estate.

(b)    Beneficiary Who Is Not an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner: If a Participant’s

beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, he may not elect:

(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his beneficiary is

more than 10 years younger than he is, or

(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his beneficiary is

more than 19 years younger than he is.

6.5    Designation of Beneficiary: A Participant who has elected under Section 6.2 to receive all or part

of his Retirement Pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 68 -

option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death. Such designation shall

be made on the election form used to choose such optional form of payment or an approved election form filed under

the Salaried Plan, whichever is applicable. In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), the

Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary. A Participant (whether

active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to his Annuity

Starting Date. The designation of any beneficiary, and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance

with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator. A beneficiary designation shall not be effective unless and until filed

with the Plan Administrator. If no beneficiary is properly designated and a Participant’s elects a survivor’s option

described in Section 6.2(a)(2), the Participant’s beneficiary shall be his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner,

as applicable. A Participant entitled to a Vested Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary; if the

Participant is permitted under Section 6.2 to elect an optional form of payment, then his beneficiary shall be his

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, as applicable, on his Annuity Starting Date.

6.6    Required Delay for Key Employees: Notwithstanding Section 6.1 above, if a Participant is

classified as a Key Employee upon his Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Key Employee

status as may apply under Section 409A), then distributions to the Participant shall commence as follows:

(a)    Distribution of a Retirement Pension: In the case of a Key Employee Participant who is

entitled to a 409A Retirement Pension, distributions shall commence on the earliest first of the month that is at

least six months after the date the Participant Separates from Service (or, if earlier, the Participant’s death).

For periods

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 69 -

before 2009, commencement of distributions, however, shall not be delayed under the preceding sentence if

the Participant’s 409A Retirement Pension commences at the same time as his pension under the Salaried

Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).

(b)    Distribution of a Vested Pension. In the case of a Participant who is entitled to a 409A

Vested Pension, distributions shall commence as provided in Section 6.1(b), or if later, on the earliest first of

the month that is at least six months after the Participant’s Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the

Participant’s death). For periods before 2009, commencement of distributions, however, shall not be delayed

under the preceding sentence if the Participant’s 409A Vested Pension commences at the same time as his

pension under the Salaried Plan in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(3)(i).

(c)    Interest Paid for Delay. Any payments to the Participant that are delayed in accordance with

the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be increased for earnings at the interest rate used to compute the

Actuarial Equivalent lump sum value through the date the check for payment is prepared, with such delayed

payment and accumulated interest paid as a lump sum payment to the Participant on the date payment occurs

in accordance with subsection (a) or (b) above, whichever is applicable. If a Participant’s beneficiary or estate

is paid under subsection (a) or (b) above as a result of his death, then any payments that would have been

made to the Participant and that were delayed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall be

paid as otherwise provided in the Plan, with interest at the rate specified in the preceding sentence through the

date the check for payment is prepared.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 70 -

6.7    Payment of FICA and Related Income Taxes: As provided in subsections (a) through (c) below, a

portion of a Participant’s 409A Pension shall be paid as a single lump sum and remitted directly to the Internal

Revenue Service (“IRS”) in satisfaction of the Participant’s FICA Amount and the related withholding of income tax at

source on wages (imposed under Code Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable

state, local or foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA Amount) and the additional withholding of

income tax at source on wages that is attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes.

(a)    Timing of Payment: As of the date that the Participant’s FICA Amount and related income

tax withholding are due to be deposited with the IRS, a lump sum payment equal to the Participant’s FICA

Amount and any related income tax withholding shall be paid from the Participant’s 409A Pension and remitted

to the IRS (or other applicable tax authority) in satisfaction of such FICA Amount and income tax withholding

related to such FICA Amount. The classification of a Participant as a Key Employee (as defined in Section 2.1)

shall have no effect on the timing of the lump sum payment under this subsection (a).

(b)    Reduction of 409A Pension. To reflect the payment of a Participant’s FICA Amount and any

related income tax liability, the Participant’s 409A Pension shall be reduced, effective as of the date for

payment of the lump sum in accordance with subsection (a) above, with such reduction being the Actuarial

Equivalent of the lump sum payment used to satisfy the Participant’s FICA Amount and related income tax

withholding. It is expressly contemplated that this reduction may

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 71 -

occur effective as of a date that is after the date payment of a Participant’s 409A Pension commences.

(A)    No Effect on Commencement of 409A Pension. The Participant’s 409A Pension shall

commence in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The lump sum payment to satisfy the Participant’s

FICA Amount and related income tax withholding shall not affect the time of payment of the Participant’s

actuarially reduced 409A Pension, including not affecting any required delay in payment to a Participant

who is classified as a Key Employee.

ARTICLE VII

Administration

7.1    Authority to Administer Plan: The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator, which shall have

the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate. The Plan Administrator shall

maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations, and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant in

writing, including the Participant’s current mailing address, age and marital status. The Plan Administrator’s

interpretations, determinations, regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties

concerned. Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, and any restrictions that

might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan, including with respect to

the Company or the Plan Administrator.

7.2    Facility of Payment: Whenever, in the Plan Administrator’s opinion, a person entitled to receive

any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so

as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the

legal representative of such person for his benefit, or the Plan Administrator may apply the payment for the benefit of

such person in such manner as it considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit or installment thereof in accordance

with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under

the provisions of the Plan.

7.3    Claims Procedure: The Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan Administrator, shall

have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 73 -

the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits. As a result,

benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the Participant (or other

applicant) is entitled to them. Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and

unrestricted discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan

provisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question,

and even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. All

decisions and determinations made by the Plan Administrator will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The

Plan Administrator may consider the intent of the Company with respect to a Plan provision in making any

determination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that arguably do

not contemplate considering such intent. The Plan Administrator’s discretion is absolute, and in any case where the

breadth of the Plan Administrator’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Plan Administrator (or its

delegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Plan Administrator of its discretionary

authority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion). If,

pursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or

beneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan

Administrator, will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan

Administrator, a comprehensible written notice setting forth:

(a)    The specific reason or reasons for such denial;

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 74 -

(b)    Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;

(c)    A description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to submit

to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and

(d)    A description of the Plan’s claim review procedure (including the time limits applicable to

such process and a statement of the claimant’s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following a further

denial on review).

If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim

it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days. If this occurs, the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant

before the end of the initial 90-day period, indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date

by which the Plan Committee expects to make the final decision. The claim review procedure is available upon

written request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator, or the designated party, within 60 days after receipt by the

claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim. Upon review, the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a

full and fair review of the claim, including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments, document,

records and other information relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator’s review shall take into account such

comments, documents, records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial

determination. The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless

circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days. If this occurs, notice of the extension

will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period, indicating the special circumstances

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 75 -

requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision. The final

decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; include specific

reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based; and provide

that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request ad free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all

documents, records, and other information relevant to his or her claim for benefits.

Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court, arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed

solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination. In addition, any

such review shall be conditioned on the claimant’s having fully exhausted all rights under this section as is more fully

explained in Section 7.5. Any notice or other notification that is required to be sent to a claimant under this section

may be sent pursuant to any method approved under Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104b-1 or other

applicable guidance.

7.4    Effect of Specific References: Specific references in the Plan to the Plan Administrator’s discretion

shall create no inference that the Plan Administrator’s discretion in any other respect, or in connection with any other

provision, is less complete or broad.

7.5    Claimant Must Exhaust the Plan’s Claims Procedures Before Filing in Court: Before filing any

Claim (including a suit or other action) in court or in another tribunal, a Claimant must first fully exhaust all of the

Claimant’s rights under the claims procedures of Section 7.3.

(a)    Upon review by any court or other tribunal, the exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 is

intended to be interpreted to require exhaustion in as

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 76 -

many circumstances as possible (and any steps necessary to clarify or effect this intent may be taken).

(b)    In any action or consideration of a Claim in court or in another tribunal following exhaustion

of the Plan’s claims procedure as described in this Section 7.5, the subsequent action or consideration shall be

limited, to the maximum extent permissible, to the record that was before Plan Administrator in the claims

procedure.

(c)    The exhaustion requirement of this Section 7.5 shall apply: (i) regardless of whether other

Disputes that are not Claims (including those that a court might consider at the same time) are of greater

significance or relevance, (ii) to any rights the Plan Administrator may choose to provide in connection with

novel Disputes or in particular situations, (iii) regardless of whether the rights are actual or potential and (iv)

even if the Plan Administrator has not previously defined or established specific claims procedures that directly

apply to the submission and consideration of such Claim (in which case the Plan Administrator (upon notice of

the Claim) shall either promptly establish such claims procedures or shall apply (or act by analogy to) the

claims procedures of Section 7.3 that apply to claims for benefits).

(d)    The Plan Administrator may make special arrangements to consider a Claim on a class

basis or to address unusual conflicts concerns, and such minimum arrangements in these respects shall be

made as are necessary to maximize the extent to which exhaustion is required.

(e)     For example, exhaustion may not be excused (i) for failure to respond to a claim unless the

purported Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that

the purported Claimant was

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 77 -

submitting a claim with respect to the Plan, or (ii) for failure to fulfill a request for documents unless (A) the

Claimant is lawfully entitled to receive a copy of the requested document from the Plan Administrator at the

time and in the form requested, (B) the Claimant requests such documents in a writing that is addressed to

and actually received by the Plan Administrator, (C) the Plan Administrator fails to provide the requested

documents within 6 months after the date the request is received, or within such longer period as may be

reasonable under the facts and circumstances, (D) the Claimant took steps that were sufficient to make it

reasonably clear to the Plan Administrator that the requestor was actually entitled to receive the requested

documents at the time and in the form requested (i.e., generally the Claimant must provide sufficient

information to place the Plan Administrator on notice of a colorable claim for benefits), and (E) the documents

requested and not provided are material to the determination of one or more colorable claims of which the

Claimant has informed the Plan Administrator.

(f)    For purposes of this Section 7.5, the following definitions apply.

(i)    A “Dispute” is any claim, dispute, issue, action or other matter.

(ii)    A “Claim” is any Dispute that implicates in whole or in part any one or more of

the following –

(A)    The interpretation of the Plan

(B)    The interpretation of any term or condition of the Plan

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 78 -

(C)    The interpretation of the Plan (or any of its terms or conditions) in light

of applicable law;

(D)    Whether the Plan or any term or condition under the Plan has been

validly adopted or put into effect;

(E)    The administration of the Plan;

(F)    Whether the Plan, in whole or in part, has violated any terms,

conditions or requirements of ERISA or other applicable law or regulation, regardless of

whether such terms, conditions or requirements are, in whole or in part, incorporated into

the terms, conditions or requirements of the Plan;

(G)    A request for Plan benefits or an attempt to recover Plan benefits;

(H)    An assertion that any entity or individual has breached any fiduciary

duty; or

(I)    Any Claim that: (i) is deemed similar to any of the foregoing by the Plan

Administrator, or (ii) relates to the Plan in any way.

(iii)    A “Claimant” is any Employee, former Employee, Participant, former

Participant, beneficiary (or the spouse, former spouse, domestic partner, estate, heir or

representative of any of the foregoing individuals), or any other individual, person, entity with a

relationship to any of the foregoing individuals or the Plan, as well as any group of one or more of

the foregoing, who has a Claim.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 79 -

7.6    Limitations on Actions: Any claim filed under section 7.3 and any action filed in state or federal

court by or on behalf of a former or current Employee, Participant, beneficiary or any other individual, person or entity

(collectively, a “Petitioner”) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits or for the alleged interference with or

violation of ERISA-protected rights must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner’s cause of action first

accrues.

(a) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to a Petitioner’s benefits under

the Plan shall be deemed to accrue not later than the earliest of (i) when the Petitioner has received the

calculation of the benefits that are the subject of the claim or legal action, (ii) the date identified to the

Petitioner by the Plan Administrator on which payments shall commence, (iii) when the Petitioner has actual or

constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are the basis of his claim, or (iv)

the date when the benefit was first paid, provided, or denied.

(b) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to the alleged interference

with ERISA-protected rights shall be deemed to accrue when the claimant has actual or constructive

knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to constitute interference with

ERISA-protected rights.

(c) For purposes of this subsection, a cause of action with respect to any other claim, action or

suit not covered by subsection (a) or (b) above must be brought within two years of the date when the claimant

has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts or failures to act (or the other facts) that are alleged to give

rise to the claim, action or suit.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 80 -

Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner, or any

representative of the Petitioner, from filing the claim or cause of action. Correspondence or other communications

pursuant to or following the mandatory appeals process described in Section 7.3 shall have no effect on this two-year

time frame.

7.7    Restriction on Venue: Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the

Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner (as defined in Section 7.6 above) shall only be brought or filed in the United

States District Court for the Southern District of New York, effective for claims or actions filed on or after January 1,

2011.

ARTICLE VIII

Miscellaneous

8.1    Nonguarantee of Employment: Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of

employment between an Employer and any Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued in the

employment of an Employer, or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or

without cause.

8.2    Nonalienation of Benefits: Benefits payable under the Plan or the right to receive future benefits

under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,

encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to

anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any right to benefits

payable hereunder, including any assignment or alienation in connection with a divorce, separation, child support or

similar arrangement, shall be null and void and not binding on the Company. The Company shall not in any manner

be liable for, or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits

hereunder.

8.3    Unfunded Plan: The Company’s obligations under the Plan shall not be funded, but shall

constitute liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company’s general funds. To the extent the

Participant or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than

the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

8.4    Action by the Company: Any action by the Company under this Plan may be made by the Board of

Directors of the Company or by the Compensation Committee of the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 82 -

Board of Directors, with a report of any actions taken by it to the Board of Directors. In addition, such action may be

made by any other person or persons duly authorized by resolution of said Board to take such action.

8.5    Indemnification: Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine otherwise, the

Company shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any employee acting in good faith within the scope of his

employment in carrying out the administration of the Plan.

8.6    Compliance with Section 409A:

(a)    General: It is the intention of the Company that the Plan shall be construed in accordance

with the applicable requirements of Section 409A. Further, in the event that the Plan shall be deemed not to

comply with Section 409A, then neither the Company, the Board of Directors, the Plan Administrator nor its or

their designees or agents shall be liable to any Participant or other person for actions, decisions or

determinations made in good faith.

(b)    Non-duplication of benefits: In the interest of clarity, and to determine benefits in compliance

with the requirements of Section 409A, provisions have been included in this 409A Document describing the

calculation of benefits under certain specific circumstances, for example, provisions relating to the inclusion of

salary continuation during certain window severance programs in the calculation of Highest Average Monthly

Earnings, as specified in Appendix B. Notwithstanding this or any similar provision, no duplication of benefits

may at any time occur under the Plan. Therefore, to the extent that a specific provision of the Plan provides for

recognizing a benefit determining element (such as pensionable earnings or service) and this same

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 83 -

element is or could be recognized in some other way under the Plan, the specific provision of the Plan shall

govern and there shall be absolutely no duplicate recognition of such element under any other provision of the

Plan, or pursuant to the Plan’s integration with the Salaried Plan. This provision shall govern over any contrary

provision of the Plan that might be interpreted to support duplication of benefits.

8.7    Section 457A: To avoid the application of Code section 457A (“Section 457A”) to a Participant’s

Pension, the following shall apply to a Participant who transfers to a work location outside of the United States to

provide services to a member of the PepsiCo Organization that is neither a United States corporation nor a pass-

through entity that is wholly owned by a United States corporation (“Covered Transfer”):

(a)    The Participant shall automatically vest in his or her Pension as of the last business day

before the Covered Transfer;

(b)    From and after the Covered Transfer, any benefit accruals or other increases or

enhancements to the Participant’s Pension relating to –

(1)    Service, or

(2)    The attainment of a specified age while in the employment of the PepsiCo

Organization (“age attainment”),

(collectively, “Benefit Enhancement”) will not be credited to the Participant until the last day of the Plan Year in

which the Participant renders the Service or has the age attainment that results in such Benefit Enhancement,

and then only to the extent permissible under subsection (c) below at that time; and

(c)    The Participant shall have no legal right to (and the Participant shall not receive) any Benefit

Enhancement that relates to Service or age attainment

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 84 -

from and after the Covered Transfer to the extent such Benefit Enhancement would constitute compensation

that is includable in income under Section 457A.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsection (a) above shall not apply to a Participant who has a Covered Transfer if,

prior to the Covered Transfer, the Company provides a written communication (either to the Participant individually, to

a group of similar Participants, to Participants generally, or in any other way that causes the communication to apply

to the Participant – i.e., an “applicable communication”) that these subsections do not apply to the Covered Transfer

in question. Subsection (b) shall cease to apply as of the earlier of – (i) the date the Participant returns to service for a

member of the PepsiCo Organization that is a United States corporation or a pass-through entity that is wholly owned

by a United States corporation, or (ii) the effective date for such cessation that is stated in an applicable

communication.

8.8    Authorized Transfers: If a Participant transfers to an entity that is not part of the PepsiCo

Organization, the liability for any benefits accrued while the Participant was employed by the PepsiCo Organization

shall remain with the Company, except as otherwise expressly provided by an agreement between the Company and

the Participant’s new employer.

8.9     Electronic Signatures: The words “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to

this Plan or any other document or record to be signed in connection with or related to this Plan by the Company,

Plan Administrator, Employee or other individual shall be deemed to include electronic signatures and the keeping of

records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 85 -

executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the fullest extent

permissible under applicable law.

ARTICLE IX

Amendment and Termination

This Article governs the Company’s right to amend and or terminate the Plan. The Company’s

amendment and termination powers under this Article shall be subject, in all cases, to the restrictions on amendment

and termination in Section 409A and shall be exercised in accordance with such restrictions to ensure continued

compliance with Section 409A. The Company’s rights under this Article IX shall be as broad as permissible under

applicable law.

9.1    Continuation of the Plan: While the Company and the Employers intend to continue the Plan

indefinitely, they assume no contractual obligation as to its continuance. In accordance with Section 8.4, the

Company hereby reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any

time provided, however, that no such amendment or termination shall adversely affect the amount of benefit to which

a Participant or his beneficiary is entitled under Article IV on the date of such amendment or termination, unless the

Participant becomes entitled to an amount equal to such benefit under another plan or practice adopted by the

Company (except as necessary to comply with Section 409A). Specific forms of payment are not protected under the

preceding sentence.

9.2    Amendments: The Company may, in its sole discretion, make any amendment or amendments to

this Plan from time to time, with or without retroactive effect, including any amendment necessary to ensure

continued compliance with Section 409A. An Employer (other than the Company) shall not have the right to amend

the Plan.

9.3    Termination: The Company may terminate the Plan, (i) either as to its participation or as to the

participation of one or more Employers, (ii) with respect to a group of

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 87 -

Employees who experience a change in control in accordance with Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), or (iii)

as otherwise permitted under Code Section 409A. If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the

Employers, the Plan shall continue in effect for the benefit of the Employees of the remaining Employers. Upon

termination, the distribution of Participants’ 409A Pensions shall be subject to restrictions applicable under Section

409A.

9.4    Change in Control: The Company intends to have the maximum discretionary authority to

terminate the Plan and make distributions in connection with a Change in Control (defined as provided in Section

409A), and the maximum flexibility with respect to how and to what extent to carry this out following a Change in

Control as is permissible under Section 409A. The previous sentence contains the exclusive terms under which a

distribution shall be made in connection with any Change in Control in the case of benefits that are derived from this

409A Program.

ARTICLE X

ERISA Plan Structure

This Plan document in conjunction with the plan document(s) for the Pre-409A Program encompasses

three separate plans within the meaning of ERISA, as are set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c). This division into

separate plans became effective as of July 1, 1996; previously the plans set forth in subsections (b) and (c) were a

single plan within the meaning of ERISA.

(a)    Excess Benefit Plan: An excess benefit plan within the meaning of section 3(36) of ERISA,

maintained solely for the purpose of providing benefits for Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations

on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.

(b)    Excess Compensation Top Hat Plan: A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the

purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated

employees within the meaning of sections 201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. The plan provides benefits for

Salaried Plan participants in excess of the limitations imposed by section 401(a)(17) of the Code on benefits

under the Salaried Plan (after taking into account any benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan). For ERISA

reporting purposes, this portion of PEP may be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan I.

(c)    Preservation Top Hat Plan: A plan maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of

providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within

participants described in section 5.2(a) hereof, by preserving for them the pre-1989 level of benefit accrual that

was in effect before the Salaried Plan’s amendment effective January 1, 1989 (after taking into account any

benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan and Excess Compensation Top Hat Plan). For ERISA reporting

purposes, this portion of PEP shall be referred to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan II.

Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the Excess Benefit Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the

purpose indicated in (a) above; then any remaining benefits shall be allocated to the Excess Compensation Top Hat

Plan, to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose indicated in (b) above; then any remaining benefits shall be

allocated to the Preservation Top Hat Plan. These three plans are severable for any and all purposes as directed by

the Company.

In addition to the above, to the extent that lump sum termination benefits are paid under this Plan in

connection with a severed employee’s Special Early Retirement (as defined in Appendix Article D) under a temporary

severance program sponsored by the Company, this portion of the Plan shall be a component of the Company’s

unfunded severance plan that includes the temporary program of severance benefits in question. As a component of

a severance plan, the lump sum termination benefits are welfare benefits, and this portion is part of a “welfare benefit

plan” under ERISA section 3(1). This severance plan component shall exist solely (i) for the duration of the temporary

severance program in question, and (ii) for the purpose of paying severance benefits. As a portion of an ERISA

welfare plan, any such temporary severance benefits hereunder shall not be subject to the reporting requirements for

top hat plans under ERISA or any of the ERISA requirements for pension plans.

Transition Provisions

A.1    Scope.

This Article A provides the transition rules for the Plan that were effective at some time during the period

beginning January 1, 2005 and ending December 31, 2008 (the “Transition Period”). The time period during which

each provision in this Article A was effective is set forth below.

A.2    Transition Rules for Article II (Definitions).

(a)    Actuarial Equivalent. In addition to the provisions provided in Article II for determining actuarial

equivalence under the Plan, for the duration of the Transition Period, to determine the amount of a Pension

payable in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity, as an annuity

with inflation protection, or as a Single Life Annuity, the Plan Administrator used the actuarial factors under the

Salaried Plan.

(b)    Key Employee. In addition to the provisions provided in Article II for identifying Key Employees, the

following operating rules were in effect for the indicated time periods –

(1)    Operating Rules for 2005. To ensure that the Company did not fail to identify any Key

Employees, in the case of Separation from Service distributions during the 2005 Plan Year, the

Company treated as Key Employees all Participants (and former Participants) classified (or

grandfathered) for any portion of the 2005 Plan Year as Band IV and above.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 94 -

(2)    Operating Rules for 2006 and 2007. To ensure that the Company did not fail to identify any

Key Employees, in the case of Separation from Service distributions during the 2006 Plan Year and

2007 Plan Year, the Company treated as Key Employees for such applicable Plan Year of their

Separation from Service those individuals who met the provisions of (3) or (4) below (or both).

(3)    The Company shall treat as Key Employees all Participants (and former Participants) who

are classified (or grandfathered) as Band IV and above for any portion of the Plan Year prior to the Plan

Year of their Separation from Service; and

(4)    The Company shall treat as a Key Employee any Participant who would be a Key Employee

as of his or her Separation from Service date based on the standards in this paragraph (4). For

purposes of this paragraph (4), the Company shall determine Key Employees based on compensation

(as defined in Code Section 415(c)(3)) that is taken into account as follows:

(A)    If the determination is in connection with a Separation from Service in the first

calendar quarter of a Plan Year, the determination shall be made using compensation earned in

the calendar year that is two years prior to the current calendar year (e.g., for a determination

made in the first quarter of 2006, compensation earned in the 2004 calendar year shall be used);

and

(B)    If the determination is in connection with a Separation from Service in the second,

third or fourth calendar quarter of a Plan Year, the determination shall be made using the

compensation earned in

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 95 -

the prior calendar year (e.g., for a determination made in the second quarter of 2006,

compensation earned in the 2005 calendar year shall be used).

A.3    Transition Rules for Article VI (Distributions):

409A Pensions that would have been paid out during the Transition Period under the provisions set forth in the

main body of the Plan (but for the application of permissible transition rules under Section 409A) shall be paid out on

March 1, 2009.

A.4    Transition Rules for Article VII (Administration):

Effective during the Transition Period, the language of Section 8.6(a) shall be replaced in its entirety with the

following language:

“8.6(a)    Compliance with Section 409A:

At all times during each Plan Year, this Plan shall be operated (i) in accordance with the requirements of

Section 409A, and (ii) to preserve the status of deferrals under the Pre-409A Program as being exempt from

Section 409A, i.e., to preserve the grandfathered status of the Pre-409A Program. Any action that may be

taken (and, to the extent possible, any action actually taken) by the Plan Administrator or the Company shall

not be taken (or shall be void and without effect), if such action violates the requirements of Section 409A or if

such action would adversely affect the grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. If the failure to take an action

under the Plan would violate Section 409A, then to the extent it is possible thereby to avoid a violation of

Section 409A, the rights and effects under the Plan shall be altered to avoid such violation. A corresponding

rule shall apply with respect to a failure to take an action that would adversely affect the grandfather of the Pre-

409A Program. Any provision in this Plan

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 96 -

document that is determined to violate the requirements of Section 409A or to adversely affect the grandfather

of the Pre-409A Program shall be void and without effect. In addition, any provision that is required to appear

in this Plan document to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, but that is not expressly set forth, shall be

deemed to be set forth herein, and the Plan shall be administered in all respects as if such provision were

expressly set forth. A corresponding rule shall apply with respect to a provision that is required to preserve the

grandfather of the Pre-409A Program. In all cases, the provisions of this Section shall apply notwithstanding

any contrary provision of the Plan that is not contained in this Section.”

A.5    Transition Rules for Severance Benefits.

provided under a Severance Program and such additional Credited Service or earnings are included in the calculation

of the Participant’s Pension prior to the time that the Credited Service is actually performed by the Participant, or the

earnings are actually paid to the Participant, the Pension paid to the Participant shall be adjusted actuarially to reflect

the receipt of the portion of the Pension attributable to such Credited Service or earnings received on account of the

Severance Program prior to the time such Credited Service is performed or such earnings are actually paid to the

Participant. For purposes of determining the adjustment to be made, the Plan shall use the rate provided under the

Salaried Plan for early payment of benefits.

APPENDIX ARTICLE C

International and PIRP Transfer Participants

C.1    Scope:

This Article provides special rules for calculating the benefit of an individual who is either an “International

Transfer Participant” under Section C.2 below or a “PIRP Transfer Participant” under Section C.4 below. The benefit

of an International Transfer Participant shall be determined under Section C.3 below, subject to Section C.6 below.

The benefit of a PIRP Transfer Participant shall be determined under Section C.5 below. Once a benefit is determined

for an International Transfer Participant or a PIRP Transfer Participant under this Article, such benefit shall be subject

to the Plan’s normal conditions and shall be paid in accordance with the Plan’s normal terms. All benefits paid under

this Article are subject to Code section 409A, including any accrued prior to January 1, 2005. The provisions of this

Article relating to International Transfer Participants are effective April 1, 2007. The provisions of this Article relating

to PIRP Transfer Participants are effective January 1, 2016 (but they may take into account years that precede

January 1, 2016).

C.2    International Transfer Participants:

An “International Transfer Participant” is a Participant who is:

(a)    General Rule: An individual who, following a transfer to an April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary (as

defined in paragraph (5) of the Employer definition in Section 2.1 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, as in effect on

January 1, 2014)), would qualify as an Employee within the meaning of paragraph (2)(vi) of the Employee

definition in Section 2.1 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, as in effect on January 1, 2014 (U.S. citizen or resident

alien on qualifying temporary international assignment) but for the fact that his

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 112 -

assignment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary is in a position of employment that is classified as Band 4

(or its equivalent) or higher; or

(b)    Special Rule for Certain Permanent Assignments to Mexico: Notwithstanding subsection (a)

above, an International Transfer Participant also includes an individual who was transferred to an April 2007

Foreign Subsidiary based in Mexico, and who would qualify as an Employee within the meaning of paragraph

(2)(vi) of the Employee definition in Section 2.1 of Part B of the Salaried Plan, as in effect on January 1, 2014

(U.S. citizen or resident alien on qualifying temporary international assignment) but for the fact that:

(1)    His assignment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary is in a position that is classified as

Band 4 (or its equivalent) or higher;

(2)    Mexico is his home country on the records of the Expat Centre for Excellence group or its

successor (in accordance with such paragraph (2)(vi)); and

(3)    The duration of his assignment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary in Mexico is not

limited to 5 years or less.

An individual described in subsection (a) or (b) above may still qualify as an International Transfer Participant if

his transfer to an April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary occurred prior to April 1, 2007 (the effective date of this

Article), provided he satisfied the terms of subsection (a) or (b) above on the date of his transfer.

C.3    Benefit Formula for International Transfer Participants:

Except as provided in this Section C.3, an International Transfer Participant’s benefit under the Plan shall be

determined using a calculation methodology that is substantially similar to that which applies under Section 5.1 of the

Plan.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 113 -

(a)    Total Pension for International Transfer Participant: Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an

International Transfer Participant’s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be

calculated as if he continued to receive Credited Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan while working

for the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary to which he transferred following his employment with an Employer

based in the United States, without regard to the actual date on which he ceased receiving Credited Service

and Earnings under the Salaried Plan. However, the Total Pension of an International Transfer Participant

whose transfer to an April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary occurred prior to 1992 shall not take into account Credited

Service and Earnings for employment with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary prior to 1992.

(b)    Calculation of International Transfer Participant’s Benefit: The International Transfer Participant’s

benefit under the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his Total Pension as determined under subsection (a)

above (expressed as a lump sum as of his benefit commencement date under the Plan) by the following

amounts:

(1)    The amount of his actual benefit under the Salaried Plan (expressed as a lump sum amount

on his benefit commencement date), and

(2)    Any amounts paid to him from a “qualifying plan” as that term is defined under Section

3.5(c)(4) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (Transfers and Non-Duplication) with respect to his assignment

with the April 2007 Foreign Subsidiary (with such amounts expressed as a lump sum on his benefit

commencement date under this Plan).

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 116 -

(i)    “Year of Transfer” is the year in which a transfer described in subsection (f) above occurs.

C.5    Benefit Formula for PIRP Transfer Participants:

Except as provided in this Section C.5, a PIRP Transfer Participant’s benefit under the Plan shall be

determined using a calculation methodology that is substantially similar to that which applies under Section 5.1 of the

Plan.

(a)    Total Pension for PIRP Transfer Participant: Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a PIRP

Transfer Participant’s “Total Pension” (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(1) of the Plan) shall be calculated as

provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) below.

(1)    First, a PIRP Transfer Participant’s Total Pension shall be calculated as if he were an

eligible employee under the Salaried Plan for the entire Year of Transfer, and as if he received Credited

Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Year of Transfer equal to – (i) his actual Credited

Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Year of Transfer, increased by (ii) any other

compensation and service for the Year of Transfer that would have been recognized as PIRP-DB Salary

and PIRP DB Pensionable Service, if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not apply for the Year of Transfer.

(2)    If (during a year a PIRP Transfer Participant is otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan)

the PIRP Transfer Participant would be credited with PIRP-DB Salary that cannot be recognized under

PIRP as a result of Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB, and if this PIRP-DB Salary would be considered for

accrual purposes under PIRP-DB in connection with PIRP-DB Pensionable Service that is not

recognized under this Plan, the increase in the PIRP Transfer Participant’s

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 117 -

Accrued Benefit under PIRP that is related to this PIRP-DB Pensionable Service and that is blocked by

Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB shall be added to the PIRP Transfer Participant’s Accrued Benefit under this

Plan. In the case of a PIRP Transfer Participant who has a Separation from Service on or after January

1, 2017, this increase in the PIRP Transfers Participant’s Accrued Benefit under this Plan shall result in

an appropriate increase, determined in the Company’s discretion, in the Total Pension determined

under paragraph (1) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining Credited Service and

Earnings under this subsection (a), no compensation or service shall be taken into account more than

once, and a PIRP Transfer Participant’s Total Pension shall be determined in a way that avoids any

duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP Transfer Participant under PIRP-

DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the

Company or an affiliate, but without applying any offset that would violate Code Section 409A.

(b)    Calculation of PIRP Transfer Participant’s Benefit: The PIRP Transfer Participant’s benefit under

the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his Total Pension as determined under subsection (a) above by the

reductions that are normally applicable under Article V. In addition, in the case of a PIRP Transfer Participant

who has a Separation from Service on or after January 1, 2017, if (during a year a PIRP Transfer Participant is

otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan) the value of the PIRP Transfer Participant’s benefit under PIRP-

DB would increase (if Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB did not apply) as a result of the PIRP Transfer Participant

becoming eligible for early retirement

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 118 -

under PIRP-DB, then the projected increase in value of the PIRP-DB benefit at the PIRP Transfer Participant’s

retirement under PIRP-DB, which will be blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP, shall result in an appropriate

increase, determined in the Company’s discretion, in the Participant’s benefit under this Plan that is payable at

the time and in the form applicable under this Plan. The appropriate increase shall be determined net of any

expected increase in the value of the benefit under this Plan related to becoming eligible for Early Retirement

under this Plan. In addition, a PIRP Transfer Participant’s appropriate increase shall be determined in a way

that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP Transfer Participant

under PIRP-DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the

Company or an affiliate, but without applying any offset that would violate Code Section 409A.

C.6    Alternative Arrangements Permitted:

Notwithstanding any provision of this Article or the Plan to the contrary, the Company and a Participant who

would qualify as an International Transfer Participant under Section C.2 above may agree in writing to disregard the

provisions of this Article in favor of another mutually agreed upon benefit arrangement under the Plan that complies

with Code Section 409A, in which case this Article shall not apply.

APPENDIX ARTICLE D

Band 4 or Higher Rehired Yum Participants

D.1    Scope:

Effective May 1, 2009, this Article provides special rules for calculating the benefit of a transferred Participant

whose transfer would be an Eligible Transfer under Section TRI.2(e) of the Part B of the Salaried Plan but for the fact

that such individual is reemployed by the Company on or after May 1, 2009, into a position that is classified as Band

4 (or its equivalent) or higher. For purposes of determining such Participant’s Total Pension within the meaning of

Section 5.1(c)(1), but not for purposes of determining such Participant’s Salaried Plan Pension within the meaning of

Section 5.1(c)(2), such Participant’s position on reemployment will be deemed to be classified as below Band 4 (or its

equivalent), so that the Participant’s transfer is eligible to be treated as an Eligible Transfer (subject to the other

conditions thereof) and the Participant is eligible for the imputed service provisions of Section TRI.4(b) and (c). Such

Participant’s benefit otherwise shall be subject to the Plan’s usual conditions and shall be paid in accordance with the

Plan’s usual terms. All benefits paid under this Article are subject to Code section 409A.

APPENDIX ARTICLE E -

Time and Form of Payment for Benefits Paid During Severance Windows

E.1    Scope.

This Article E sets forth the time and form of payment provisions that apply to benefits under the Plan that are

paid to a Covered Participant (as defined in Section E.2 below). This Article is effective for Participants who are

terminated in a Severance Program or under circumstances that qualify them for an Individual Severance Agreement

(each as defined in Section E.2 below) on or after January 1, 2009 (or in the case of Participants covered by

Appendix Article PBG, on or after January 1, 2012). Nothing in this Article E shall make any of the additional benefits

that are made available under the Plan in any Severance Program or pursuant to any Individual Severance

Agreement a permanent feature of the Plan.

E.2    Definitions:

Where the following words and phrases appear in this Appendix E with initial capitals, they shall have the

meaning set forth below unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context. Any terms used in this Article E

of the Appendix with initial capitals and not defined herein shall have the same meaning as in the main Plan, unless a

different meaning is plainly required by the context.

(a)    “Applicable Summary Plan Description” means the summary plan description that sets forth the

terms and conditions of a particular Severance Program.

(b)    “Covered Participant” means a Participant whose employment with the Company is terminated

and who is eligible for Special Early Retirement either (i) under a Severance Program and pursuant to the

terms of the Applicable Summary Plan Description, or (ii) pursuant to the terms of an Individual Severance

Agreement.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 121 -

(c)    “Individual Severance Agreement” means an agreement between the Company and a Covered

Participant that – (i) sets forth the terms and conditions of the Covered Participant’s termination of employment

and (ii) expressly provides that the termination qualifies the Covered Participant for Special Early Retirement

under PEP.

(d)    “Kicker” means the Special Early Retirement benefit that is provided to a Covered Participant

pursuant to the terms of an Applicable Summary Plan Description or an Individual Severance Agreement and

that is equal to the following: (i) the Participant’s benefit under the Salaried Plan and this Plan as of his

Termination Date, determined based on the benefit formulas and early retirement reduction factors for Early

Retirement Pensions under each plan, minus (ii) the Participant’s Vested Pension under the Salaried Plan and

this Plan as of the Termination Date, determined based on the benefit formulas and reduction factors for

Vested Pensions under each plan. The Kicker shall be divided into the following components:

(1)    The “PEP Kicker,” which is the portion of the Kicker paid under the Plan as a replacement

for benefits that the Participant could have earned under the Plan but for his Separation from Service

(either in a Severance Program or pursuant to the terms of an Individual Severance Agreement) prior to

attaining Normal or Early Retirement under the Plan; and

(2)    The “Qualified Kicker,” which is the portion of the Kicker paid under the Plan as a

replacement for benefits that the Participant could have earned under the Salaried Plan but for his

termination of employment (either in a Severance Program or pursuant to the terms of an Individual

Severance

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 122 -

Agreement) prior to attaining Normal or Early Retirement under the Salaried Plan.

In determining the early retirement reduction factors for ages before 55, the monthly rate of reduction

applicable between age 56 and age 55 shall apply unless (i) in the case of a Participant who is eligible for

Special Early Retirement under a Severance Program, a different factor is used in the Salaried Plan for

employees covered by the same Severance Program in which case such other factor shall be used, and (ii) in

the case of a Participant who is eligible for Special Early Retirement pursuant to the terms of an Individual

Severance Agreement, a different factor is called for therein, in which case such other factor shall be used.

(e)    “Severance Program” has the same meaning that applies to that term under Appendix Section

ERW.2(f) of Part B of the Salaried Plan (legacy PepsiCo Appendix).

(f)    “Special Early Retirement” means a retirement from the Company that either – (i) satisfies all of the

conditions for receiving special early retirement benefits that are set forth in an Applicable Summary Plan

Description, or (ii) is expressly recognized as qualifying for special early retirement benefits pursuant to the

terms of an Individual Severance Agreement.

(g)    “Termination Date” means the later of – (i) the Covered Participant’s Separation from Service, or

(ii) date as of which the Covered Participant’s severance leave of absence (if any) is projected to terminate

under the terms of the Applicable Summary Plan Description or the Individual Severance Agreement, as

applicable. If clause (ii) of the preceding sentence applies, then a Participant’s Termination Date shall

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 123 -

be determined as of the date of the Participant’s Separation from Service using the formulas for calculating the

severance leave of absence, as such formulas are in effect under the Applicable Summary Plan Description or

the Individual Severance Agreement when the legally binding right to special early retirement benefits arises in

connection with the Severance Program or pursuant to the Individual Severance Agreement. A Participant’s

Termination Date, once set in accordance with the prior two sentences, shall not change based on any

circumstances or events that follow the date of the Participant’s Separation from Service.

E.3    Time and Form of Payment for 409A Pension:

A Covered Participant’s 409A Pension (calculated without regard to the Kicker for purposes of this Section

E.3) shall be paid as follows:

(a)    Non-Retirement Eligible Participants: If a Covered Participant is not eligible for Retirement as of

his Separation from Service, the Participant’s 409A Pension shall be paid as a Vested Pension under Section

6.1(b) according to the form of payment provisions applicable to Vested Pensions under Section 6.2.

(b)    Retirement Eligible Participants:

(1)    If the Covered Participant is eligible for a Normal, Early or Late Retirement Pension under

Article IV as of his Separation from Service, the Participant’s 409A Pension shall be paid as a

Retirement Pension under Section 6.1(a)(1); provided, however, that if the Participant made a valid prior

payment election under Section 6.1(a)(2), his 409A Pension shall be paid as a Retirement Pension in

accordance with such election.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 124 -

(2)    If the Covered Participant becomes eligible for a Normal or Early Retirement Pension after

his Separation from Service, including during the period between his Separation from Service and the

last day of his paid leave of absence (if any), the Participant’s 409A Pension shall be paid as a Vested

Pension under Section 6.1(b) according to the form of payment provisions applicable to Vested

Pensions under Section 6.2.

(c)    Special Early Retirement Eligible Participants: If a Covered Participant is eligible for Special Early

Retirement as of his Separation from Service or becomes so eligible during the period between his Separation

from Service and the last day of his paid leave of absence (if any), the Participant’s 409A Pension shall be

paid as a Vested Pension under Section 6.1(b) according to the form of payment provisions applicable to

Vested Pensions under Section 6.2.

E.4    Time and Form of Payment of Kicker Benefits:

A Covered Participant’s PEP Kicker and Qualified Kicker shall be paid as follows:

(a)    PEP Kicker: A Participant’s PEP Kicker shall be paid as a single lump sum on the first day of the

month following the later of (i) the Participant’s 55  birthday, or (ii) the Participant’s Separation from Service;

provided, however, that if the Participant made a valid Prior Payment Election under Section 6.1(a)(2), the

Participant’s PEP Kicker shall be paid according to such election (even in cases where the Participant’s 409A

Pension is paid according to Section E.3(b)(2) above). In the event the Participant dies after meeting the

requirements for a PEP Kicker but before it is paid, the PEP Kicker shall be paid to his Surviving Spouse or

surviving Eligible Domestic Partner in a single lump

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 125 -

sum 60 days following his death, and if there is no Surviving Spouse or surviving Eligible Domestic Partner,

then to the Participant’s estate.

(b)    Qualified Kicker: A Participant’s Qualified Kicker shall be paid based on his Separation from

Service as a single lump sum on the first day of the month coincident or next following his Termination Date;

provided, however, that if the Applicable Summary Plan Description or Individual Severance Agreement that

creates the Participant’s legally binding right to the Qualified Kicker expressly provides for a different time

and/or form of payment, the provisions of this subsection (b) shall not apply, and the Participant’s Qualified

Kicker shall be paid as provided in the Applicable Summary Plan Description or Individual Severance

Agreement, as applicable. In the event the Participant dies after meeting the requirements for a Qualified

Kicker but before it is paid, the Qualified Kicker shall be paid to his Surviving Spouse or surviving Eligible

Domestic Partner in a single lump sum 60 days following his death, and if there is no Surviving Spouse or

surviving Eligible Domestic Partner, then to the Participant’s estate.

E.5    Delay for Key Employees:

Notwithstanding any provision of this Appendix E to the contrary, if a Participant is determined to be a Key

Employee, any payment under this Article E that is made on account of his Separation from Service shall be subject

to the required delay in payment for Key Employees under Section 6.6, except to the extent that the payment

qualifies for an exemption from the application of Section 409A.

APPENDIX ARTICLE F -

U.K. Supplementary Appendix Participants with U.S. Service

F.1    Scope:

This Article applies to “Covered U.K. Employees” as defined in Section F.2 below. The benefit of a Covered

U.K. Employee shall be determined as provided in Section F.3 below. Once a benefit is determined for a Covered

U.K. Employee under this Article, it shall be paid in accordance with the Plan’s normal terms regarding the time and

form of payment. All benefits payable under this Article are subject to Code section 409A. This Article has been

restated effective January 1, 2016 (the original version of this Article was effective January 1, 2011, and it applied, in

accordance with its prior terms, to periods of service before January 1, 2016).

F.2    “Covered U.K. Employee” Defined:

A “Covered U.K. Employee” is a participant in the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (“U.K. Participant”) who – (i)

becomes subject to United States income taxes, e.g., by transferring to a position with the Company in the United

States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as “Engages in U.S. Service”), (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the

PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service, (iii) would have also accrued a benefit under the U.K.

Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the

unavailability of accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service), (iv)

subsequently either – (A) is localized in the United States as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization, or (B)

terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the U.K. Participant

commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States, as defined in the

Code), and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses, is then designated by

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 127 -

the Company (in its completely unfettered discretion) as a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally

binding right to a benefit under this Article F at the time of the designation. The period that a U.K. Participant Engages

in U.S. Service shall begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his “U.S.

Commencement Date”), and it shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or, if earlier, the

date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence (his “U.S. Cessation Date”).

F.3    Benefit for Covered U.K. Employees:

A Covered U.K. Employee’s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating, as of his Modified U.S.

Cessation Date, his “Total U.K. Supplementary Benefit” and then subtracting from this amount his “Frozen U.K.

Supplementary Benefit.” For this purpose, a Covered U.K. Employee’s—

(a)    “Modified U.S. Cessation Date” is the earliest of the following – (i) the date he is no longer subject

to U.S. income taxes, (ii) the date he first satisfies clause (iv) of Section F.2, (iii) the date he commences an

assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States (as defined in the Code),

or (iv) the date his Plan benefits under this Article F commence.

(b)    “Total U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he would have under the terms

of the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix, calculated based on all service and compensation with the

Company through his Modified U.S. Cessation Date that is counted in the calculation of his benefit under the

PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan (or that would be counted but for a limitation applicable to the plan under U.K.

law), and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his

benefits under this Article F commence, and

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 128 -

(c)    “Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit” is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the

U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date, and with such

total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this

Article F commence.

The calculation provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the operating rules set forth

in Section F.4 below.

F.4    Operating Rules:

The following operating rules apply to the calculation in Section F.3. above.

(a)    In general, accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.

Employee’s U.S. Cessation Date shall not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section

F.3. Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F.3 to the contrary, to the extent a Covered

U.K. Employee’s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K.

Employee’s U.S. Cessation Date have more than fully offset the Covered U.K. Employee’s accruals under the

U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix (and the excess would have been offset against the benefit under this

Article F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix), then any such excess as of the

date benefits under this Article F commence (expressed as a lump sum as of such date) shall be offset against

the benefits under this Article F to the extent such offset would not violate Code Section 409A.

(b)    In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F, the actuarial assumptions that are

used shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 129 -

417(e) of the Code and, specifically, are the Code Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the

Salaried Plan to pay a retirement lump sum as of the date applicable that the lump sum in question is to be

determined under this Article F.

(c)    A Covered U.K. Employee’s Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit shall be determined on the basis

of assuming that the Covered U.K. employee voluntarily terminated employment and any other service

relationship with the PepsiCo Organization as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date.

(d)    This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary

Pension Appendix are amended during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F.3

calculation, and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the immediately following year. In this case, to

the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A, the calculation in Section F.3 shall be

made by delaying the application of the amendment so that it is prospectively effective starting with the

immediately following year.

(e)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F, (ii) has reached

his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a

Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service, the foregoing terms shall be applied again to

determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service, except that any resulting

benefit from this new period shall be reduced by the lump sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F

(as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of benefits).

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

(f)    In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F, (ii) has reached

his U.S. Cessation Date, and (iii) then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would

be eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than this Article F (the “Other Provisions”), then

the Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for the new

period of service, except that any resulting benefit from this new period of service shall be reduced by the lump

sum value of any prior benefit under this Article F (as necessary to completely avoid any duplication of

benefits).

F.5    No Other Benefits:

A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while

he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F.2.

were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee). In addition, prior to the time that an individual has

satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee, the individual has no legally binding right

to a benefit under this Article F. Accordingly, for the avoidance of doubt, at any point before such time, the Company

may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F (e.g., by deciding

that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee, in an unfettered exercise of the Company’s

discretion), regardless of the services performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time,

and regardless of any other factor.

G.1    Scope:

This Article provides an opportunity for certain Participants, who Separated from Service before January 1,

2018 and who are eligible to receive a 409A Vested Pension, to make a one-time election to delay the distribution of

their 409A Vested Pension as permitted by Code section 409A(a)(4)(C). This opportunity is referred to in this

Scheduled Payment Date”).

G.4    No Change in Form

A Participant is not permitted to use a Delay Election to change the form of payment of his or her distribution,

except that:

(a)    The Participant’s marital status as of the New Scheduled Payment Date shall determine the form

of annuity payable under the Delay Election (with such marital status determined as of the New Scheduled

Payment Date in accordance with Section 6.3(c) (“Determination of Marital Status”)), and

(b)    Any reduction for early commencement (as applicable under Section 5.1(b) (“Basis for

Definitions of Eligible Domestic Partner Applicable Prior to January 1, 2019

APPENDIX ARTICLE H –

H.1    Scope.

This Article H provides the definition of Eligible Domestic Partner for periods prior to January 1, 2019.

H.2    Definition of Eligible Domestic Partner.

Paragraphs a, b, c and d are effective for the dates indicated in the paragraph. Paragraph e sets forth general

rules. Paragraph f sets forth defined terms.

a) January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 Provisions For applicable dates from January 1, 2016

through December 31, 2018, “Eligible Domestic Partner” status is not recognized under the Plan, in light of

the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision that the Constitution guarantees the right to same-sex marriage.

1. Limited Exception for 2016 Plan Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and solely for applicable dates in

2016, in the case of a Participant who (i) has a relationship with an individual on December 31, 2015

that is recognized as an eligible domestic partner or civil union relationship under paragraph (2) below

and (ii) on any date during the 2015 Plan Year, is either an Employee who is actively employed or on an

Authorized Leave of Absence from the PepsiCo Organization or a Participant, Eligible Domestic Partner

means the individual with whom the Participant has entered into such an arrangement that was valid on

the applicable date.

b) June 26, 2013 through December 31, 2015 Provisions.

1. Civil Unions. If on the applicable date the Participant resides in a state that does not permit

same-sex marriage and the Participant has entered

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 134 -

into a same-sex civil union that is valid on the applicable date in the state in which it was entered

into, the Participant’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with whom the

Participant has entered into such a same-sex civil union. If a Participant resides in a state that

does not permit same-sex marriage but does permit same-sex civil unions, the Participant is not

eligible to have an Eligible Domestic Partner unless the Participant is in a valid same-sex civil

union.

2. State of Residence Allows Neither Civil Unions Nor Marriage. If the Participant does not have an

Eligible Domestic Partner (and is not eligible to have one) pursuant to subsection (a) above, the

Participant’s Eligible Domestic Partner (if any) is the individual with whom the Participant has

executed a legally binding same-sex domestic partner agreement that meets the requirements

set forth in writing by the Company with respect to eligibility for domestic partner benefits that is

in effect on the applicable date. If such Participant has not entered into such an agreement, the

Participant is not eligible to have an Eligible Domestic Partner.

c) January 1, 2013 through June 25, 2013 Provisions. For applicable dates from January 1, 2013 through

June 25, 2013, Eligible Domestic Partner means an individual described in paragraph (3) above, and also

includes the following: If on the applicable date the Participant has entered into a same-sex marriage that

is valid on the applicable date in the state in which it was entered into, the Participant’s Eligible Domestic

Partner (if any) is the Participant’s spouse pursuant to

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 135 -

such same-sex marriage. If the Participant resides in a state that permits same-sex marriage, the

Participant is not eligible to have an Eligible Domestic Partner unless either (a) the Participant is in a valid

same-sex marriage or (b) such state did not start to permit same-sex marriages until less than 12 months

before the applicable date.

d) Pre-2013 Provisions. For applicable dates before January 1, 2013, “Eligible Domestic Partner” status was

not available in the Plan.

e) Additional Rules. This paragraph (5) applies to the definition of Eligible Domestic Partner for the applicable

dates covered by this H notwithstanding any provisions in paragraphs (1), (2),(3) or (4) to the contrary. The

term “Eligible Domestic Partner" does not apply to an individual who is of the opposite sex of the

Participant. A Participant who lives in a state that permits same-sex marriage is not permitted to have an

Eligible Domestic Partner. In the case of applicable dates prior to January 1, 2016, if the Participant’s state

started to permit same-sex marriage or same-sex civil unions less than 12 months before the applicable

date, the Participant is treated as residing in a state that does not permit same-sex marriage or same-sex

civil unions, as the case may be, for purposes of this definition of Eligible Domestic Partner.

f) Defined Terms. For purposes of the definition of “Eligible Domestic Partner” in this Article H, the following

definitions apply: “applicable date” means the earlier of the Participant’s Annuity Starting Date and date of

death, and “state” means any domestic or foreign jurisdiction having the legal authority to sanction

marriages or civil unions.

APPENDIX ARTICLE I –

409A PEP Makeup for Certain Pre-409A Benefits

    I.1    Scope:

To ensure there will be no “material modification” of the Pre-409A Program, this Article provides a

makeup benefit under the 409A Program that applies to certain participants in the Pre-409A Program (“Pre-

409A Participants”) in lieu of updating the Pre-409A Program’s actuarial factors for early commencement of

Vested Pensions to be consistent with the “2019 Salaried Program Factors” (as that term is defined in the

definition of Actuarial Equivalent). In the case of participants in the Pre-409A Program who are also

Participants in the 409A Program (without regard to this Article), this makeup relating to the early

commencement reduction of Vested Pensions payable as annuities is provided under the main text of the

Plan. However, this makeup is provided under this Article in the case of affected Pre-409A Participants who

are otherwise not entitled to a benefit under the 409A Program.

I.2    Eligibility Under This Article:

To be eligible under this Article, an individual must be a Pre-409A Participant:

(a)    Who is paid a Pre-409A Pension that is (i) a “Vested Pension” under the Pre-409A Program, and

(ii) paid in the form of an annuity commencing as of a date prior to the Pre-409A Participant’s Normal

Retirement Date but as of on or after January 1, 2019;

(b)     Whose Pre-409A Pension annuity under subsection (a) above is reduced for early

commencement under the terms of the Pre-409A Program by more

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 137 -

than it would be if the early commencement reduction were calculated using the 2019 Salaried Plan

Factors; and

(c)    Who otherwise would not have a 409A Pension that is payable effective as of January 1, 2019 or

later because, except as provided in this Article, the only PEP Pension to which the individual is entitled

is a Pre-409A Pension, or because his otherwise applicable 409A Pension commenced payment as of

prior to January 1, 2019.

An individual who satisfies all of the foregoing eligibility requirements shall be referred to as an “Eligible

Person” for purposes of this Article.

I.3    Benefit Amount Under This Article:

The benefit amount for an Eligible Person under this Article shall be the single lump sum that is the

Actuarial Equivalent of the difference between:

(a)    The Single Life Annuity that would be payable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A Program

as of the Eligible Person’s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program if the 2019 Salaried

Program Factors for early commencement applied in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with

respect to any portion of the Participant’s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee),

and

(b)    The Single Life Annuity that is actually applicable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A

Program as of the Eligible Person’s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program, because of the

early commencement factors that

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 138 -

are actually applicable in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with respect to any portion of

the Participant’s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee).

Such Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be calculated as of the applicable commencement date specified in

Section I.4 below; however, if the applicable commencement date is the Section I.4(b) date (i.e. December 1,

2019) and the Eligible Person’s actual Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program precedes December

1, 2019, then the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be determined as of such actual Annuity Starting Date

and then brought forward with Actuarial Equivalent interest to December 1, 2019. For purposes of subsection

(a) above, the 2019 Salaried Program Factors shall be solely the new factors applicable under the Salaried

Program as of January 1, 2019 (and no alternative calculation using the factors in effect before January 1,

2019 shall apply).

I.4    Time of Payment Under This Article:

The lump sum benefit calculated under this Appendix shall be payable as of the Eligible Person’s

applicable commencement date, which is the latest of the following:

(a)     The first of the month following the Eligible Person’s Separation from Service,

(b)     December 1, 2019, or

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 139 -

(c)     The first of the month following the Eligible Person’s attainment of age 55 (except that this

subsection (c) shall not apply to the extent that the Eligible Person’s benefit is derived from Article PBG

of this Appendix).

In the event that the Eligible Person’s applicable commencement date is the date in subsection (a) above, then

the date of actual payment of the benefit shall be delayed to the extent provided by Section 6.6(a) of the main

text of the Plan, and in the case of such a delay, the benefit determined as of such applicable commencement

date shall be increased by interest for the period of delay as provided in Section 6.6(c) of the main text of the

Plan.

I.5    Non-Duplication of Benefits:

The foregoing Sections of this Article are intended to provide a make-up benefit under the 409A Program for applying

an early commencement reduction under the Pre-409A Program using factors that predate the 2019 Salaried Plan

Factors, with respect to a Pre-409A Pension that is paid in the form of an annuity and that has an Annuity Starting

Date of January 1, 2019 or later. However, no duplication of benefits may occur at any time under the Plan.

Therefore, to the extent an Eligible Person has received or will receive a 409A Pension that, without regard to this

Article, effectively provides some or all of such makeup (e.g., because the Eligible Person’s 409A Pension was

reduced for early commencement using Early Retirement reduction factors), or to the extent that the Plan

Administrator concludes that providing the makeup under this Article would otherwise result in a duplication of

benefits, the makeup benefit under this Article shall be reduced (but not below zero) as the Plan Administrator deems

appropriate to eliminate all

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 140 -

duplication of benefits. This provision shall govern over any contrary provision of this Article or the Plan that might be

interpreted to support a duplication of benefits.

(1)    Is ineligible to participate in PERP,

(2)    Would be barred from earning a benefit under PIRP-DB by Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB (based

on the employee’s status as a U.S. Person),

based on the existence of special circumstances regarding his ability to receive retirement benefits, and

(4)    Is subsequently determined by the Vice President to be entitled to status as a Covered

determination in paragraph (4) shall be made in conjunction with a Selected International Employee’s

Retirement (but not before the year of a Selected International Employee’s distribution date under Section J.4).

Prior to the time of the determination in paragraph (4) above, a Selected International Employee shall not have

a legally binding right (within the meaning of Code Sections 409A and 457A) to a Pension or any distribution

under this Article J.

- 143 -

J.3    Benefit for Covered International Employees:

A Covered International Employee’s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating the Pension to

which he would be entitled under the main part of the Plan (which shall include treating the Covered International

Employee as a Plan Participant and reflecting the differences in the calculation of a Participant’s Pension that is a

Vested Pension versus a Retirement Pension), but giving effect to the following modifications.

(a)    References in the main part of the Plan to any benefit determining factors that are determined in

accordance with the provisions of the Salaried Plan shall be applied as if the Covered International Employee

were eligible for the Salaried Plan at all times during his employment by a Designated PepsiCo Affiliate or a

member of the PepsiCo Organization (except as modified by giving effect to any applicable modifications in the

following subsections).

(b)    The reductions to the Covered International Employee’s Total Pension that ordinarily apply under

Section 5.1(a)(2) and (3) (i.e., the offsets for the Salaried Pension Plan and Pre-409A Pension Plan) shall not

apply, unless a “Reduction Amount” is indicated in the “Benefit Information Table” below for the Covered

International Employee, and in that case the amount of reduction that is applied shall equal the Reduction

Amount.

(c)    The PEP Guarantee formula of Section 5.2 shall not apply with respect to a Covered International

Employee.

(d)    If a “Service Start Date” is indicated in the Benefit Information Table below, such Service Start

Date shall be used to determine the Covered International Employee’s Pension rather than the Covered

International Employee’s actual service

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 144 -

commencement date. Accordingly, in such a case, any service by the Covered International Employee before

the indicated Service Start Date shall be disregarded in calculating the Covered International Employee’s

Pension under this Appendix J.

(e)    If an “Earnings Start Date” is indicated in the Benefit Information Table below, such Earnings Start

Date shall be used to determine the Covered International Employee’s Pension rather than the Covered

International Employee’s actual earnings commencement date. Accordingly, in such a case, any earnings by

the Covered International Employee before the indicated Earnings Start Date shall be disregarded in

calculating the Covered International Employee’s Pension under this Appendix J.

(f)    If a “Minimum Lump Sum” is indicated in the Benefit Information Table below, the Covered

International Employee’s Pension, when converted to a Single Lump Sum, shall not be less than the indicated

Minimum Lump Sum.

The following operating rules apply to the calculation of a Covered International Employee’s Pension under

this Appendix J.

(a)    In determining the value of a Single Lump Sum under this Article J, the actuarial assumptions that

are used shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section 417(e) of the Code and, specifically, are the

Code Section 417(e) assumptions that would be used under the Salaried Plan to pay a retirement lump sum

as of the date when the Single Lump Sum in question is to be determined under this Article J.

(b)    A Covered International Employee’s Pension is subject in all respects to the freeze of the Salaried

Plan that is effective December 31, 2025, and accruals of (and rights and benefits with respect to) a Covered

International Employee’s Pension under this Appendix J shall be frozen fully and in all respects to the same

extent that Salaried Plan accruals, rights and benefits are frozen as of that date.

J.6    No Other Benefits:

APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG

Effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 2011, the PBG PEP is hereby merged with and into the PepsiCo

PEP, with the PepsiCo PEP as the surviving plan after the merger. The following Appendix Article PBG governs PBG

PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the merger, except as follows: (i) Articles VII

(Administration), VIII (Miscellaneous), IX (Amendment and Termination), X (ERISA Plan Structure) and XI (Applicable

Law) of the main section of this document shall govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP

Document, and (ii) effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2019, if a Participant elects a survivor,

period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity (or an annuity with other optional features), the adjustment of the

Single Life Annuity to Actuarial Equivalent optional annuity shall be determined under the provisions of the main

section of this document. There shall be no change to the time or form of payment of benefits that are subject to

Code section 409A under either the PepsiCo PEP or PBG PEP Document as a result of the plan merger or the

revisions made to the 409A PBG PEP Document when it was incorporated into this Appendix.

ARTICLE I TO APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - HISTORY AND PURPOSE

1.1    History of Plan. The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP”

or “Plan”) effective April 6, 1999 for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the

PBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The Plan was initially established as a successor plan to

the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’s April 6, 1999 initial public offering, and the Plan included

historical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan

provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 147 -

Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, the Plan

provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009,

the Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under the Salaried Plan is reduced due to the

employees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program and for certain executives who

would be “Grandfathered Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP

(or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Effective Time). The Plan is intended as a nonqualified unfunded

deferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the Employee Retirement Income

Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the Plan that provides benefits

based on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is intended to be an “excess

benefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended to be a plan described

in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of management or highly-

compensated employees.

The Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement

effective as of April 1, 2009 (“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG

with and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the

“Company”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the Company

and Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Company, Inc., and to facilitate the Company’s assumption of PBG’s role as the Plan’s

sponsor.

1.2    Effect of Amendment and Restatement. The Plan as in effect on October 3, 2004 is referred to herein as the

Prior Plan.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 148 -

Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Section 6.1(b)(3) of this Plan, a Participant’s benefit (including death

benefits), determined under the terms of the Plan as in effect on October 3, 2004 as if the Participant had terminated

employment on December 31, 2004, without regard to any compensation paid or services rendered after 2004, or any

other events affecting the amount of or the entitlement to benefits (other than the Participant’s survival or the

Participant’s election under the terms of the Plan with respect to the time or form of benefit) (the “Grandfathered

Benefit”) shall be paid at the time and in the form provided by the terms of the Plan as in effect on October 3, 2004.

The benefit of a Participant accrued under this Plan based on all compensation and services taken into account by

the Prior Plan and this Plan, less the Participant’s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be paid in the times and in the form as

provided in this Plan. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this Plan, this Plan superseded the Prior Plan

effective January 1, 2009, with respect to amounts accrued and vested after 2004 by Participants who had not

commenced receiving benefits as of January 1, 2009. The Plan was administered in accordance with a good faith

interpretation of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder from

January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008. Amounts accrued under this Plan after 2004 shall be treated as

payable under a separate Plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

based upon the following assumptions:

(i)    That the Participant’s social security wages in any year prior to Retirement or

severance are equal to the Taxable Wage Base in such year, and

(ii)    That he will not receive any social security wages after Retirement or severance.

However, in computing a Vested Pension under Section 4.2, the estimate of the old-age

greater than $130,000 (as adjusted under Section 416(i)(1) of the Code);

(ii)    A 5-percent owner of any member of the PBG Organization; or

(iii)    A 1-percent owner of any member of the PBG Organization having annual

compensation of more than $150,000.

compensation shall be treated as officers. For purposes of this section, annual compensation means

compensation as defined in Treas. Reg. § 1.415(c)-2(a), without regard to Treasury Reg. §§

1.415(c)-2(d), 1.415(c)-2(e), and 1.415(c)-2(g). The Plan Administrator shall determine who is a

Specified Employee in accordance with Section 416(i) of the Code and the applicable regulations and

other guidance of general applicability issued thereunder or in connection therewith, and provided

further that the applicable year shall be determined in accordance with Section 409A and that any

modification of the foregoing definition that applies under Section 409A shall be taken into account.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

(2)    Applicable Year. Except as otherwise required by Section 409A, the Plan Administrator shall

determine Specified Employees as of the last day of each calendar year, based on compensation for

such year, and such designation shall be effective for purposes of this Plan for the twelve month period

commencing on April 1  of the next following calendar year.

st

(3)    Rule of Administrative Convenience. In addition to the foregoing, the Plan Administrator

shall treat all other Employees classified as E5 and above on the applicable determination date

prescribed in subsection (2) (i.e., the last day of each calendar year) as a Specified Employee for

purposes of the Plan for the twelve-month period commencing of the applicable April 1  date. However,

st

if there are at least 200 Specified Employees without regard to this provision, then it shall not apply. If

there are less than 200 Specified Employees without regard to this provision, but full application of this

provision would cause there to be more than 200 Specified Employees, then (to the extent necessary to

avoid exceeding 200 Specified Employees) those Employees classified as E5 and above who have the

lowest base salaries on such applicable determination date shall not be Specified Employees.

(4)    Identification of Specified Employees Between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the period between February 26, 2010 and March 31, 2010,

Specified Employees shall be identified by combining the lists of Specified Employees of all Employers

as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. The foregoing method of identifying Specified

Employees is intended to comply with Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(i)(6)(i),

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 155 -

which authorizes the use of an alternative method of identifying Specified Employees that complies with

Treas. Reg. §§ 1.409A-1(i)(5) and -1(i)(8) and Section VII.C.4.d of the Preamble to the Final

Regulations under Section 409A of the Code, which permits “service recipients to simply combine the

pre-transaction separate lists of specified employees where it is determined that such treatment would

be administratively less burdensome.”

(5)     Identification of Specified Employees on and After April 1, 2010. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, for the periods on after April 1, 2010, Key Employees shall be identified as follows:

(i)     For the period that begins on April 1, 2010, and ends on March 31, 2011, an

employee shall be a Specified Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii) below) if he was classified

as at least a Band IV or its equivalent on December 31, 2009. For this purpose, an employee

shall be considered to be at least a Band IV or its equivalent as of a date if the employee is

classified as one of the following types of employees in the PepsiCo Organization on that date: (i)

a Band IV employee or above in a PepsiCo Business, (ii) a Level E7 employee or above in a

PBG Business, or (iii) a Salary Grade 19 employee or above at a PAS Business.

                (ii)    For the twelve-month period that begins on April 1, 2011, and for each twelve-month period that

begins on April 1 in subsequent years, an employee shall be a Specified Employee (subject to subparagraph (iii)

below) if the employee was an employee of the PepsiCo Organization who was classified as Band IV or above on the

December 31 that immediately precedes such April 1.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 156 -

                (iii)    Notwithstanding the rule of administrative convenience in paragraph (3) above, an employee shall be

a Specified Employee for the 12-month period that begins on any April 1, if as of the preceding December 31 the

employee would be a specified employee, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i), or any successor,

by applying as of such December 31 the default rules that apply under such regulation for determining the minimum

number of a service recipient’s specified employees. If the preceding sentence and the methods for identifying

Specified Employees set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, taken together, would result in more than 200

individuals being counted as Specified Employees as of any December 31 determination date, then the number of

individuals treated as Specified Employees pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii), who are not described in the first

sentence of this subparagraph (iii), shall be reduced to 200 by eliminating from consideration those employees

otherwise added by such subparagraph in order of their base compensation, from the lowest base compensation to

the highest.

                (iv)    For purposes of this paragraph (5), “PAS Business” means each employer, division of an employer or

other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PAS business; “PBG

Business” means each employer, division of an employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the

Company classifies as part of the PBG business; and “PepsiCo Business” means each employer, division of an

employer or other organizational subdivision of an employer that the Company classifies as part of the PepsiCo

business.

The method for identifying Specified Employees set forth in this definition is intended as an alternative method

of identifying Specified Employees under Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(i)(5),

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 157 -

and is adopted herein and shall be interpreted and applied consistently with the rules applicable to such alternative

arrangements.

(bb)    Vested Pension. The PEP Pension available to a Participant who has a vested PEP Pension

and is not eligible for a Retirement Pension.

2.2    Construction. The terms of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with this section.

(a)    Gender and Number. The masculine gender, where appearing in the Plan, shall be deemed to

include the feminine gender, and the singular may include the plural, unless the context clearly indicates to the

contrary.

(b)    Compounds of the Word “Here”. The words “hereof”, “hereunder” and other similar compounds

of the word “here” shall mean and refer to the entire Plan, not to any particular provision or section.

ARTICLE III TO APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - PARTICIPATION

3.1    Each Salaried Plan Participant whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is curtailed by the Compensation

Limitation or the Section 415 Limitation, or both, and each other Salaried Plan Participant (i) who is a Grandfathered

Employee as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan and who made elective deferrals to the EID on or after April

1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011 (inclusively); (ii) who would have been considered a Grandfathered Participant

as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan during the period April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010 if the

Participant had not been classified by the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP on March 31, 2009; or (iii) whose

1988 pensionable “earnings” under the Salaried Plan, as described in Section 4.2(a), were $75,000 or more, shall

participate in this Plan.

ARTICLE IV TO APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - AMOUNT OF RETIREMENT PENSION

4.1    PEP Pension. Subject to Sections 4.5 and 8.7, a Participant’s PEP Pension shall equal the amount

determined under (a) or (b) of this Section 4.1, whichever is applicable. Such amount shall be determined as of the

date of the Participant’s Separation from Service.

(a)    Same Form as Salaried Plan. If a Participant’s PEP Pension will be paid in the same form and

will commence as of the same time as his pension under the Salaried Plan, then his monthly PEP Pension

shall be equal to the excess of:

(1)    The greater of:

(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant

under the Salaried Plan without regard to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415

Limitation; (III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant

under the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011; and (IV) the April 1, 2009

through December 31, 2010 exclusion from the Salaried Plan definition of a Grandfathered

Participant of a Participant who, as of March 31, 2009, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or

MP and had attained age 50 and completed five years of Service or whose sum of his age and

years of Service was at least 65; and

(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in

such form and payable as of such time; over

(2)    The amount of the monthly pension benefit that is in fact payable to such Salaried Plan

Participant under the Salaried Plan, expressed in such form and payable as of such time.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 159 -

The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the

Participant’s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.

(b)    Different Form than Salaried Plan. If a Participant’s PEP Pension will be paid in a different form

(whether in whole or in part) or will commence as of a different time than his pension benefit under the

Salaried Plan, his PEP Pension shall be the product of:

(1)    The greater of:

(i)    the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such Participant

under the Salaried Plan without regard to (I) the Compensation Limitation; (II) the Section 415

Limitation; (III) the exclusion from Earnings of amounts deferred at the election of the Participant

under the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011; and (IV) the March 31, 2009

through December 31, 2010 exclusion from the Salaried Plan definition of a Grandfathered

Participant of a Participant who, as of such date, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and

had attained age 50 and completed five years of Service or whose sum of his age and years of

Service was at least 65; and

(ii)    if applicable, the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.2, expressed in

the form and payable as of such time as applies to his PEP Pension under this Plan, multiplied

by

(2)    A fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)

(1), reduced by the value of his pension under the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 160 -

Salaried Plan, and the denominator of which is the value of the amount determined in Section 4.1(b)(1)

(with value determined on a reasonable and consistent basis, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator,

with respect to similarly situated employees).

The amount of the monthly pension benefit so determined, less the portion of such benefit that is the

Participant’s Grandfathered Benefit, shall be payable as provided in Section 6.2.

Notwithstanding the above, in the event any portion of the accrued benefit of a Participant under this

Plan or the Salaried Plan is awarded to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, as

such terms are defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, the Participant’s total PEP Pension shall be adjusted, as

the Plan Administrator shall determine, so that the combined benefit payable to the Participant and the

alternate payee from this Plan and the Salaried Plan is the amount determined pursuant to subsections 4.1(a)

and (b) above, as applicable.

4.2    PEP Guarantee. Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be

entitled to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below, if any.

(a)    Eligibility. A Participant shall be covered by this section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable

earnings from an Employer of at least $75,000. For purposes of this section, “1988 pensionable earnings”

means the Participant’s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year that was recognized for benefit accrual

received under the Salaried Plan as in effect in 1988. “1988 pensionable earnings” does not include

remuneration from an entity attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 161 -

(b)    PEP Guarantee Formula. The amount of a Participant’s PEP Guarantee shall be determined

under paragraph (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).

(1)    Formula. The amount of a Participant’s PEP Guarantee under this paragraph shall be

determined as follows:

(i)    Three percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for the first 10

years of Credited Service, plus

(ii)    One percent of the Participant’s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for each year of

Credited Service in excess of 10 years, less

(iii)    One and two-thirds percent of the Participant’s Primary Social Security Amount

multiplied by years of Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.

In determining the amount of a Vested Pension, the PEP Guarantee shall first be calculated on

the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Participant would have earned had he continued to accrue

Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest Average Monthly Earnings and

Primary Social Security Amount at the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the date such

Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan, and then

shall be reduced by multiplying the resulting amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the

Participant’s actual years of Credited Service on the earlier of his Severance from Service Date or the

date such Participant ceased to accrue additional benefits under both the Salaried Plan and this Plan

and the denominator of which is the years of Credited Service

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 162 -

he would have earned had he continued to accrue Credited Service until his Normal Retirement Age.

(2)    Calculation. The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph

(1) above, subject to the following special rules:

(i)    Surviving Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic Partner’s Annuity: Subject to

subparagraph (iii) below and the last sentence of this subparagraph, if the Participant has an

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner and has commenced receipt of an Annuity under

this section, the Participant’s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be entitled to

receive a survivor annuity equal to 50 percent of the Participant’s Annuity under this section, with

no corresponding reduction in such Annuity for the Participant. Annuity payments to a surviving

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall begin on the first day of the month coincident

with or following the Participant’s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to

the Eligible Spouse’s or Eligible Domestic Partner’s death. If the Eligible Spouse or Eligible

Domestic Partner is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit

payable under this subparagraph shall be adjusted as provided below.

(A)    For each full year more than 10 but less than 21 that the surviving Eligible

Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit

payable to such

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 163 -

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.

(B)    For each full year more than 20 that the surviving Eligible Spouse or Eligible

Domestic Partner is younger than the Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such

Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner shall be reduced by an additional 0.4

percent.

This subparagraph applies only to a Participant who retires on or after his Early

Retirement Date.

(ii)    Reductions. The following reductions shall apply in determining a Participant’s PEP

Guarantee.

(A)    If the Participant will receive an Early Retirement Pension, the payment

amount shall be reduced by 3/12  of 1 percent for each month by which the benefit

ths

commencement date precedes the date the Participant would attain his Normal

Retirement Date.

(B)    If the Participant is entitled to a Vested Pension, the payment amount shall be

reduced to the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount payable at his Normal Retirement Date

(if payment commences before such date), and the reductions set forth in the Salaried

Plan for any Pre-Retirement Spouse’s coverage or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner’s

coverage shall apply.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 164 -

(C)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form

that provides an Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner benefit, continuing for the

life of the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, that is greater than that provided

under subparagraph (i). In this instance, the Participant’s PEP Guarantee under this

section shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s

behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of the PEP Guarantee otherwise payable under the

foregoing provisions of this section.

(D)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form

that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible

Domestic Partner. In this instance, the Participant’s PEP Guarantee under this section

shall be reduced so that the total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is

the Actuarial Equivalent of a Single Life Annuity for the Participant’s life.

(E)    This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an

Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in the Salaried Plan. In this

instance, the Participant’s PEP Guarantee under this section shall be reduced so that the

total value of the benefit payable on the Participant’s behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent of

the elected Annuity without such protection.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 165 -

(iii)    Lump Sum Conversion. The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section

for a Participant whose Retirement Pension will be distributed in the form of a lump sum shall be the

Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s PEP Guarantee determined under this section, taking into

account the value of any survivor benefit under subparagraph (i) above and any early retirement

reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.

(iv)    April 1, 2009 Salaried Plan Changes.

(A)    The amount of the PEP Guarantee determined under this section for a Participant

who, as of March 31, 2009, was classified as salary band E3-E8 or MP and who had attained

age 50 and completed five years of Service or (inclusively) whose sum of his age and years of

Service was at least 65 shall be determined as if such Participant were a Grandfathered

Participant in the Salaried Plan on April 1, 2009 (so that Earnings and Credited Service were not

frozen as of March 31, 2009 for the period April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010).

(B)    Highest Average Monthly Earnings shall be determined without regard to the

exclusion from Earnings under the Salaried Plan of amounts deferred at the election of the

Participant under the EID on or after April 1, 2009 and before January 1, 2011.

4.3    Certain Adjustments. Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to

adjustment as provided in this section. For purposes of this section, “specified plan” shall mean the Salaried Plan or a

nonqualified pension plan similar to this Plan. A nonqualified pension plan is similar to this Plan if it is sponsored by a

member of the PBG

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 166 -

Organization and if its benefits are not based on participant pay deferrals (this category of similar plans includes the

PepsiCo Prior Plan).

(a)    Adjustments for Rehired Participants. This subsection shall apply to a current or former

Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is

recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service, or (ii) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan

would have been recalculated, based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would have

been considered a Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant

was not classified by the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP. In such event, the Participant’s PEP Pension

shall be recalculated hereunder. For this purpose, the PEP Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in-

service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried

Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any specified plans.

(b)    Adjustment for Increased Pension Under Other Plans. If the benefit paid under a specified plan

on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the

increase is by order of a court, by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan, or otherwise), the

PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated. If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder,

the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it deems advisable to recover the overpayment. It is specifically

intended that there shall be no duplication of payments under this Plan and any specified plans.

(c)    No Benefit Offsets That Would Violate Section 409A. If a Participant has earned a benefit under

a plan maintained by a member of the PepsiCo/PBG

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 167 -

Organization that is a “qualifying plan” for purposes of the “Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.8 of Part A of the

Salaried Plan and the “Transfers and Non-Duplication” rule in Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan, such

Transfers and Non-Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the amount determined under Section 4.1(a)

(1) or 4.1(b)(1) above (as applicable) only to the extent the application of such rule will not result in a change in

the time or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A. For purposes of the limit on

offsets in the preceding sentence, it is the Company’s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with

respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying

plan, and compliant with Section 409A, in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the

maximum extent possible; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into

effect in a particular situation, the limit on offsets in the prior sentence will not apply.

4.4    Reemployment of Certain Participants. In the case of a current or former Participant who is

reemployed and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date, payment of his non-

Grandfathered PEP Pension will not be suspended. If such Participant accrues an additional PEP Pension for service

after such reemployment, his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the

present value of PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant, as determined by the Plan Administrator.

4.5    Vesting; Misconduct. Subject to Section 8.7, a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at

the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, or

any other provision of the Plan to the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 168 -

contrary, a Participant shall forfeit his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan Administrator determines that such

Participant has engaged in “Misconduct” as defined below, determined without regard to whether the Misconduct

occurred before or after the Participant’s Severance from Service. The Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion,

require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the Participant within the twelve month period

immediately preceding a date on which the Participant has engaged in such Misconduct, as determined by the Plan

Administrator.

“Misconduct” means any of the following, as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith: (i) violation of

any agreement between the Company or Employer and the Participant, including but not limited to a violation relating

to the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets, the solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers,

licensors or contractors, or the performance of competitive services, (ii) violation of any duty to the Company or

Employer, including but not limited to violation of the Company’s Code of Conduct; (iii) making, or causing or

appropriately protected by the privilege.

ARTICLE V TO APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - DEATH BENEFITS

5.1    Death Benefits. Each Participant entitled to a PEP Pension under this Plan who dies before his Annuity

payable under the Salaried Plan instead of this Plan. The death benefit with respect to a Participant’s PEP Pension in

excess of the Grandfathered Benefit shall become payable on the Participant’s date of death in a Single Lump Sum

payment.

Payment of any death benefit of a Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date under the Plan shall

be made to the persons and in the proportions to which any death benefit under the Salaried Plan is or would be paid

Salaried Plan, if any, with respect to deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2013).

ARTICLE VI TO APPENDIX ARTICLE PBG - DISTRIBUTIONS

below); and (ii) whose Annuity Starting Date has not occurred as of January 1, 2009, shall receive his

PEP Pension in excess of his Grandfathered Benefit in a Single Lump Sum which shall become payable

on January 1, 2009.

(2)    Annuity Election. A Participant who (i) attained age 50 on or before January 1, 2009, (ii) on

or before December 31, 2008 irrevocably elected to receive a Single Life Annuity, a 50%, 75% or 100%

initial employment date, shall receive his PEP Pension in excess of his Grandfathered Benefit in the

form elected commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his Separation

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 171 -

prior to July 1, 2009 or prior to attainment of age 55 and the tenth anniversary of the Participant’s

employment date, or prior to attainment of age 65 and the fifth anniversary of the Participant’s

employment, the Participant’s PEP Pension in excess of his Grandfathered Pension shall be payable in

a Single Lump Sum on the Participant’s Separation from Service.

(3)    2008 Reorganization. The entire PEP Pension of a Participant who (i) was involuntarily

Separated from Service on or after November 1, 2008 and on or before December 19, 2008; (ii) at the

(4)    Specified Employees. If a Participant is classified as a Specified Employee at the time of

the Participant’s Separation from Service (or at such other time for determining Specified Employee

status as may apply under Section 409A), then no amount shall be payable pursuant to this Section

6.1(b) until at least six (6) months after such a Separation from Service. Any payment otherwise due in

such six month period shall be suspended and become payable at the end of such six month period,

with interest at the applicable interest rates used for computing a Single Lump Sum payment on the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 172 -

(5)    Actual Date of Payment. An amount payable on a date specified in this Article VI or in

(a) the end of the calendar year in which the specified date occurs; or (b) the 15  day of the third

th

designate the taxable year of the payment. The payment date may be postponed further if calculation of

the amount of the payment is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the

Participant (or beneficiary), and the payment is made in the first calendar year in which the calculation

of the amount of the payment is administratively practicable.

6.2    Special Rules for Survivor Options.

(a)    Effect of Certain Deaths. If a Participant makes an Annuity election described in Section

6.1(b)(2) and the Participant dies before his Separation from Service, the election shall be disregarded.

Such a Participant may change his coannuitant of a Joint and Survivor Annuity at any time prior to his

Separation from Service, and may change his beneficiary of a Ten Years Certain and Life Annuity at any

time. If the Participant dies after such election becomes effective but before his non-Grandfathered PEP

Pension actually commences, the election shall be given effect and the amount payable to his surviving

Eligible Spouse, surviving Eligible Domestic Partner or other beneficiary shall commence on the first

day of the month following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his

estate). In the case of a Participant who elected a 10 Year Certain and Life Annuity, if such Participant

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 173 -

dies: (i) after benefits have commenced; (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary, and

(iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment, then the remaining payments due under

such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant’s estate. If payments have commenced under

such form of payment to a Participant’s primary or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies

before payments are completed, then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be

paid to such beneficiary’s estate.

(b)    Beneficiary Other Than Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner. If a Participant’s

beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner, he may not elect:

(1)    The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.1(b)(2) with a beneficiary more than

10 years younger than he is, or

(2)    The 75 percent survivor option described in Section 6.1(b)(2) with a beneficiary more than

19 years younger than he is.

6.3    Designation of Beneficiary. A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form

of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable

on his death. Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form. A Participant shall have the right to change or

revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his election is finally effective. The designation of any

beneficiary, and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan

Administrator. A beneficiary designation shall not be effective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator.

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 174 -

6.4    Determination of Single Lump Sum Amounts. Except as otherwise provided below, a Single Lump

Sum payable under Article V or Section 6.1 shall be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment

option prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan.

(a)    Vested Pensions. If on the date of Separation from Service of a Participant such Participant is not

entitled to retire with an immediate pension under the Salaried Plan, the Single Lump Sum payable to the

Participant under Section 6.1 shall be determined in the same manner as the single lump sum payment option

prescribed in Section 6.1(b)(3) of the Salaried Plan but substituting (for Plan Years beginning before 2012) the

applicable segment rates for the blended 30 year Treasury and segment rates that would otherwise be

applicable.

(b)    2008 Reorganization. Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Single Lump Sum payment for a

Participant whose employment was involuntarily terminated as a result of the 2008 Reorganization on or after

November 1, 2008 and on or before December 19, 2008 shall be determined based on the applicable interest

rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for optional lump sum distributions in December 2008, provided

that in no event shall such Single Lump Sum payment be less than the Single Lump Sum determined based

on the applicable interest rates and mortality used by the Salaried Plan for lump sum distributions for the

month in which the Single Lump Sum is distributed to the Participant.

6.5    Section 162(m) Postponement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, no

PEP Pension shall be paid to any Participant prior to the earliest date on which the Company’s federal income tax

deduction for such payment is not precluded by

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 175 -

Section 162(m) of the Code. In the event any payment is delayed solely as a result of the preceding restriction, such

payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the first date as of which Section 162(m) of the

Code no longer precludes the deduction by the Company of such payment. Amounts deferred because of the Section

162(m) deduction limitation shall be increased by simple interest for the period of delay at the annual rate of six

percent (6%).

APPENDIX TO ARTICLE PBG

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 176 -

(b)    Close of the Distribution Date. This term shall take the definition given it in the Agreement.

(c)    Transferred Individual. This term shall take the definition given it in the Agreement.

(d)    Transition Individual. This term shall take the definition given it in the Agreement.

IPO.3    Rights of Transferred and Transition Individuals. All Transferred Individuals who participated in the

PepsiCo Prior Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date shall be Participants in this Plan as of the Effective Date.

The spinoff of this Plan from the PepsiCo Prior Plan shall not result in a break in the Service or Credited Service of

Transferred Individuals or Transition Individuals. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, and as provided

in Section 2.04 of the Agreement, all service, all compensation, and all other benefit-affecting determinations for

Transferred Individuals that, as of the Close of the Distribution Date, were recognized under the PepsiCo Prior Plan

for periods immediately before such date, shall as of the Effective Date continue to receive full recognition, credit and

validity and shall be taken into account under this Plan as if such items occurred under this Plan, except to the extent

that duplication of benefits would result. Similarly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, the benefits of

Transition Individuals shall be determined in accordance with section 8.02 of the Agreement.

Article B – Special Cases

B.1    This Article B of the Appendix supplements the main portion of the Plan document and is effective as of

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 177 -

B.2    This Article shall apply to certain highly compensated management individuals who were (i) hired as a

Band IV on or about January 28, 2002 and (ii) designated by the Senior Vice President of Human Resources as

eligible to receive a supplemental retirement benefit (the “Participant”).

B.3    Notwithstanding Article IV of the Plan, the amount of the total PEP Pension under this Plan shall be

equal to the excess of (1) the monthly pension benefit which would have been payable to such individual under the

Salaried Plan without regard to the Compensation Limitation and the Section 415 Limitation, determined as if such

individual’s employment commencement date with the Company were September 10, 1990; (2) the sum of (i) the

amount of the monthly pension benefit that is in fact payable under the Salaried Plan; and (ii) the monthly amount of

such individual’s deferred, vested benefit under any qualified or nonqualified defined benefit pension plan maintained

by PepsiCo., Inc. or any affiliate of PepsiCo., Inc., Tricon or YUM!, as determined by the administrator using

reasonable assumptions to adjust for different commencement dates so that the total benefit of such individual does

not exceed the amount described in (1) above.

B.4    In the event of the death of such individual while employed by the Company, the individual’s beneficiary

shall be entitled to a death benefit as provided in Article V, determined based on the formula for the total benefit

described above, and reduced by the survivor benefits payable by the Salaried Plan and the other plans described

above. The net amount so determined shall be payable in a Single Lump Sum as prescribed in Article V.

B.5    The Plan Administrator shall, in its sole discretion, adjust any benefit determined pursuant to this Article

B to the extent necessary or appropriate to ensure that such individual’s benefit in the aggregate does not exceed the

Company’s intent to ensure overall pension

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 178 -

benefits equal to the benefits that would be applicable if such individual had been continuously employed by the

Company for the period commencing September 10, 1990 to the date of Separation from Service.

- 179 -

Article C – Transfers From/To PepsiCo, Inc.

transfer from the Company to PepsiCo, Inc.; and (ii) transfer from PepsiCo, Inc. to the Company.

C.2    Notwithstanding Article IV of the Plan, the PEP Pension of a Participant who (i) transfers from the

Company to PepsiCo., Inc. or (ii) transfers to PepsiCo, Inc. from the Company shall be determined as set forth below.

C.3    Transfers to PepsiCo, Inc. The PEP Pension of a Participant who transfers to PepsiCo, Inc. shall be

determined as of the date of such transfer in the manner described in Article IV, including the Salaried Plan offset

regardless of whether such benefit under the Salaried Plan is transferred to a qualified plan of PepsiCo, Inc. On such

Participant’s Separation from Service, the PEP Pension so determined shall become payable in accordance with

Article VI.

C.4    Transfers from PepsiCo, Inc. The PEP Pension of a Participant who transfers from PepsiCo, Inc. shall be

determined as of the date of the Participant’s Separation from Service in the manner described in Article IV and shall

be reduced by any benefit accrued by the Participant under any qualified or nonqualified plan maintained by PepsiCo,

Inc. that is based on credited service included in the determination of the Participant’s benefit under this Plan so that

the total benefit from all plans does not exceed the benefit the Participant would have received had the Participant

been solely employed by the Company. Notwithstanding the

PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program

- 180 -

preceding, effective for transfers on or after January 1, 2005, in no event shall such benefit be less than the benefit

the Participant would have received based solely on the Participant’s employment by the Company. The Plan
