Amcor reports fiscal 2023 results and provides outlook for fiscal 2024

June 2023 quarter:
GAAP diluted EPS of 12.3 cps; Adjusted EPS of 19.3 cps

Fiscal 2023 Full Year Highlights

• Net sales of $14,694 million, in line with the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis;

• GAAP Net Income of $1,048 million;  GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 70.5 cps;

• Adjusted EPS of 73.3 cps and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $848 million, in line with guidance provided in

May.  Adjusted EBIT of $1,608 million;

• Strong  total  cash  returns  to  shareholders  of  $1.2  billion:  annual  dividend  increased  to  49.0  cents  per

share; $431 million of shares repurchased (approximately 3% of outstanding shares); and

•

Fiscal  2024  outlook: Adjusted  EPS  of  67-71  cents  per  share.   Adjusted  Free  Cash  Flow  of  $850-950
million.

Amcor  CEO  Ron  Delia  said:  “Throughout  fiscal  2023,  our  teams  did  an  excellent  job  proactively  recovering
inflation and reducing costs in a highly challenging environment.  Adjusted EBIT grew modestly in comparable
constant currency terms and we returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders. After delivering earnings growth
of 8% in the first half, demand softened considerably and customer destocking persisted through the last two
quarters of the year.

While  we  expect  current  market  conditions  to  continue  in  the  near-term,  we  have  visibility  to  a  number  of
controllable factors we believe will support a return to solid earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2024 and
leave  us  well  placed  to  grow  at  our  long  term  trend  of  high-single  digit  rates  thereafter.    We  are  pricing  to
compensate for inflation and we expect benefits from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will have a
favorable and sustainable impact on operating leverage. In addition, we expect the headwinds from the sale of
our Russian plants and higher interest expense will be largely limited to the first half.

We remain focused on our long-term growth strategy and will continue to pursue opportunities to invest in the
business,  particularly  through  innovation  and  sustainability  initiatives  in  faster  growing,  higher  value  markets.
We  will  also  continue  pursuing  value-creating  M&A  and  returning  cash  to  shareholders  through  share
repurchases and a compelling and growing dividend.”

Cash Returns to Shareholders

Amcor  generates  significant  annual  cash  flow,  maintains  strong  credit  metrics,  and  is  committed  to  an  investment
grade credit rating. The Company's strong annual cash flow and balance sheet provide substantial capacity to reinvest
in  the  business  for  organic  growth,  pursue  acquisitions,  and  return  cash  to  shareholders  through  a  compelling  and
growing dividend as well as regular share repurchases.

During fiscal 2023, the Company returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders through cash dividends and share
repurchases in addition to completing three bolt-on acquisitions.

Dividend

The Amcor Board of Directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12.25 cents per share (compared with 12.0
cents per share in the same quarter last year).  Combined with the last three quarterly dividends, this increases the
annual  dividend  for  fiscal  2023  to  49.0  cents  per  share.    The  quarterly  dividend  declared  today  will  be  paid  in  US
dollars to holders of Amcor’s ordinary shares trading on the NYSE.  Holders of CDIs trading on the ASX will receive an
unfranked dividend of 18.77 Australian cents per share, which reflects the quarterly dividend of 12.25 cents per share
converted at an average AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.6526 over the five trading days ended August 14, 2023.

The ex-dividend date will be September 6, 2023, the record date will be September 7, 2023, and the payment date will
be September 27, 2023.

Share repurchases

Amcor repurchased approximately 41 million shares (approximately 3% of total shares issued and outstanding) during
fiscal 2023 for a total cost of $431 million.

Amcor expects to allocate approximately $70 million of cash towards share repurchases in fiscal 2024, as part of the
program previously announced in fiscal 2023.

Twelve months ended June 30, 2023

Net  sales  for  the  Amcor  Group  increased  by  1%  on  a  reported  basis,  which  includes  an  unfavorable  impact  of
approximately 3% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% related
to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $775 million (representing 5% growth) related to
the pass through of higher raw material costs.

Net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were in line with the prior year, largely reflecting price/mix benefits
of approximately 3%.  Full year volumes were approximately 3% lower than last year.

GAAP Net Income was $1,048 million and includes a $215 million gain on the sale of Amcor's business in Russia on
December 23, 2022.  Adjusted EBIT of $1,608 million was 1% higher than last year on a comparable constant currency
basis.    Adjusted  EBIT  margin  of  10.9%  includes  an  adverse  impact  of  approximately  90  basis  points  related  to
increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.

June 2023 quarter

Net sales for the Amcor Group of $3,673 million were 6% lower than last year on a reported basis.  This includes an
unfavorable impact of approximately 2% related to items affecting comparability and price increases of approximately
$25 million (representing 1% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs.  Movements in foreign
exchange rates had no material impact on net sales for the quarter.

Net  sales  on  a  comparable  constant  currency  basis  were  approximately  5%  lower  than  the  same  period  last  year.
Volumes  were  approximately  7%  lower  than  last  year.   This  was  partly  offset  by  price/mix  benefits  of  approximately
2%.

GAAP Net Income was $181 million.  Adjusted EBIT of $436 million was approximately 7% lower than last year on a
comparable constant currency basis.

Twelve months ended June 30, 2023
Net  sales  of  $11,154  million  were  in  line  with  last  year  on  a  reported  basis,  including  an  unfavorable  impact  of
approximately 4% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% related
to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $515 million (representing 5% growth) related to
the  pass  through  of  higher  raw  material  costs.    On  a  comparable  constant  currency  basis,  net  sales  were
approximately  1%  higher  than  last  year  reflecting  price/mix  benefits  of  4%,  partly  offset  by  approximately  3%  lower
volumes.

In North America, net sales were marginally lower than the prior year driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/
mix benefits. Volumes were higher in the healthcare, pet care, cheese, and home and personal care categories, and
this was more than offset by lower volumes in categories including condiments, meat, and ready meals.

In  Europe,  net  sales  grew  in  the  low  single  digit  range  driven  by  price/mix  benefits,  partly  offset  by  lower  volumes.
Volumes were lower in the coffee, home and personal care, yogurt and confectionary categories. This was partly offset
by higher volumes in the pet care and pharmaceutical categories.

Net sales were in line with the prior year across the Asia Pacific region, with price/mix benefits offset by lower volumes.
Volumes  were  lower  in  China  where  demand  was  unfavorably  impacted  by  COVID-19  related  lockdowns.    Sales
growth  remained strong in India, Australia, and the pan-Asian healthcare and meat end markets.  In Latin America, net
sales declined in the low single digit range driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits.

Adjusted  EBIT  of  $1,429  million  was  1%  higher  than  in  the  prior  period  on  a  comparable  constant  currency  basis,
reflecting  favorable  operating  cost  performance,  partly  offset  by  the  impact  of  lower  volumes  and  unfavorable  mix
trends.

Adjusted EBIT margin of 12.8% includes an adverse impact of approximately 100 basis points related to the increased
sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.

June 2023 quarter

Net  sales  of  $2,777  million  were  6%  lower  than  last  year  on  a  reported  basis,  including  a  favorable  impact  of
approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates, an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% related
to items affecting comparability, and price increases of approximately $25 million (representing 1% growth) related to
the pass through of higher raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately
5% lower than last year reflecting approximately 7% lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits of 2%.

3

Volume weakness was broad based with high single digit declines across the European and North American markets,
and a mid single digit decline in Latin America.  The volume decline in these regions reflects soft consumer demand as
well as customer destocking.  In Asia, overall volumes were in line with the same quarter last year.

Adjusted  EBIT  of  $387  million  was  lower  than  the  same  quarter  last  year  on  a  comparable  constant  currency  basis,
reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost
inflation.  These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.

Net  sales  of  $3,540  million  were  4%  higher  than  last  year  on  a  reported  basis,  including  an  unfavorable  impact  of
approximately 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and price increases of approximately $260 million
(representing 8% growth) related to the pass through of higher raw material costs.  On a comparable constant currency
basis, net sales were approximately 3% lower than last year, reflecting price/mix benefits of approximately 1% offset by
approximately 4% lower volumes.

In North America, overall beverage volumes were 6% lower than last year. Hot fill beverage container volumes were in
line  with  the  prior  year  as  new  business  wins  in  key  categories  offset  unfavorable  consumer  demand  and  customer
destocking.    Combined  preform  and  cold  fill  container  volumes  were  lower  than  the  prior  year.  Overall  specialty
container volumes were lower than the prior year with growth in the healthcare, dairy and nutrition categories offset by
weaker volumes in the food and home and personal care categories.

In Latin America, volumes declined at low single digit rates which reflects challenging economic conditions across the
region.

Adjusted EBIT of $265 million was lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower
volumes and unfavorable mix trends, partly offset by favorable operating cost performance.

Adjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points related to the increased
sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation.

June 2023 quarter

Net sales of $897 million were 5% lower than the same quarter last year on a reported basis including an unfavorable
impact  of  1%  related  to  movements  in  foreign  exchange  rates.  On  a  comparable  constant  currency  basis,  net  sales
were  4%  lower  than  last  year  reflecting  approximately  6%  lower  volumes,  partly  offset  by  price/mix  benefits  of
approximately 2%.

In  North  America,  overall  beverage  volumes  were  8%  lower  than  the  same  quarter  last  year  as  a  result  of  lower
consumer  demand  and  customer  destocking  more  than  offsetting  new  business  wins.    June  2023  quarter  hot  fill
beverage container volumes were 6% lower than last year, broadly in line with the market.

Adjusted  EBIT  of  $73  million  was  lower  than  the  same  quarter  last  year  on  a  comparable  constant  currency  basis,
reflecting lower volumes and heightened volatility in customer order patterns, unfavorable mix trends, and ongoing cost
inflation.  These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by benefits from price and cost reduction initiatives.

Net interest and income tax expense

For the year ended June 30, 2023, net interest expense of $259 million was $124 million higher than the same period
last year, reflecting higher interest rates.  GAAP income tax expense was $193 million compared with $300 million last
year.  Excluding amounts related to non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2023
was $250 million compared with $332 million in the prior year.  Adjusted tax expense represents an effective tax rate of
18.5% which is lower than 21.2% last year, primarily due to differences in the mix of taxable income and discrete items
in both periods.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Adjusted Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2023 was $848 million and compares with $1,066 million last year.  The year over
year variance largely reflects higher interest payments and lower accounts payable balances resulting from moderated
purchasing activities due to lower demand and inventory reduction initiatives.  June 2023 quarter Adjusted Free Cash
Flow of $834 million compares with $803 million in the same quarter last year.

Net  debt  was  $6,057  million  at  June  30,  2023.    Leverage,  measured  as  net  debt  divided  by  adjusted  trailing  twelve
month EBITDA, was 3.0 times and in line with the Company's expectations.

Fiscal 2024 Guidance

For the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2024, the Company expects:

•

Adjusted EPS of 67 to 71 cents per share which includes:

•

•

•

•

Comparable constant currency earnings which includes underlying business performance down low single
digit  %  to  up  low  single  digit  %,  a  benefit  of  approximately  2%  from  share  repurchases,  and  a  negative
impact of approximately 6% related to higher estimated net interest and tax expense;

A  negative  impact  of  approximately  3%  related  to  the  sale  of  the  Company's  three  plants  in  Russia  on
December 23, 2022; and

A benefit of approximately 2% related to currency translation, assuming current rates prevail through the
balance of fiscal 2024.

The Company expects adjusted EPS on a reported basis in the first half of fiscal 2024 to be down in the
mid-teens  %  compared  with  the  first  half  of  fiscal  2023,  primarily  due  to  lower  volumes  and  the  residual
headwinds related to the sale of the Russia plants and higher interest expense. In the second half of fiscal
2024, adjusted EPS is expected to be up mid-single digits % compared with the second half of fiscal 2023,
benefiting  in-part  from  structural  cost  saving  initiatives  and  increased  earnings  leverage  resulting  from
price and cost actions taken in fiscal 2023 and 2024.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow of approximately $850 million to $950 million, representing solid growth over fiscal
2023.

Approximately $70 million of cash to be allocated towards share repurchases as part of the program previously
announced in fiscal 2023.

Presentation of non-GAAP information

Included  in  this  release  are  measures  of  financial  performance  that  are  not  calculated  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  These  measures  include
adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA (calculated as earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortization), adjusted EBIT and EBIT (calculated
as earnings before interest and tax), adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and net debt.  In arriving at these non-
GAAP measures, we exclude items that either have a non-recurring impact on the income statement or which, in the judgment of our management,
are items that, either as a result of their nature or size, could, were they not singled out, potentially cause investors to extrapolate future performance
from  an  improper  base.  Note  that  while  amortization  of  acquired  intangible  assets  is  excluded  from  non-GAAP  adjusted  financial  measures,  the
revenue  of  the  acquired  entities  and  all  other  expenses  unless  otherwise  stated,  are  reflected  in  our  non-GAAP  financial  performance  earnings
measures. While not all inclusive, examples of these items include:

•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

material  restructuring  programs,  including  associated  costs  such  as  employee  severance,  pension  and  related  benefits,  impairment  of
property and equipment and other assets, accelerated depreciation, termination payments for contracts and leases, contractual obligations,
and any other qualifying costs related to restructuring plans;
material sales and earnings from disposed or ceased operations and any associated profit or loss on sale of businesses or subsidiaries;
changes in the fair value of economic hedging instruments on commercial paper;
significant pension settlements;
impairments in goodwill and equity method investments;
material acquisition compensation and transaction costs such as due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, and integration costs;
material purchase accounting adjustments for inventory;
amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combination;
gains or losses on significant property and divestitures and significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery;
certain regulatory and legal matters;
impacts from hyperinflation accounting; and
impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Amcor also evaluates performance on a comparable constant currency basis, which measures financial results assuming constant foreign currency
exchange  rates  used  for  translation  based  on  the  average  rates  in  effect  for  the  comparable  prior  year  period.  In  order  to  compute  comparable
constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, current-year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates
and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We then adjust for other items affecting
comparability. While not all inclusive, examples of items affecting comparability include the difference between sales or earnings in the current period
and  the  prior  period  related  to  acquired,  disposed,  or  ceased  operations.  Comparable  constant  currency  net  sales  performance  also  excludes  the
impact from passing through movements in raw material costs.

Management  has  used  and  uses  these  measures  internally  for  planning,  forecasting  and  evaluating  the  performance  of  the  Company’s  reporting
segments and certain of the measures are used as a component of Amcor’s Board of Directors’ measurement of Amcor’s performance for incentive
compensation  purposes.  Amcor  believes  that  these  non-GAAP  measures  are  useful  to  enable  investors  to  perform  comparisons  of  current  and
historical performance of the Company. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP
financial measure has been provided herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in
accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  The  Company  provides  guidance  on  a  non-GAAP  basis  as  we  are  unable  to  predict  with  reasonable  certainty  the
ultimate outcome and timing of certain significant forward-looking items without unreasonable effort.  These items include but are not limited to the
impact of foreign exchange translation, restructuring program costs, asset impairments, possible gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain
tax related events. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP earnings and cash flow
measures for the guidance period.

Dividends

Amcor has received a waiver from the ASX’s settlement operating rules, which will allow the Company to defer processing conversions between its
ordinary share and CDI registers from September 6, 2023 to September 7, 2023 inclusive.
