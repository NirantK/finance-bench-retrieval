Item 1. Business

PART I

The Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”),  is one of the world’s major
aerospace firms.

We are organized based on the products and services we offer. We operate in four reportable segments:

•

•

Commercial Airplanes (BCA);

Defense, Space & Security ( BDS );

• Global Services ( BGS );

•

Boeing Capital ( BCC ).

Commercial Airplanes Segment

This  segment  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  and  provides  fleet  support  services,  principally  to  the  commercial  airline
industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum
of global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and
the 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models. Development continues on certain 737 MAX derivatives and the 777X program.

Defense, Space & Security Segment

This  segment  is  engaged  in  the  research,  development,  production  and  modification  of  manned  and  unmanned  military  aircraft  and  weapons
systems for strike, surveillance and mobility, including fighter and trainer aircraft; vertical lift, including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; and commercial
derivative aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft. In addition, this segment is engaged in the research, development, production and
modification  of  the  following  products  and  related  services:  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  including  strategic  missile  and  defense
systems,  command,  control,  communications,  computers,  intelligence, surveillance  and reconnaissance  (C4ISR),  cyber and information  solutions,
and intelligence systems; satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and space exploration.

BDS'  primary  customer  is  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  ( U.S.  DoD  ).  Revenues  from  the  U.S.  DoD,  including  foreign  military  sales
through  the  U.S.  government,  accounted  for  approximately  86%  of  its  2018  revenues.  Other  significant  BDS  customers  include  the  National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.

This segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 Strike Eagle, P-8 programs, KC-46A
Tanker, and T-X Trainer. This segment produces rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, and V-22 Osprey. In
addition,  this  segment's  products  include  space  and  missile  systems  including:  government  and  commercial  satellites,  the  International  Space
Station,  Commercial  Crew,  missile  defense  and  weapons  programs,  and  Joint  Direct  Attack  Munition,  as  well  as  the  United  Launch  Alliance  joint
venture.

Global Services Segment

This segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers  worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace platforms and systems with a full
spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and
conversions, spare

1

Table of Contents

parts, pilot and maintenance training systems and services, technical and maintenance documents, and data analytics and digital services.

Boeing Capital Segment

BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers  have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overall
financing exposure. BCC ’s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale
or re-lease and investments.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition
to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government
has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance  of government contracts,  and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions
covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade
secrets,  and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  the
aggregate  are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  the
expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.

Employees

Total workforce level at December 31, 2018 was approximately 153,000 . As of December 31, 2018 , our principal collective bargaining agreements
were with the following unions:

Union

The International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers (IAM)

The Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace (SPEEA)

The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural
Implement Workers of America (UAW)

Status of the Agreements with Major Union

We have two major agreements; one expiring in June 2022 and one in
September 2024.

We have two major agreements expiring in Octo ber 2022.

We have one major agreement expiring in October 2022.

The  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  are
intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  are  focused  on  improving  our
processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with
greater value products.

BDS  faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  Raytheon
Company, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic
presence in the U.S.

2

Table of Contents

market  by  strengthening  their  North  American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In  addition,  certain  competitors  have
occasionally  formed  teams  with  other  competitors  to  address  specific  customer  requirements.  BDS  expects  the  trend  of  strong  competition  to
continue into 2019 .

The  commercial  and  defense  services  market  is  an  extremely  challenging  landscape  made  up  of  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products
and  services  which  span  the  life  cycle  of  our  defense  and  commercial  airplane  programs:  training,  fleet  services  and  logistics,  maintenance  and
engineering,  modifications  and  upgrades  -  as  well  as  the  daily  cycle  of  gate-to-gate  operations.  BGS  expects  the  market  to  remain  highly
competitive in 2019 , and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.

Regulatory Matters

Our  businesses  are  heavily  regulated  in  most  of  our  markets.  We  deal  with  numerous  U.S.  government  agencies  and  entities,  including  but  not
limited  to  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.
Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.

Government
Contracts.
The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well
as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for
convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our
government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  default,  generally  the  U.S.  government  would  pay  only  for  the  work  that  has  been  accepted  and
could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from
the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.

Commercial
Aircraft.
 In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations  governing  production  and  quality
systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist
for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each
country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities.

Environmental.
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the
discharge,  treatment,  storage,  disposal  and  remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  continually  assess  our  compliance  status  and
management  of  environmental  matters  to  ensure  our  operations  are  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.
Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal,
recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that
costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash
flows  if  additional  work  requirements  or  more  stringent  clean-up  standards  are  imposed  by  regulators,  new  areas  of  soil,  air  and  groundwater
contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.

A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP
by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost
of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for
which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory

3

Table of Contents

framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see
Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-U.S.
Sales.
 Our  non-U.S.  sales  are  subject  to  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  governmental  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and  practices,
including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S.
sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.

Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies

We  are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  most
important  raw materials  required for  our aerospace products  are aluminum (sheet,  plate, forgings and extrusions),  titanium  (sheet,  plate, forgings
and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of
the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis
with a number of companies.

Suppliers

We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality
standards  and  delivery  schedules  at  our  anticipated  costs.  While  we  maintain  an  extensive  qualification  and  performance  surveillance  system  to
control  risk  associated  with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affect
production  schedules  and  program/contract  profitability,  thereby  jeopardizing  our  ability  to  fulfill  commitments  to  our  customers.  We  are  also
dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

Forward-Looking Statements

This report, as well as our annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, and other filings we make with the SEC, press and earnings releases
and other written and oral communications, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of  1995.  Words  such  as  “may,”  “should,”  “expects,”  “intends,”  “projects,”  “plans,”  “believes,”  “estimates,”  “targets,”  “anticipates”  and  similar
expressions generally identify these forward-looking statements.  Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future
financial condition and operating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.

Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to be
accurate.  These  statements  are  not  guarantees  and  are  subject  to  risks,  uncertainties  and  changes  in  circumstances  that  are  difficult  to  predict.
Many factors, including those set forth in the “Risk Factors” section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in
our  other  filings  with  the  SEC,  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  and  adversely  from  these  forward-looking  statements.  Any  forward-
looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially
from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information
contained in this report.

Our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.

Market
conditions
have
a
significant
impact
on
demand
for
our
commercial
aircraft
and
related
services.
 The  commercial  aircraft  market  is
predominantly  driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  are
sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced
by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and
other  competitive  factors,  fuel  prices,  terrorism,  epidemics  and  environmental  regulations.  Traditionally,  the  airline  industry  has  been  cyclical  and
very  competitive  and  has  experienced  significant  profit  swings  and  constant  challenges  to  be  more  cost  competitive.  In  addition,  availability  of
financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States being fully operational. Significant deterioration in
the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer
new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could
result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog
consists  of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these  macroeconomic,  industry  or  customer  impacts  could
unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.

We
enter
into
firm
fixed-price
aircraft
sales
contracts
with
indexed
price
escalation
clauses
which
could
subject
us
to
losses
if
we
have
cost
overruns
or
if
increases
in
our
costs
exceed
the
applicable
escalation
rate.
Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft
are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a
fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on
current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can

5

Table of Contents

fluctuate  significantly  from  period  to  period.  Changes  in  escalation  amounts  can  significantly  impact  revenues  and  operating  margins  in  our
Commercial Airplanes business.

We
derive
a
significant
portion
of
our
revenues
from
a
limited
number
of
commercial
airlines.
 We can make  no assurance  that  any customer  will
exercise  purchase  options,  fulfill  existing  purchase  commitments  or  purchase  additional  products  or  services  from  us.  In  addition,  fleet  decisions,
airline  consolidations  or  financial  challenges  involving  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could significantly  reduce  our  revenues  and
limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.

Our  Commercial  Airplanes  business  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  a  healthy  production  system,  achieve  planned  production  rate
targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.

The  commercial  aircraft  business  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  with  U.S  and  non-U.S.  suppliers,  highly-
skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In
addition,  the  introduction  of  new  aircraft  programs  and/or  derivatives,  such  as  the  777X,  involves  increased  risks  associated  with  meeting
development,  testing,  production  and  certification  schedules.  As  a  result,  our  ability  to  deliver  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  regulatory  and  customer
requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.

We
must
minimize
disruption
caused
by
production
changes
and
achieve
productivity
improvements
in
order
to
meet
customer
demand
and
maintain
our
profitability.
We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging
in significant ongoing development and production of the 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building
our aircraft,  including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity  improvements,  and optimizing
how  we  manage  inventory.  If  production  rate  changes  at  any  of  our  commercial  aircraft  assembly  facilities  are  delayed  or  create  significant
disruption  to  our  production  system,  or  if  our  suppliers  cannot  timely  deliver  components  to  us  at  the  cost  and  rates  necessary  to  achieve  our
targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.

Operational
challenges
impacting
the
production
system
for
one
or
more
of
our
commercial
aircraft
programs
could
result
in
production
delays
and/or
failure
to
meet
customer
demand
for
new
aircraft,
either
of
which
would
negatively
impact
our
revenues
and
operating
margins.
 Our
commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet
internal  performance  plans,  or  delays  or  failures  to  achieve  required  regulatory  certifications,  could  result  in  significant  out-of-sequence  work  and
increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support
costs.

If
our
commercial
airplanes
fail
to
satisfy
performance
and
reliability
requirements,
we
could
face
additional
costs
and/or
lower
revenues.
Developing
and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory
agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any
Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.

Changes  in  levels  of  U.S.  government  defense  spending  or  overall  acquisition  priorities  could  negatively  impact  our  financial  position
and results of operations.

We  derive  a  substantial  portion  of  our  revenue  from  the  U.S.  government,  primarily  from  defense  related  programs  with  the  United  States
Department of Defense ( U.S. DoD ). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as
the political environment, U.S.

6

Table of Contents

foreign  policy,  macroeconomic  conditions  and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  government  to  enact  relevant  legislation  such  as  authorization  and
appropriations bills.

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised preexisting spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19). The consolidated spending
bills  signed  into  law  in  September  2018  provide  defense  funding  for  FY19.  However,  other  departments  and  agencies,  including  the  National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are being temporarily funded at FY18 levels. Failure
to  enact  a  Continuing  Resolution  or  FY19  appropriations  by  February  15,  2019  would  result  in  a  partial  government  shutdown  affecting  these
departments  and  agencies.  Such  a  shutdown  could  impact  the  Company’s  operations.  In  addition,  reduced  discretionary  spending  limits  initially
enacted  in  2011  would  take  effect  again  in  fiscal  years  2020  and  2021  (FY20  and  FY21)  unless  Congress  acts  to  raise  the  spending  caps  or  to
repeal or suspend the law establishing the reduced limits. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain
and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure.

In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government
agencies  (including  NASA)  within  the  overall  budgetary  framework  described  above.  While  the  House  and  Senate  Appropriations  Committees
included  funding  for  Boeing’s  major  programs,  such  as  F/A-18  Super  Hornet,  CH-47  Chinook,  AH-64  Apache,  V-22  Osprey,  KC-46A  Pegasus
Tanker and P-8 Poseidon, in their final FY19 defense appropriations, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY20 and beyond will affect
Boeing’s  programs.  Future  budget  cuts  or  investment  priority  changes,  including  changes  associated  with  the  authorizations  and  appropriations
process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect
on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.

In  addition,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  levels  and  the  nature  of  the  threat
environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can
no  longer  adjust  successfully  to  these  changing  acquisition  priorities  and/or  fail  to  meet  affordability  targets  set  by  the  U.S.  DoD  customer, our
revenues and market share would be further impacted.

We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.

In 2018 , 31% of  our  revenues  were  earned  pursuant  to  U.S.  government  contracts,  which  include  foreign  military  sales  (FMS)  through  the  U.S.
government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.

Our

regulations,
and

New
procurement  regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  the
operating  margins  of  our  BDS  and  BGS  businesses.  These  requirements  may  result  in  increased  compliance  costs,  and  we  could  be  subject  to
additional  costs  in  the  form  of  withheld  payments  and/or  reduced  future  business  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  these  requirements  in  the  future.
Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition
and operating results.

The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or
terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition,
funding  pursuant  to  our  U.S.  government  contracts  may  be  reduced  or  withheld  as  part  of  the  U.S.  Congressional  appropriations  process  due  to
fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other

reasons.  Further  uncertainty  with  respect  to  ongoing  programs  could  also  result  in  the  event  that  the  U.S.  government  finances  its  operations
through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction
of  expected  funding  and/or  modification,  curtailment,  or  termination  of  one  or  more  large  programs  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our
earnings, cash flow and/or financial position.

We
are
subject
to
U.S.
government
inquiries
and
investigations,
including
periodic
audits
of
costs
that
we
determine
are
reimbursable
under
U.S.
government
contracts.
U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit  Agency  and the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,
routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable
laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to
be  misclassified  or  inaccurately  allocated  to  a  specific  contract  will  be  deemed  non-reimbursable,  and  to  the  extent  already  reimbursed,  must  be
refunded.  Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.
Furthermore,  if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  and
administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from
doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such
allegations are later determined to be false.

We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.

Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 65% and 77% of their 2018 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price
contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins
or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve  estimated  costs  and  revenues.  If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize
reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2018, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling $736
million  on  the  USAF  KC-46A  Tanker  contract  primarily  reflecting  higher  estimated  costs  associated  with  certification,  testing  and  change
incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. In
addition, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 million associated with options
for 346 T-X Trainer aircraft and a loss of $291 million related to the MQ-25 Stingray Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract.
The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-
price contracts  often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance  which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on
margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.

Fixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  development
programs  have  highly  complex  designs.  In  addition,  technical  or  quality  issues  that  arise  during  development  could  lead  to  schedule  delays  and
higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS
fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker , T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25
Stingray, and commercial and military satellites.

We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.

Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 35% and 23% of their 2018 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements.
Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or
incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in
reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical

8

Table of Contents

performance issues arise. Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type include GMD , Proprietary and SLS programs.

We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.

Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments
may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is
at  risk  if  the  satellite  does  not  perform  to  specifications  for  up  to  15  years  after  acceptance.  The  net  present  value  of  in-orbit  incentive  fees  we
ultimately  expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,
customers  will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incur
significant charges.

Our  ability  to  deliver  products  and  services  that  satisfy  customer  requirements  is  heavily  dependent  on  the  performance  and  financial
stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components.

We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components
and  sub-assemblies,  and  production  commodities  and  to  perform  some  of  the  services  that  we  provide  to  our  customers.  If  one  or  more  of  our
suppliers  or  subcontractors  experiences  financial  difficulties,  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meet
commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. For example, the 737 program experienced supply chain disruptions in 2018 that impacted
the timing of certain deliveries during the year. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or
composites)  becomes  unavailable  or  is  available  only  at  very  high  prices,  we  may  be  unable  to  deliver  one  or  more  of  our  products  in  a  timely
fashion  or  at  budgeted costs.  In some  instances,  we depend upon  a single  source  of supply.  Any service  disruption  from  one of  these  suppliers,
either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial
difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.

We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial
results.

Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule
and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is
complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because
costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to
performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess
anticipated performance. Suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are
also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.

With  respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-
recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A
program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for
delivery  under  existing  and  anticipated  contracts  limited  by  the  ability  to  make  reasonably  dependable  estimates.  To  establish  the  relationship  of
sales to cost of sales, program

9

Table of Contents

accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably
be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine
warranty  costs  for  the  total  program.  Several  factors  determine  accounting  quantity,  including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective
customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices,
costs  of  derivative  aircraft,  supplier  performance,  customer  and  supplier  negotiations/settlements,  supplier  claims  and/or  certification  issues  can
impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance.

Because  of  the  significance  of  the  judgments  and  estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and  profit  amounts  could  be
recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or
estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and
profits, see our discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting”
on pages 43 – 44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 54 – 66 of this Form 10-K.

Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales.

The  markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specialized
engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing
competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry
consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our U.S. DoD and non-U.S.
customers  will intensify competition for many of our BDS products.  Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and
non-U.S.  competitors  facing  BCA  and  BDS.  Furthermore,  we  are  facing  increased  international  competition  and  cross-border  consolidation  of
competition.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  compete  successfully  against  our  current  or  future  competitors  or  that  the
competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.

In 2018 , non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately 56% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue
to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally,
including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

changes in regulatory requirements;

U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  policies,  including  requirements  to  expend  a  portion  of  program  funds  locally  and  governmental  industrial
cooperation or participation requirements;

fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;

volatility  in  international  political  and  economic  environments  and  changes  in  non-U.S.  national  priorities  and  budgets,  which  can  lead  to
delays or fluctuations in orders;

the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;

the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank
of the United States;

uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;

10

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;

the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;

compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and

unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.

While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.

Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.

We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive
network of technical security controls, policy enforcement  mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these
threats.  While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,
including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and
information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized
access, release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged,
and/or we could face financial losses.

The  outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adverse
decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.

We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to
benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these
lawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive
regulation  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  its  various  states,  as  well  as  other  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  As  a  result,  we  are
sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S.
government,  the  heavily  regulated  nature  of  our  industry,  and in  the  case  of  environmental  proceedings,  our  current  or  past  ownership  of  certain
property.  Any  such  inquiry  or  investigation  could  potentially  result  in  an  adverse  ruling  against  us,  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our
financial position and results of operations.

A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft,
which exposes us to concentration risks.

A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is
also  concentrated  by  varying  degrees  across  Boeing  aircraft  product  types,  most  notably  717  and  747-8  aircraft,  and  among  customers  that  we
believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial
difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable
terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or
financial position could be materially adversely affected.

We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable
terms or in sufficient amounts.

We  depend,  in  part,  upon  the  issuance  of  debt  to  fund  our  operations  and  contractual  commitments.  As  of  December  31,  2018  and  2017  , our
airplane financing commitments totaled $19,462 million and $10,221 million . If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing
commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased
borrowing  costs  and  to  have  greater  difficulty  accessing  public  and  private  markets  for  debt.  These  factors  include  disruptions  or  declines  in  the
global  capital  markets  and/or  a  decline  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit  ratings.  The  occurrence  of  any  or  all  of  these  events  may
adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.

As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. For example, in 2018
we  completed  the  acquisition  of  KLX  Inc.,  a  provider  of  aviation  parts  and  services.  Whether  we  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  from  these
acquisitions  and  related  activities  depends,  in  part,  upon  our  ability  to  integrate  the  operations  of  the  acquired  business,  the  performance  of  the
underlying  product  and  service  portfolio,  and  the  performance  of  the  management  team  and  other  personnel  of  the  acquired  operations.
Accordingly,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely  affected  by  unanticipated  performance  issues,  legacy  liabilities,  transaction-related  charges,
amortization  of  expenses  related  to  intangibles,  charges  for  impairment  of  long-term  assets,  credit  guarantees,  partner  performance  and
indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we
have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be
successful.  We  also  may  make  strategic  divestitures  from  time  to  time.  These  transactions  may  result  in  continued  financial  involvement  in  the
divested  businesses,  such  as  through  guarantees  or  other  financial  arrangements,  following  the  transaction.  Nonperformance  by  those  divested
businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.

Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.

We  are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  some
circumstances,  we  may  receive  indemnification  from  the  U.S.  government.  The  amount  of  our  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  claims  or
liabilities  and  we  may  be  forced  to  bear  substantial  costs.  For  example,  liabilities  arising  from  the  use  of  certain  of  our  products,  such  as  aircraft
technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on
commercially  reasonable  terms.  While  some  of  these  products  are  shielded  from  liability  within  the  U.S.  under  the  SAFETY  Act  provisions  of  the
2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance
coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.

Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.

Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging
weather  or  other  acts  of  nature  and  pandemics  or  other  public  health  crises.  Any  of  these  disruptions  could  affect  our  internal  operations  or  our
ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper

12

Table of Contents

use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of
Boeing and of our products and services.

Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.

Approximately 54,000 employees, which constitute 35% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2018 . We experienced
a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional work
stoppages  in  the  future,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business.  We  cannot  predict  how  stable  our  relationships,  currently  with  11 U.S. labor
organizations  and  13  non-U.S.  labor  organizations,  will  be  or  whether  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the  unions’  requirements  without  impacting  our
financial  condition.  The  unions  may  also  limit  our  flexibility  in  dealing  with  our  workforce.  Union  actions  at  suppliers  can  also  affect  us.  Work
stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships
with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.

Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash
flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.

The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory
amounts  required  under the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  and  discretionary  contributions  to  improve  the  plans  ' funded status. The
extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future
contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect
on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders ' equity. For U.S. government
contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We
also  provide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  and
qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level
of  medical  cost  increases.  For  a  discussion  regarding  how  our  financial  statements  can  be  affected  by  pension  and  other  postretirement  plan
accounting policies, see “ Management ' s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Pension Plans ” on page 45 of this Form 10-K.
Although Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) expense and pension or other postretirement  benefit
contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we
would contribute to our plans.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.

We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge,
treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines
and  civil  or  criminal  sanctions,  as  well  as  third-party  claims  for  property  damage  or  personal  injury,  if  we  were  to  violate  or  become  liable  under
environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past
manufacturing  operations  or  the  operations  of  companies  we  have  acquired.  In  other  cases,  we  may  become  subject  to  such  costs  due  to  an
indemnification  agreement  between  us  and  a  third  party  relating  to  such  environmental  liabilities.  In  addition,  new  laws  and  regulations,  more
stringent  enforcement  of  existing  laws  and  regulations,  the  discovery  of  previously  unknown  contamination  or  the  imposition  of  new  remediation
requirements  could result  in additional  costs.  For  additional  information  relating  to  environmental  contingencies,  see Note  14 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Overview

We are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites,
missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the
worldwide  commercial  airline  industry  and  one  of  the  largest  defense  contractors  in  the  U.S.  While  our  principal  operations  are  in  the  U.S.,  we
conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.

Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes ( BCA ), Defense, Space & Security ( BDS ),
and Global Services ( BGS ) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital ( BCC ). Taken together, these core businesses have historically
generated  substantial  earnings  and  cash  flow  that  permit  us  to  invest  in  new  products  and  services.  We  focus  on  producing  the  products  and
providing  the  services  that  the  market  demands,  and  continue  to  find  new  ways  to  improve  efficiency  and  quality  to  provide  a  fair  return  for  our
shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency
and value  to  customers  around  the  world.  BDS integrates  its  resources  in defense,  intelligence,  communications,  security,  space  and services  to
deliver  capability-driven  solutions  to  customers  at  reduced  costs.  Our  BDS  strategy  is  to  leverage  our  core  businesses  to  capture  key  next-
generation  programs  while  expanding  our  presence  in  adjacent  and  international  markets,  underscored  by  an  intense  focus  on  growth  and
productivity.  BGS  provides  support  for  commercial  and  defense  through  innovative,  comprehensive,  and  cost-competitive  product  and  service
solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.

Revenues in 2018 increased by $7,122 million or 8% compared with 2017 due to higher revenues at BCA, BDS, and BGS. BCA revenues increased
by $2,701 million due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries .
BDS revenues increased by $2,634 million primarily due to non-US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale
and higher  satellites  revenue  .  BGS  revenues  increased by $2,437 million due to growth  across  our  services  portfolio,  primarily  driven  by  higher
parts revenue including the acquisition of KLX Inc. (KLX). The increases at BCA, BDS, and BGS were partially offset by lower unallocated revenue.

Revenues in 2017 increased by $509 million or 1% compared with 2016. BDS revenues increased by $381 million primarily due to higher weapons
revenue. BGS revenues increased by $762 million primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue. The increases at BDS and BGS were partially
offset by lower BCA revenues, primarily due to delivery mix,  with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting  the impact of higher single aisle
deliveries .

The  changes  in  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other  in  2018 , 2017 and 2016 primarily  reflect  the  timing  of  eliminations  for  intercompany
aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.

** Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See page 40 .

Earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $1,643 million compared with 2017 , primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, which more
than offset the decrease at BDS and the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,427
million in 2018 due to higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins,
improved  cost  performance  and  favorable  delivery  mix.  BGS  earnings  from  operations  increased by $276  million  in 2018 primarily  due  to  higher
revenues, partially offset by higher period costs . BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared with 2017 as earnings’
growth from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 competitions, as well as
$199 million of higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forward losses .

Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,817 million compared with 2016 due to higher earnings at BCA and BDS, partially offset by the
change  in  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other.  BCA  earnings  from  operations  increased  by  $3,471  million  in  2017  primarily  due  to  lower
reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance. In 2016, BCA recorded
reach-forward losses of $1,258 million on the 747 program and reclassified $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft inventory costs to research and
development. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of our determination that two 787
flight  test  aircraft  were  no  longer  commercially  saleable.  BDS  earnings  from  operations  increased  by  $515  million  in  2017  primarily  due  to  lower
charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016 , we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2018 , we recorded charges of $736 million , of
which $500 million was recorded at BCA, $222 million at BDS , and $14 million at BGS. During 2017 , we recorded charges of $445 million : $378
million at BCA, $44 million at BGS, and $23 million at BDS. During 2016 , we recorded charges of $1,127 million : $772 million at BCA and $351
million at BDS.

Core operating earnings for 2018 increased by $1,754 million compared with 2017 primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, partially offset
by lower earnings at BDS and higher unallocated expenses.

Deferred compensation expense decreased by $221 million in 2018 and increased  by $194 million in 2017, primarily  driven  by changes in broad
stock market conditions and our stock price.

Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $537 million in 2018 primarily due to timing of expense allocations, higher research and
development  expense  and  a  $148  million  charge  incurred  related  to  the  outcome  of  the  Spirit  litigation.  See  the  discussion  in  Note  13  to  our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $187 million in 2017 primarily due to the timing of expense allocations.

A portion of service cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the
reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods.

Net periodic pension benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:

The  pension  FAS/CAS  service  cost  adjustment  recognized  in  earnings  in  2018,  2017,  and  2016  were  largely  consistent  across  all  periods.  The
decrease in net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations in 2017 was primarily due to lower service costs reflecting the transition
of employees in 2016 to defined contribution retirement savings plans.

Other  income/(loss),  net  decreased by $31  million  in 2018 primarily  due  to  lower  gains  from  foreign  exchange,  partially  offset  by  higher  interest
income. Other income/(loss), net increased by $561 million in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in non-operating pension and postretirement costs
and higher gains from foreign exchange. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143 million in
2018 and $117  million  in 2017 ,  compared  with  an  expense  of  $327  million  in 2016 .  The  benefits  in  2018  and  2017  reflect  expected  returns  in
excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. The expense in 2016 reflects the amortization of non-service costs previously capitalized
as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of expected returns.

Interest and debt expense increased by $115 million in 2018 as a result of higher debt balances and lower capitalized interest and increased by $54
million in 2017 as a result of lower capitalized interest.

For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)

Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.
Our  BCA  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales.  Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  each
commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales
percentage  applicable  to  the  total  remaining  program.  For  long-term  contracts,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.
Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at our BGS segment are
long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Costs on these contracts are recorded
as incurred.

Research and development expense in 2017 decreased by $1,447 million compared with 2016 primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million
of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft as well as lower spending on the 737 MAX,

Contractual  backlog  of  unfilled  orders  excludes  purchase  options,  announced  orders  for  which  definitive  contracts  have  not  been  executed,  and
unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2018 was primarily due to BDS orders and
funding for contract awards in excess of revenue recognized.

Unobligated  backlog  includes  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  definitive  contracts  for  which  funding  has  not  been  authorized.  The  increase  in
unobligated backlog in 2018 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS
contracts.

Additional Considerations

KC-46A  Tanker  In  2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  ( USAF )  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next
generation  aerial  refueling  tankers.  The  KC-46A  Tanker  is  a  derivative  of  our  767  commercial  aircraft.  This  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and
Development  (EMD)  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  valued  at  $4.9  billion  and  involves  highly  complex  designs  and  systems
integration. In 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at
$2.8  billion,  and  in  2017,  the  USAF  authorized  an  additional  LRIP  lot  for  15  aircraft  valued  at  $2.1  billion.  On  September  10,  2018,  the  USAF
authorized an additional LRIP lot for 18 aircraft valued at $2.9 billion. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and

23

Table of Contents

full  rate  production  aircraft.  If  all  options  under  the  contract  are  exercised,  we  expect  to  deliver  179  aircraft  for  a  total  expected  contract  value  of
approximately $30 billion. In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the USAF .

During 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,127 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2017, we recorded reach-
forward  losses  of  $445  million  related  to  this  program,  primarily  reflecting  higher  estimated  costs  associated  with  certification  and  incorporating
changes  into  LRIP  aircraft.  During  2018,  we  recorded  additional  reach-forward  losses  of  $736  million  primarily  reflecting  higher  estimated  costs
associated with certification, flight testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements
in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses
and/or delivery delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues, and delays in flight testing, certification and/or delivery.

Export-Import  Bank  of  the  United  States  Many  of  our  non-U.S.  customers  finance  purchases  through  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  the  United
States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now
authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of
directors,  the  bank  will  not  be  able  to  approve  any  transaction  totaling  more  than  $10  million.  As  a  result,  we  may  fund  additional  commitments
and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot
obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers.  We
continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternative
third party financing sources.

Global Trade On June 1, 2018, the U.S. Government began imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several
major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. We continue to monitor the potential for any
extra costs that may result from these actions.

On  July  6,  2018,  the  U.S.  and  China  began  imposing  tariffs  on  approximately  $34  billion  of  each  other's  exports.  Certain  aircraft  parts  and
components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. Subsequently, the U.S. imposed tariffs on an additional $216 billion in Chinese goods,
and China imposed tariffs on an additional $76 billion worth of U.S goods. On December 1, 2018, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day timetable
to negotiate a resolution to the trade dispute. We continue to monitor the potential for any disruption and adverse revenue and/or cost impacts that
may result from these actions or future geopolitical economic developments.

The  U.S.  Government  continues  to  impose  and/or  threaten  to  impose  sanctions  on  certain  businesses  and  individuals  in  Russia.  Although  our
operations  or  sales  in  Russia  have  not  been  impacted  to  date,  we  continue  to  monitor  additional  sanctions  that  may  be  imposed  by  the  U.S.
Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers.

Business Environment and Trends

Airline Industry Environment Global  economic  growth,  a  primary  driver  for  air  travel,  was  above  the  long-term  average  of  approximately  3%  in
2018.  Passenger  traffic  is  estimated  to  grow  by  6.5%  in  2018,  exceeding  the  long-term  average  of  approximately  5%.  While  growth  was  strong
across  all  major  world  regions,  there  continues  to  be  variation  between  regions  and  airline  business  models.  Airlines  operating  in  Asia  Pacific,
Europe  and  North  America,  as  well  as  low-cost-carriers  globally,  are  currently  leading  the  growth  in  passenger  traffic.  Air  cargo  traffic  growth  is
expected to be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2018, around the long-term average.

Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances,
partnerships,  new marketing  initiatives,  and effective  leveraging of ancillary services  and related revenues.  Airlines  are also focusing on reducing
costs and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits in 2018 are expected to approximate $32 billion.

The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth and the
increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between
countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on
long-term global economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.3 trillion market for approximately 42,700 new
airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts
of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations.

Industry  Competitiveness  The  commercial  jet  airplane  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  Market  liberalization  in
Europe,  the  Middle  East  and  Asia  is  enabling  low-cost  airlines  to  continue  gaining  market  share.  These  airlines  are  increasing  the  pressure  on
airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure
a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.

Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately
88% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines.

We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to
most  of  the  same  customers  and  suppliers.  With  government  support,  Airbus  has  historically  invested  heavily  to  create  a  family  of  products  to
compete with ours. Regional jet makers, Embraer and Bombardier, continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable airplanes.
During  2018,  Airbus  acquired  a  majority  share  of  Bombardier’s  C  Series  (now  A220)  and  is  in  the  100-150  seat  transcontinental  market,  while
Embraer’s  first  E195-E2  delivered  in  2018.  Additionally,  other  competitors  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan  are  developing  commercial  jet  aircraft.
Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces
the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without commercial
viability;  others  to  be  brought  to  market  more  quickly  than  otherwise  possible;  and  many  offered  for  sale  below  market-based  prices.  Many
competitors  have  continued  to  make  improvements  in  efficiency,  which  may  result  in  funding  product  development,  gaining  market  share  and
improving  earnings.  This  market  environment  has  resulted  in  intense  pressures  on  pricing  and  other  competitive  factors,  and  we  expect  these
pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.

BCA revenues increased by $2,701 million or 5% in 2018 compared with 2017 due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries  and favorable 737 and 787
model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries . BCA revenues decreased by $1,364 million or 2% in 2017 compared with 2016
primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries .

Earnings From Operations

Earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $2,427 million compared with 2017 . The increase in operating earnings reflects higher revenues
and  improved  operating  margins.  The  increase  in  operating  margins  is  primarily  due  to  higher  787  margins,  improved  cost  performance  and
favorable delivery mix.

Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,471 million compared with 2016 . The increase in operating earnings and operating margins is
primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance,
which  more  than  offset  the  impact  of  lower  revenues.  Research  and  development  expense  in 2016  reflects  the  reclassification  from  inventory  to
research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the
777X program.

Table of Contents

Reach-forward  losses  of  $500  million  , $378  million  and $772  million  were  recorded  related  to  the  KC-46A  Tanker  in  2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,
respectively. During 2016 , we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million.

Backlog

Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where
we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to
perform.  Backlog  does  not  include  prospective  orders  where  customer  controlled  contingencies  remain,  such  as  the  customer  receiving  approval
from  its  board  of  directors,  shareholders  or  government  or  completing  financing  arrangements.  All  such  contingencies  must  be  satisfied  or  have
expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A number
of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other
contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is
reported in accordance with the requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).

BCA total backlog of $412,307 million at December 31, 2018 increased from $410,986 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to net orders in
excess of deliveries.

Accounting  Quantity  The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  and
anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue
and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a
program’s  life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  that
program,  including  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective  customers  and  market  studies.  We  review  our  program  accounting  quantities
quarterly.

The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be
under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity
must be considered.

Program Highlights

737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2018 due to the program ’ s normal progress of obtaining
additional orders and delivering airplanes. We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017, announced the launch of the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017
and delivered the first 737 MAX 9 in March 2018. The production rate increased from 47 per month to 52 per month in the second quarter of 2018,
however the timing of deliveries in 2018 was adversely affected by delays in the supply chain. We continue to plan to increase the production rate to
57 per month in 2019.

747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2018, we received a firm order for 4 new aircraft and increased the accounting quantity by 4 units to 1,574
aircraft. The program accounting quantity now includes aircraft scheduled to be produced through 2022. We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5
aircraft per month having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. In 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million as
lower than expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower than expected growth of global freight traffic resulted
in  lower  anticipated  revenues  from  future  sales  and  higher  costs  to  produce  fewer  airplanes.  We  continue  to  evaluate  the  viability  of  the  747
program. We believe that a decision to end production of the 747 at the end of the current accounting quantity would not have a material impact on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

28

Table of Contents

767  Program  The  accounting  quantity  for  the  767  program  increased  by  24  units  during  the  first  quarter  of  2018  due  to  the  program's  normal
progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We
are currently producing at a rate of 2.5 per month and plan to increase to 3 per month in 2020.

777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 55 units during 2018 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining
additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 5 per month. In 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a
new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the
year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020.

787 Program The accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 200 units during 2018 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining
additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 12 per month and plan to increase to 14 per month in 2019. We
delivered the first 787-10 in March 2018.

Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.
Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life
of  the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  and
technical  data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately  1.0%  of  total
consolidated costs of products and services.

Additional Considerations

The  development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  with
suppliers  and highly-skilled  labor  from  employees  and other  partners.  Meeting  or  exceeding our performance  and reliability  standards,  as  well as
those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such
as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver
aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  performance  and  reliability  standards  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program  profitability  is  subject  to  significant
risks.  Factors  that  could  result  in  lower  margins  (or  a  material  charge  if  an  airplane  program  has  or  is  determined  to  have  reach-forward  losses)
include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation
factors  due  to  changes  in  the  inflation  rate  or  other  economic  indicators,  performance  or  reliability  issues  involving  completed  aircraft,  capital
expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new

production  capacity,  learning  curve,  additional  change  incorporation,  achieving  anticipated  cost  reductions,  flight  test  and  certification  schedules,
costs,  schedule  and  demand  for  new  airplanes  and  derivatives  and  status  of  customer  claims,  supplier  assertions  and  other  contractual
negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical
complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could
be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.

Defense, Space & Security

Business Environment and Trends

United States Government Defense Environment Overview

The Bipartisan  Budget Act  of  2018, passed in  February  2018, raised  the  2011  Budget Control  Act  spending caps for  fiscal  years  2018 and 2019
(FY18  and  FY19).  The  consolidated  spending  bills  signed  into  law  in  September  2018  provide  defense  funding  for  FY19,  in  compliance  with  the
revised caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agencies
not  covered  by  enacted  FY19  appropriations,  including  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  and  Federal  Aviation
Administration  (FAA),  remains  uncertain.  The  unfunded  departments  and  agencies  affected  by  the  partial  government  shutdown  (December  22,
2018  through  January  25,  2019)  are  now  covered  by  a  Continuing  Resolution  that  extends  funding  at  FY18  levels  through  February  15,
2019.  Congress  and  the  President  must  agree  to  FY19  appropriations  or  an  additional  Continuing  Resolution  to  fund  affected  departments  and
agencies beyond the February 15 deadline in order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdown
to the Company’s operations would increase as the shutdown continues.

There continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level  appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including
NASA. The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20
and FY21). The lower budget caps will take effect again in FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend
the law. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes
could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the
results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.

Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need
to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the
Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2018, 30% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.

Since  our  operating  cycle  is  long-term  and  involves  many  different  types  of  development  and  production  contracts  with  varying  delivery  and
milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative
of  future  operating  results.  In  addition,  depending  on  the  customer  and  their  funding  sources,  our  orders  might  be  structured  as  annual follow-on
contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of
future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.

BDS  revenues  in  2018  increased  by  $2,634  million  compared  with  2017  primarily  due  to  non-US  contract  awards  for  fighters,  higher  weapons
revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue . Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to revenue for 2018 were
$214 million lower than  the  comparable  period  in  the  prior  year,  reflecting  increased  unfavorable  adjustments  on the  KC-46A  Tanker  recorded  in
2018.

BDS revenues in 2017 increased by $381 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher weapons revenue. Net favorable cumulative contract
catch-up adjustments to revenue for 2017 were $81 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting decreased unfavorable
adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2017.

Earnings From Operations

BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared with 2017 as earnings’ growth from higher revenues was more than
offset  by  charges  of  $691  million  related  to  winning  the  T-X  Trainer  and  MQ-25  competitions,  as  well  as  $199  million  of  higher  KC-46A  Tanker
reach-forward losses . Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to earnings for 2018 were $315 million lower than the comparable
period in the prior year, driven by higher charges on development programs in 2018.

31

Table of Contents

BDS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $515 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and
Commercial  Crew  programs.  Higher  earnings  reflect  the  favorable  impact  of  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  which  were  $374  million  higher in
2017 than in 2016, primarily driven by lower charges on development programs in 2017.

BDS  earnings  from  operations  include  equity  earnings  of  $147  million  , $183  million  and $249  million  primarily  from  our  ULA  and  non-U.S.  joint
ventures in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

During  2018  ,  2017  and  2016  ,  BDS  recorded  charges  related  to  the  KC-46A  Tanker  contract  of  $222  million  ,  $23  million  and  $351  million  ,
respectively.

Backlog

Total backlog of $57,166 million at December 31, 2018 increase d by 30% from $44,049 million at December 31, 2017 , primarily due to current year
contract  awards  in  many  of  our  programs  greater  than  revenue  recognized.  Significant  orders  included  Satellites,  F/A-18  fighters,  Ground-based
Midcourse Defense, weapons, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, V-22 Osprey, CH-47 Chinook, MQ-25 Stingray and T-X Trainer.

Additional Considerations

Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have
cost-type  contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program
cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Examples  of  these  programs  include  Ground-based  Midcourse  Defense  ,
Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.

Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed priced proposals for
new  programs.  Examples  of  significant  fixed-price  development  programs  include  Commercial  Crew,  Saudi  F-15,  USAF  KC-46A  Tanker,  T-X
Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward
loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. In the third quarter, we were awarded contracts to develop the T-X Trainer
aircraft  with  complementary  devices  and  the  MQ-25  Stingray.  We  recorded  orders  of  $1,618  million  and  recognized  losses  of  $691  million
associated  with  these  contracts.  Many  development  programs  have  highly  complex  designs.  As  technical  or  quality  issues  arise  during
development,  we may  experience  schedule  delays  and  cost  impacts,  which  could  increase  our  estimated  cost  to  perform  the  work  or  reduce  our
estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing,
and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs
creates  financial  risk  as  additional  completion  costs  may  become  necessary  or  scheduled  delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger
termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-
forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.

T-X Trainer In September 2018, we were selected by the U.S. Air Force to build the next generation training capability, known as T-X. The program
includes  aircraft  and  simulators  as  well  as  support  and  ground  equipment.  The  contract  is  structured  as  an  indefinite  delivery/indefinite  quantity
(IDIQ) fixed-price contract with a minimum of 206 aircraft and a maximum of 475 aircraft. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract valued at $813
million and includes five aircraft and seven simulators, with a period of performance that runs through 2022. The production and support contracts
are  structured  as  options  that  begin  with  authorization  from  fiscal  year  2022  to  2034.  In  connection  with  winning  this  competition,  we  recorded  a
reach-forward loss of $400 million associated with anticipated losses on the options for 346 aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised.
We believe that our investment in this contract positions us for additional market opportunities for both trainer and light attack aircraft.

MQ-25 Stingray In August 2018, we were awarded an EMD contract to build the MQ-25 Stingray for the U.S. Navy. The EMD contract is a fixed-
price contract that includes development and delivery of four aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $805 million. In connection with winning
this competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 million. The period of performance runs from 2018 through 2024. The MQ-25 Stingray
is the U.S. Navy’s first operational carrier-based  unmanned aircraft, and we believe that our investment in this contract positions us for long-term
leadership in autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies along with additional market opportunities.

Global Services

Business Environment and Trends

The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training
and professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% annually.

As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and
extend  the  economic  lives  of  airplanes.  Airlines  are  using  data  analytics  to  plan  flight  operations  and  predictive  maintenance  to  improve  their
productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing
spares management to third parties.

Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S.
government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the
next  decade,  we  expect  U.S.  growth  to  remain  flat  and  non-U.S.  fleets,  led  by  Middle  East  and  Asia  Pacific  customers,  to  add  rotorcraft  and
commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced
over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.

BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 30 , which could restrict the
execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.

Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment
has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global
markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

Boeing Capital

Business Environment and Trends

BCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 totaled $2,792 million . A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is
related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing
aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.

BCC  provided  customer  financing  of  $601  million  and $480  million  during 2018 and 2017 .  While  we  may  be  required  to  fund  a  number  of  new
aircraft deliveries in 2019 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices
from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase further, including if the
Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions.

Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,700 western-built
commercial jet aircraft (6.7% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2018 , including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types.
Of these parked aircraft, approximately 2% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2017 and 2016 , 8.3% and 8.8% of the western-built
commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few
operators, are placed out of service.

BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and
notes, and other income. BCC ’s revenues in 2018 decreased by $33 million compared with 2017 primarily due to lower lease income driven by a
smaller portfolio, partially offset by gain on sale of assets. BCC ’s revenues in 2017 were consistent with 2016 .

Earnings From Operations

BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation
on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $35 million primarily due to lower revenues.
Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $55 million primarily due to lower asset impairment and depreciation expenses.

BCC ’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 decreased from December 31, 2017 , primarily due to $812 million of
note payoffs, asset sales and portfolio run-off, partially offset by new volume.

Aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $84 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2019 . We are seeking to
remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.

BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and
other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.

Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 billion during 2018 , compared with $13.3 billion during 2017 and $10.5
billion in 2016 . The increase of $2.0 billion in 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and lower spending on inventory, partially offset by lower
advances. The increase of $2.9 billion in 2017 was primarily driven by higher advances more than offsetting inventory increases.

36

Table of Contents

Advances and progress billings increase d by $2.6 billion in 2018 , increase d by $4.7 billion in 2017 and decrease d by $1.3 billion in 2016 . During
2017, our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included $14.4 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion
and $0.5 billion in cash. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2018 and 2016 .

Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $4.6 billion , $2.1 billion and $3.4 billion primarily due to
acquisitions during the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net of cash acquired were $3.2 billion in 2018 , compared
with $0.3 billion in 2017 and 2016 . Capital expenditures  totaled  $1.7 billion in both 2018 and 2017 , down from $2.6 billion in 2016 . We expect
capital expenditures in 2019 to be higher than 2018 . Net proceeds from investments was $0.3 billion in 2018 and insignificant in 2017 , compared
with net contributions to investments of $0.5 billion in 2016.

Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $11.7 billion during 2018 , an increase of $0.4 billion compared with 2017 primarily due
to higher dividend payments partially offset by higher net borrowings. Cash used by financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017 , an increase of
$1.8 billion compared with 2016 , primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividend payments. Net borrowings were $1.4 billion in 2018 , $1.1
billion in 2017 and insignificant in 2016 .

At December 31, 2018 and 2017 the recorded balance of debt was $13.8 billion and $11.1 billion of which $3.2 billion and $1.3 billion was classified
as  short-term.  At  December  31,  2018  and 2017 this included $2.5 billion of debt attributable  to BCC ,  of  which  $0.5 billion and $0.9 billion were
classified as short-term.

During 2018 and 2017 we  repurchased  26.1  million  and 46.1  million  shares  totaling  $9.0  billion  and $9.2  billion  through  our  open  market  share
repurchase program. In 2018 and 2017 , we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2018 ,
the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 17, 2018 , totaled $20 billion .

Capital Resources We  have  substantial  borrowing  capacity.  Any  future  borrowings  may  affect  our  credit  ratings  and  are  subject  to  various  debt
covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term  liquidity. At  December 31, 2018 and
2017 , commercial paper borrowings totaling $1,895 million and $600 million , which were supported by unused commitments under the revolving
credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. At December 31, 2018 , we had $5.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on
revolving  credit  line  agreements.  We  anticipate  that  these  credit  lines  will  primarily  serve  as  backup  liquidity  to  support  our  general  corporate
borrowing needs.

Financing  commitments  totaled  $19.5  billion  and  $10.2  billion  at  December  31,  2018  and  2017  .  The  increase  primarily  relates  to  commercial
airplane orders received in 2018. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue
to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of
outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In
addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration
of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30,
2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able
to  approve  any  transaction  totaling  more  than  $10  million.  As  a  result,  we  may  fund  additional  commitments  and/or  enter  into  new  financing
arrangements with customers.

In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable
resolution  of  litigation  or  other  loss  contingencies,  or  other  business  requirements,  we  expect  to  meet  increased  funding  requirements  by  issuing
commercial  paper  or  term  debt.  We  believe  our  ability  to  access  external  capital  resources  should  be  sufficient  to  satisfy  existing  short-term  and
long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility

37

Table of Contents

to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the
cost or availability of future borrowings under our commercial paper program or in the debt markets.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , our pension plans were $15.3 billion and $16.4 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee
Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) basis our plans are 96% funded at December 31, 2018 with minimal required contributions in 2019 . We
do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2019 . We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future
years.

At  December  31,  2018  ,  we  were  in  compliance  with  the  covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  a
limitation  on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leaseback  transactions  as  a  percentage  of  consolidated  net  tangible  assets  (as  defined  in  the  credit
agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to
have substantial borrowing capacity.

Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2018 , our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of $2,412 million , was $2,392 million .
For  further  discussion  of  income  taxes,  see  Note  6 to  our  Consolidated Financial Statements.  We  are not  able  to  reasonably estimate  the  timing  of  future  cash  flows
related to uncertain tax positions.

Pension  and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits  Pension  cash  requirements  are  based  on  an  estimate  of  our  minimum  funding  requirements,
pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based
on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.

Purchase  Obligations  Purchase  obligations  represent  contractual  agreements  to  purchase  goods  or  services  that  are  legally  binding;  specify  a
fixed,  minimum  or  range  of  quantities;  specify  a  fixed,  minimum,  variable,  or  indexed  price  provision;  and  specify  approximate  timing  of  the
transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position.

38

Table of Contents

Purchase  Obligations  Not  Recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position  Purchase  obligations  not  recorded  on  the
Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position  include  agreements  for  inventory  procurement,  tooling  costs,  electricity  and  natural  gas  contracts,
property,  plant  and  equipment,  customer  financing  equipment,  and  other  miscellaneous  production  related  obligations.  The  most  significant
obligation  relates  to  inventory  procurement  contracts.  We  have  entered  into  certain  significant  inventory  procurement  contracts  that  specify
determinable  prices  and  quantities,  and  long-term  delivery  timeframes.  In  addition,  we  purchase  raw  materials  on  behalf  of  our  suppliers.  These
agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for
such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion
of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers
for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program
and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our
best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.

Purchase  Obligations  Recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position  Purchase  obligations  recorded  on  the  Consolidated
Statements  of  Financial  Position  primarily  include  accounts  payable  and  certain  other  current  and  long-term  liabilities  including  accrued
compensation.

Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to
facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of
goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for
supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments
may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could
be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2018 , we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2018 , we
have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030 . Purchase order commitments associated with
industrial  participation  agreements  are  included  in  purchase  obligations  in  the  table  above.  To  be  eligible  for  such  a  purchase  order  commitment
from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.

Commercial  aircraft  financing  commitments  include  commitments  to  provide  financing  related  to  aircraft  on  order,  under  option  for  deliveries  or
proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on
historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no
assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States
continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingent Obligations

We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:

Legal  Various  legal  proceedings,  claims  and  investigations  are  pending  against  us.  Legal  contingencies  are  discussed  in  Note  22  to  our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental  Remediation  We  are  involved  with  various  environmental  remediation  activities  and  have  recorded  a  liability  of  $555  million  at
December 31, 2018 . For additional information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 15 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-GAAP Measures

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (
GAAP ) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute  for  the  related  GAAP  measures,  and  other  companies  may  define  such  measures  differently.  We  encourage  investors  to  review  our
financial  statements  and  publicly-filed  reports  in  their  entirety  and  not  to  rely  on  any  single  financial  measure.  Core  operating  earnings,  core
operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the
difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core
earnings  per  share  excludes  both  the  FAS/CAS  service  cost  adjustment  and  non-operating  pension  and  postretirement  expenses.  Non-operating
pension  and  postretirement  expenses  represent  the  components  of  net  periodic  benefit  costs  other  than  service  cost.  Pension  costs,  comprising
service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated

40

Table of Contents

to  BCA  and  certain  BGS  businesses  supporting  commercial  customers.  Pension  costs  allocated  to  BDS  and  BGS  businesses  supporting
government  customers  are  computed  in  accordance  with  U.S.  Government  Cost  Accounting  Standards  (CAS),  which  employ  different  actuarial
assumptions  and  accounting  conventions  than  GAAP.  CAS  costs  are  allocable  to  government  contracts.  Other  postretirement  benefit  costs  are
allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.

The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in earnings during 2018 was a benefit of $1,005 million , largely consistent with a benefit
of $1,127 million in 2017 and $1,029 million in 2016 . The non-operating pension expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143
million in 2018 and $117 million in 2017 , compared with an expense of $327 million in 2016 . The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns
in  excess  of  interest  cost  and  amortization  of  actuarial  losses.  The  expense  in  2016  reflects  the  amortization  of  non-service  costs  previously
capitalized as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of expected returns.

For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 21 of this Form 10-K and
see Note 23 to  our Consolidated  Financial Statements.  Management  uses core  operating  earnings,  core  operating  margin  and core  earnings  per
share  for  purposes  of  evaluating  and forecasting  underlying  business  performance.  Management  believes these  core  earnings  measures  provide
investors  additional  insights  into  operational  performance  as  unallocated  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  cost,  primarily  represent  costs
driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Section  219  of  the  Iran  Threat  Reduction  and  Syria  Human  Rights  Act  of  2012  and  Section  13(r)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as
amended,  require  disclosure  of  certain  activities,  transactions  or  dealings  relating  to  Iran  that  occurred  during  the  period  covered  by  this  report.
Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. In connection with the U.S.
withdrawal  from  the  Joint  Comprehensive  Plan  of  Action  (Iran  Nuclear  Agreement),  we  engaged  in  activities  during  the  third  quarter  that  were
required  to  unwind  and  terminate  all  agreements  with  Iranian  airlines  entered  into  prior  to  the  withdrawal.  These  activities  were  authorized  by  a
license  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  (OFAC),  and  generated  no  revenues  or  profits.  In  addition,  during  the  fourth  quarter  Iran
Aseman Airlines requested Boeing support, and we replied that the current laws of the United States do not permit Boeing to provide any services,
parts, or aircraft without a license from OFAC.

Critical Accounting Policies

Accounting for long-term contracts

Substantially  all  contracts  at  BDS,  certain  military  derivative  aircraft  contracts  at  BCA  and  certain  contracts  at  BGS  are  long-term  contracts.  Our
long-term  contracts  typically  represent  a  single  distinct  performance  obligation  due  to  the  highly  interdependent  and  interrelated  nature  of  the
underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.

Accounting  for  long-term  contracts  involves  a  judgmental  process  of  estimating  the  total  sales,  costs,  and  profit  for  each  performance  obligation.
Cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported
as cost of sales.

Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated
and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding
contract  options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  as
inflation  or  index-based  clauses).  The  majority  of  these  long-term  contracts  are  with  the  U.S.  government  where  the  price  is  generally  based  on
estimated  cost  to  produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be
reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  Total  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historical
performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and
schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.

Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these
estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales
and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an
adjustment  to  a  reach-forward  loss,  which  would  be  recorded  immediately  in  earnings.  For  the  years  ended  December  31,  2018 and 2016 net
unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by
$190 million and $263 million .  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017 ,  net  favorable  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments,  including  reach-forward
losses, across all long-term contracts increased Earnings from operations by $250 million .

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we
used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance,
or circumstances

43

Table of Contents

may  adversely  or  positively  affect  financial  performance  in  future  periods.  If  the  combined  gross  margin  for  all  long-term  contract  performance
obligations for all of 2018 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by
approximately  $297  million  .  In  addition,  a  number  of  our  fixed  price  development  contracts  are  in  a  reach-forward  loss  position.  Changes  to
estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.

Program Accounting

Program  accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  the  relationship  of  sales  to  costs  for  the  defined  program  accounting
quantity.  A  program  consists  of  the  estimated  number  of  units  (accounting  quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-term
production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make
reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of
sales  is  determined  by  applying  the  estimated  cost  of  sales  percentage  for  the  total  remaining  program  to  the  amount  of  sales  recognized  for
airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.

Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part
costs,  major  component  costs,  overhead  costs,  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs,  and  warranty  costs.  Estimation  of  the  accounting
quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters
of  intent  from  prospective  customers,  and  market  studies.  Total  estimated  program  sales  are  determined  by  estimating  the  model  mix  and  sales
price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices
for  all  undelivered  units  within  the  accounting  quantity  include  an  escalation  adjustment  for  inflation  that  is  updated  quarterly.  Cost  estimates  are
based  largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated  contracts  with  suppliers,  historical  performance  trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economic
projections.  Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/or
supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.

To  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Changes  in
estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from
undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the
accounting quantity. For example, in 2016, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $1,258 million on the 747 program.

The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program.
Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and
other  non-recurring  costs,  new  commercial  aircraft  programs,  such  as  the  787  and  777X  programs,  typically  have  lower  initial  margins  than
established  programs.  In  addition,  actual  costs  incurred  for  earlier  units  in  excess  of  the  estimated  average  cost  of  all  units  in  the  program
accounting  quantity  are  included  within  program  inventory  as  deferred  production  costs.  Deferred  production,  unamortized  tooling  and  other  non-
recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries
is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or
assumptions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  program  gross  margins.  If  the  combined  gross  margin  percentages  for  our  commercial  airplane
programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s

44

Table of Contents

operating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment
would have a $607 million impact on operating earnings.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments

We  test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  a
qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If
we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step
impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we
first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a
second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair
value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill
impairment.

We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of
future  sales  and  operating  costs,  based  primarily  on  existing  firm  orders,  expected  future  orders,  contracts  with  suppliers,  labor  agreements  and
general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.

The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the
date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.

We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2018 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2018 , we
estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in
the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment
charges in future periods.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade
names  acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  by  comparing  their  carrying  value  to  current  projections  of
discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents
the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible
assets.

Pension Plans

The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union
employees  transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans  effective  January  1,  2019.  Accounting  rules  require  an
annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount
rate  and  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.  Future  changes  in  assumptions  or  differences  between  actual  and  expected  outcomes  can
significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.

45

Table of Contents

The  following  table  shows  the  sensitivity  of  our  pension  plan  liability  and  net  periodic  cost  to  a  25  basis  point  change  in  the  discount  rate  as  of
December 31, 2018 .

Pension cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected
long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2018 net periodic pension cost by $154 million .

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We  have  financial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk,  principally  fixed-rate  debt  obligations,  and  customer  financing  assets  and
liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have
not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2018 ,
the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our
fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest
rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use
foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  and
receipts  related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  At
December  31,  2018  ,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  or
decreased our unrealized losses by $262 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,
such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions
being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as
“Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities
that  are  required  to  be  consolidated.  All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.  As  described  in  Note  23  ,
effective  July  1,  2017,  we  now  operate  in  four  reportable  segments:  Commercial  Airplanes  (BCA);  Defense,  Space  &  Security  (BDS),  Global
Services (BGS), and Boeing Capital (BCC). Amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  requires  management  to  make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those
estimates.

Operating Cycle

For  classification  of  certain  current  assets  and  liabilities,  we  use  the  duration  of  the  related  contract  or  program  as  our  operating  cycle,  which  is
generally longer than one year .

Standards Issued and Implemented

In  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  we  adopted  the  following  Accounting  Standards  Updates  (ASUs):  ASU  2014-09  ,  Revenue
from
Contracts
with
Customers
(Topic
606);
ASU 2017-07 , Compensation
-
Retirement
Benefits
(Topic
715):
Improving
the
Presentation
of
Net
Periodic
Pension
Cost
and
Net
Periodic
Postretirement
Benefit
Cost;
 ASU  2016-18  Statement
of
Cash
Flows
(Topic
230):
Restricted

 ASU  2018-02  ,  Income
Statement—Reporting
Comprehensive
Income
(Topic
220):
Reclassification
of
Certain
Tax
Effects
from
Accumulated
Other
Comprehensive
Income.

The impact of the adoption of these standards to our Consolidated Financial Statements is presented in Note 2 and the additional disclosures are
shown in Notes 9 and 23 .

ASU  2014-09  In  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  we  adopted  ASU  2014-09  ,  Revenue
from
Contracts
with
Customers
(Topic
606)
 ,  using  the  full
retrospective method. Topic 606 requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that
reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

Most of our defense contracts at our BDS and BGS segments and certain military derivative aircraft contracts at our BCA segment now recognize
revenue  under  the  new  standard  as  costs  are  incurred.  Under  previous  GAAP,  revenue  was  generally  recognized  when  deliveries  were  made,
performance  milestones  were  attained,  or  as  costs  were  incurred.  The  new  standard  accelerates  the  timing  of  when  the  revenue  is  recognized,
however, it does not change the total amount of revenue recognized on these contracts. The new standard does not affect revenue recognition or
the use of program accounting for commercial airplane contracts in our BCA business. We continue to recognize revenue for these contracts

54

Table of Contents

at  the  point  in  time  when  the  customer  accepts  delivery  of  the  airplane.  The  adoption  resulted  in  a  cumulative  adjustment  to  increase  Retained
earnings by $901 at January 1, 2016, an increase of $139 to Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016, and an increase of $261 to Net
earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017.

ASU 2017-07 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-07 , Compensation
-
Retirement
Benefits
(Topic
715):
Improving
the
Presentation
of
Net
Periodic
Pension
Cost
and
Net
Periodic
Postretirement
Benefit
Cost
 . The  standard  requires  non-service  cost  components  of  net  periodic
benefit cost to be presented in non-operating earnings using a retrospective transition method. We applied a practical expedient as the estimation
basis  for  the  reclassification  of  prior  period  non-service  cost  components  of  net  periodic  benefit  cost  from  Earnings  from  operations  to  Other
income/(loss), net. Through the end of 2017, a portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense was not recognized in
net  earnings  in  the  year  incurred  because  it  was  allocated  to  production  as  product  costs,  and  reflected  in  inventory  at  the  end  of  the  reporting
periods. Effective January 1, 2018, in accordance with our adoption of ASU 2017-07, only service costs may be allocated to production costs and
capitalized in inventory on a prospective basis. The impact of adoption was not material.

ASU 2016-18 In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18 , Statement
of
Cash
Flows
(Topic
230):
Restricted
Cash.
The standard requires
companies to include restricted amounts with Cash & cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period total amounts shown on
the Statements of Cash Flows. The impact of adoption was not material.

ASU  2018-02  In  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  we  early  adopted  ASU  2018-02  , Income
Statement—Reporting
Comprehensive
Income
(Topic
220):
Reclassification
of
Certain
Tax
Effects
from
Accumulated
Other
Comprehensive
Income.
 The  standard  allows  companies  to  reclassify  from
Accumulated other comprehensive income/loss to Retained earnings the difference between the historical corporate income tax rate of 35% and the
21%  rate  enacted  in  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (TCJA)  in  December  2017.  This  resulted  in  an  increase  of  $2,997 to Retained earnings  and an
increase of $2,997 to Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Revenue and Related Cost Recognition

Commercial  aircraft  contracts  The  majority  of  our  BCA segment  revenue  is  derived  from  commercial  aircraft  contracts.  For  each  contract,  we
determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft
performance  obligation  based  on  relative  standalone  selling  prices  adjusted  by  an  escalation  formula  as  specified  in  the  customer  agreement.
Revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the
customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.

Where an aircraft is still in our possession, and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer (known as a bill-and-hold arrangement), revenue will
be recognized when all specific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met.

Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit upon order and
additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances and
progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  are  normal  and  customary  for  commercial  aircraft  contracts  and  not  considered  a  significant  financing
component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.

Long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS , certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at BGS are long-
term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts
primarily include fighter

55

Table of Contents

jets,  rotorcraft,  cybersecurity  products,  surveillance  suites,  advanced  weapons,  missile  defense,  military  derivative  aircraft,  satellite  systems,  and
modification  of  commercial  passenger  aircraft  to  cargo  freighters.  Services  sales  under  long-term  contracts  primarily  include  support  and
maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.

For each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction
price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone
selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated
nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-
term  contracts  may  be  modified  over  their  life,  the  transaction  price  is  based  on  current  rights  and  obligations  under  the  contract  and  does  not
include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for
the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs
incurred  plus  an  agreed  upon  profit.  The  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  in
establishing  the  price  for  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  Certain  long-term  contracts  include  in  the  transaction  price  variable  consideration,
such  as incentive  and award  fees,  if specified  targets  are achieved.  The amount  included in the transaction  price represents  the expected  value,
based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.

Long-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as services
are  rendered.  We  generally  recognize  revenue  over  time  as  we  perform  on  long-term  contracts  because  of  continuous  transfer  of  control  to  the
customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the
customer  to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in
process.  Similarly,  for  non-U.S.  government  contracts,  the  customer  typically  controls  the  work  in  process  as  evidenced  either  by  contractual
termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not
have an alternative use to the Company.

The accounting  for long-term  contracts  involves a judgmental process of estimating  total  sales  , costs and profit for each performance obligation.
Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to
the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales.  Recognizing  revenue  as  costs  are  incurred  provides  an  objective  measure  of  progress  on  the  long-term
contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.

Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment
which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-
of-completion. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward
loss on the long-term contract is recognized.

Net  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  to  prior  years'  revenue  and  earnings,  including  certain  reach-forward  losses,  across  all  long-term  contracts
were as follows:

Increase to Revenue

Increase/(decrease) to Earnings from Operations

Increase/(decrease) to Diluted EPS

($0.29)

2017

Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2018 included reach-forward losses of $736 , $445 and $1,127 on the USAF
KC-46A Tanker contract recorded during 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances
may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.

Payments  under  long-term  contracts  may  be  received  before  or  after  revenue  is  recognized.  The  U.S.  government  customer  typically  withholds
payment  of  a  small  portion  of  the  contract  price  until  contract  completion.  Therefore,  long-term  contracts  typically  generate  Unbilled  receivables
(contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances and
progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company in
the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.

Commercial  spare  parts  contracts  Certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  include  sales  of  commercial  spare  parts.  For  each  contract,  we
determine the transaction  price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair
value.  We  generally  consider  each  spare  part  to  be  a  separate  performance  obligation.  Revenue  is  recognized  for  each  commercial  spare  part
performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare part
where  a  customer  may  receive  a  full  or  partial  refund,  a  credit  applied  to  amounts  owed,  a  different  product  in  exchange,  or  any  combination  of
these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at
average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.

Other service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance,
training, data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the services
are rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts the
transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.

Concession  Sharing  Arrangements  We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  and
services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessions
incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements,
which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.

Unbilled Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings

Unbilled  receivables  (contract  assets)  arise  when  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  for  amounts  which  cannot  yet  be  billed  under  terms  of  the
contract  with  the  customer.  Advances  and  progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  arise  when  the  Company  receives  payments  from  customers  in
advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract .

Financial  Services  Revenue  We  record  financial  services  revenue  associated  with  sales-type/finance  leases,  operating  leases,  and  notes
receivable.

Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance
leases, we record an asset at lease inception. This asset is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value
of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate
a level rate of return on the net investment. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive
at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates.

57

Table of Contents

Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.

For  operating  leases,  revenue  on  leased  aircraft  and  equipment  is  recorded  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  lease.  Operating  lease
assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated
residual  value,  using  the  straight-line  method.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  by
prospectively adjusting depreciation expense.

For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization
of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.

Reinsurance  Revenue  Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  The
member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $145 ,
$141 and $147 during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were
$136 , $144 and $139 during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  respectively.  Revenues  and  costs  are  presented  net  in  Cost  of  sales  in  the  Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Fleet Support

We  provide  assistance  and  support  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.
Collectively known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering
support, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and
technical  consulting  support.  This  activity  continues  throughout  the  aircraft’s  operational  life.  Services  provided  after  delivery  include  field  service
support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering
data,  and  the  issuance  of  service  bulletins  that  impact  the  entire  model’s  fleet.  Field  service  support  involves  our  personnel  located  at  customer
facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.

Research and Development

Research  and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design,  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  to
government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers.
Costs  that  are  incurred  pursuant  to  such  contractual  arrangements  are  recorded  over  the  period  that  revenue  is  recognized,  consistent  with  our
contract  accounting  policy.  We  have  certain  research  and  development  arrangements  that  meet  the  requirement  for  best  efforts  research  and
development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense
rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $234 , $288 and $311 in 2018 , 2017 and
2016 , respectively.

Share-Based Compensation

We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based
on  the  grant-date  fair  value  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  For  awards  settled  in  cash,  or  that  may  be  settled  in  cash,  we  measure  compensation
expense based on the fair value at each reporting  date  net of estimated  forfeitures.  The expense is recognized over the requisite  service period,
which is generally the vesting period of the award.

58

Table of Contents

Income Taxes

Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Earnings before income taxes based on current
tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred
tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are
recognized in different  time periods for financial reporting  purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining
income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.

The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  We  record  a  liability  for  the  difference  between  the  benefit  recognized  and  measured  for
financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax
positions  changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  are
classified as a component of Income tax expense.

Postretirement Plans

The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. We also provide
postretirement  benefit  plans  other  than  pensions,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  to  eligible  retirees  and  qualifying  dependents.
Benefits  under  the  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  are  generally  based  on  age  at  retirement  and  years  of  service  and,  for  some
pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is
determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-
term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). A portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension and
other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs,
and  reflected  in  inventory  at  the  end  of  a  reporting  period.  Actuarial  gains  and  losses,  which  occur  when  actual  experience  differs  from  actuarial
assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or
plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is
reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Postemployment Plans

We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,
and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.

Environmental Remediation

We  are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  and
remediation  of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,
obligations,  and  commitments  for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recoveries  from  other
responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental
remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is
based  on  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  exposure  for  investigation,  cleanup,  and  monitoring  costs  to  be
incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be
able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for
recovery is deemed probable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  highly  liquid  instruments,  such  as  commercial  paper,  time  deposits,  and  other  money  market  instruments,
which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and
reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable
were $127 and $116 at December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

Inventories

Inventoried  costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-
recurring  costs,  and  applicable  overhead,  which  includes  fringe  benefits,  production  related  indirect  and  plant  management  salaries  and  plant
services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed
costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs
include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one
year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.

Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs
incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs
are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor
and  other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  these
deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is
below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from
suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process.

The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete
all  contract  requirements.  When  actual  contract  costs  and  the  estimate  to  complete  exceed  total  estimated  contract  revenues,  a  loss  provision  is
recorded.  The  determination  of  net  realizable  value  of  commercial  aircraft  program  costs  is  based  upon  quarterly  program  reviews  that  estimate
revenue  and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  program
revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.

60

Table of Contents

Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.
See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost
or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess
or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired
inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.

Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that
are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the
aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the
ability  to  recover  amounts  paid.  However,  to  the  extent  early  issue  sales  consideration  exceeds  advances  and  is  not  considered  to  be  otherwise
recoverable, it would be written off in the current period.

Precontract Costs

We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery
from  future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalized
precontract  costs  are  included  in  Inventories  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Should  future  orders  not
materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  are
depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and
equipment, from 4  to  20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance;
and  machinery  and  equipment,  sum-of-the-years’  digits.  Capitalized  internal  use  software  is  included  in  Other  assets  and  amortized  using  the
straight line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over the
term of the hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than 5 years. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable
lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Long-lived  assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  an
impairment  assessment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  If  the  carrying
value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between
the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,
asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.

We  also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  be
performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.
Accordingly, these

61

Table of Contents

obligations  have  not  been  recorded  in the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  A  liability  for  these  obligations  will be recorded  in the  period  when
sufficient  information  regarding  timing  and  method  of  settlement  becomes  available  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  liability’s  fair  value.  In
addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we
have  not  become  aware  of  it  through  the  normal  course  of  business),  and  therefore,  these  obligations  also  have  not  been  included  in  the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles

Goodwill  and  other  acquired  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  lives  are  not  amortized,  but  are  tested  for  impairment  annually  and  when  an  event
occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.

We  test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  two-step  impairment  process.  If  we  choose  to  perform  a
qualitative assessment  and determine  it is more  likely than not that the  carrying  value of the net assets is more  than the fair  value of the related
operations,  the  two-step  impairment  process  is  then  performed;  otherwise,  no  further  testing  is  required.  For  operations  where  the  two-step
impairment  process  is  used,  we  first  compare  the  carrying  value  of  net  assets  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related  operations.  If  the  fair  value  is
determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for
goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below
carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.

Indefinite-lived  intangibles  consist  of  brand  and  trade  names  acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  these  intangibles  for  impairment  by
comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value
over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.

Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,
from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from
2 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of
the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Investments

Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.

Available-for-sale  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  U.S.  government  agency  securities,  and  corporate  debt  securities.  Available-for-sale
debt  securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded,  net  of  tax,  as  a  component  of  accumulated  other
comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method.
Available-for-sale debt securities are assessed for impairment quarterly.

The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,
over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between
20% and 50% . The cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.

62

Table of Contents

Other  Equity  investments  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recorded  through  net  earnings.  Equity  investments  without  readily
determinable  fair  value  are  measured  at  cost,  less  impairments,  plus  or  minus  observable  price  changes.  Equity  investments  without  readily
determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.

We  classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-
operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including
our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on
the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-
strategic  purposes.  Earnings  from  non-operating  investments,  including  interest  and  dividends  on  marketable  securities,  and  any  impairments  or
gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net.

Derivatives

All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.
We use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. For derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in
fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the
period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to
include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For our cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period
or  periods  during  which  the  hedged  forecasted  transaction  affects  earnings.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  of  a  cash  flow  hedge  is
reported  in  earnings  immediately.  We  have  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  and
international  business  requirements.  These  agreements  are  derivatives  for  accounting  purposes  but  are  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting
treatment.  We  also  hold  certain  derivative  instruments  for  economic  purposes  that  are  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment.  For  these
aluminum  agreements  and  for  other  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment,  the  changes  in  their  fair  value  are
recorded in earnings immediately.

Aircraft Valuation

Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for
the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used
aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain
customers  wherein  we  agree  to  repurchase  the  Sale  Aircraft  at  a  specified  price,  generally 10 to 15 years after  delivery  of  the  Sale  Aircraft.  Our
repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an
agreement  for  the  sale  of  additional  new  aircraft,  and  if  the  customer  exercises  its  right  to  sell  the  Sale  Aircraft  to  us,  a  contingent  repurchase
commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-
in commitments.

63

Table of Contents

Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:

(1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the
fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or

(2) charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitive
agreement  for  Sale  Aircraft  but  prior  to  the  purchase  of  the  used  trade-in  aircraft.  Estimates  based  on  current  aircraft  values  would  be
included in Accrued liabilities.

The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft
and  similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  most
instances begins years before the return  of the aircraft.  There are several possible markets  in which we continually pursue opportunities to place
used  aircraft.  These  markets  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  resale  market,  which  could  potentially  include  the  cost  of  long-term  storage;  the
leasing  market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraft
valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation
analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party  aircraft valuations
based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.

Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent
to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets
are included in Customer financing.

Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance
leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary.

We  assess  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  we  own,  including  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateral
underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair
values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance
for losses on receivables.

We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the
aircraft  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  aircraft.  Under  certain  circumstances,  we  apply  judgment  based  on  the  attributes  of  the  specific  aircraft  or
equipment,  usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outside
publications.

Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or
assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be
less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how
long  we  will  hold  an  asset  subject  to  operating  lease  before  it  is  sold,  the  expected  future  lease  rates,  lease  terms,  residual  value  of  the  asset,
periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life
of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

64

Table of Contents

When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over
the fair value of the asset.

Allowance  for  losses  on  customer  financing  receivables  We  record  the  potential  impairment  of customer  financing  receivables  in a valuation
account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two
components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.

We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due
according  to  the  original  contractual  terms  of  the  receivable  agreement,  without  regard  to  any  subsequent  restructurings.  Factors  considered  in
assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We
determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the
related collateral we would expect to realize.

We  review  the  adequacy  of  the  allowance  attributable  to  the  remaining  receivables  (after  excluding  receivables  subject  to  a  specific  impairment
allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the
excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the
carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer
credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each
customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers.

We have entered  into agreements  with certain  customers  that  would entitle  us to look beyond the specific  collateral underlying  the receivable  for
purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting
from  a  default  condition  be  insufficient  to  cover  the  carrying  value  of  our  receivable  (creating  a  shortfall  condition),  these  agreements  would,  for
example,  permit  us  to  take  the  actions  necessary  to  sell  or  retain  certain  other  assets  in  which  the  customer  has  an  equity  interest  and  use  the
proceeds to cover the shortfall.

Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft
value  publications  as  a  basis  to  validate  the  reasonableness  of  the  allowance  for  losses  on  receivables.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  actual
results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance
for losses on receivables.

Warranties

In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4 -
year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under
our  authorization.  These  warranties  are  included  in  the  programs’  estimate  at  completion.  On  occasion  we  have  made  commitments  beyond  the
standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties
issued  by  our  BDS  segment  principally  relate  to  sales  of  military  aircraft  and  weapons  hardware  and  are  included  in  the  contract  cost  estimates.
These  sales  are  generally  accompanied  by  a  six  month  to  two  -year  warranty  period  and  cover  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and
software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which
the related product delivery occurs. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty
coverage outstanding for products delivered

65

Table of Contents

times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal
claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.

We  provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraft
performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known
and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,
and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of
the  related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  supplied
equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a
reduction  in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  the
programs’ estimate at completion.

Supplier Penalties

We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is
reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.

Guarantees

We record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. For credit guarantees,
the  liability  is  equal  to  the  present  value  of  the  expected  loss.  We  determine  the  expected  loss  by  multiplying  the  creditor’s  default  rate  by  the
guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. If at inception of a
guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a) the fair value of the guarantee
as described above or (b) the probable contingent loss amount.

Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016 - 02, Leases
(Topic
842)
. The new
standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to
report most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard permits
two  approaches,  one  requiring  retrospective  application  of  the  new  guidance  with  restatement  of  prior  years,  and  one  requiring  prospective
application of the new guidance. We plan to adopt the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019 and apply it prospectively. We do not expect
the new lease standard to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 3 – Acquisitions and Joint Ventures

KLX Inc.

On  October  9,  2018,  we  acquired  all  the  outstanding  shares  of  KLX  Inc.  (KLX).  KLX  is  a  global  provider  of  aviation  parts  and  services  in  the
aerospace  industry.  Its  capabilities  include  distribution  and  supply  chain  services.  The  KLX  acquisition  is  intended  to  accelerate  growth  in  our
services  business  by  allowing  Boeing  to  offer  commercial,  defense,  business  and  general  aviation  customers  a  broader  range  of  offerings.  The
results  of  KLX’s  operations  have  been  included  in  our  Global  Services  segment  from  the  acquisition  date.  KLX’s  revenues  and  earnings  from
operations from October 9, 2018 through December 31, 2018 were $356 and $50 .

The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents

Accounts receivable

Inventories

Other current assets

Property, plant & equipment

Goodwill

Intangible assets

Other assets

Current liabilities

Other long-term liabilities

Long-term debt

(1,210)

$3,286

The goodwill has been allocated to the Global Services and Commercial Airplanes segments based on revenue synergies expected to be realized
from the integration of KLX’s products and services and expected cost synergies primarily resulting from the consolidation of procurement spending
and functional support. Approximately $533 of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets is deductible for tax purposes. The acquired intangible
assets primarily relate to customer and supplier relationships and have a weighted-average useful life of 17.5 years .

Strategic Partnership with Embraer

On July 5, 2018, we and Embraer S.A. (Embraer) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a strategic partnership
between  the  two  companies.  On  December  17,  2018,  the  terms  of  the  strategic  partnership  were  agreed  by  both  companies.  The  agreed  terms
define  the  joint  venture  comprising  the  commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  in  which  Boeing  will  acquire  an  80  percent
ownership stake for $4.2 billion . The companies have also agreed to the terms of another joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the
multi-mission  medium  airlift  KC-390,  in  which  Boeing  will  hold  a  49  percent  ownership  stake.  On  January  10,  2019,  the  Government  of  Brazil
reviewed  the  terms  of  the  strategic  partnership  and  advised  it  would  not  exercise  its  Golden  Share  veto  power,  allowing  the  transaction  to  move
forward. On January 11, 2019, the Embraer Board of Directors ratified its prior approval of the strategic partnership and authorized execution of the
definitive  transaction  documents.  On  January  24,  2019,  the  definitive  transaction  documents  were  executed.  The  transaction  remains  subject  to
Embraer shareholder and regulatory approvals, as well as other customary closing conditions. Assuming approvals are received in a timely manner,
the transaction is intended to close by

the end of 2019 . If the transaction is not completed due to failure to obtain antitrust approvals, we would be required to pay a termination fee of
$100 .

Note 5 – Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings
per  share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participating
securities as if all earnings had been distributed  during the period. Participating  securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed
earnings.

Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weighted
average common shares outstanding.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities,  divided by the diluted weighted
average common shares outstanding.

The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:

(1)   On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)  was enacted. The TCJA revised the U.S. corporate  income tax by, among other
things,  lowering  the  rate  from  35% to 21% effective  January  1,  2018,  implementing  a  territorial  tax  system  and  imposing  a  one-time  tax  on
deemed  repatriated  earnings  of  non-U.S.  subsidiaries.  The  TCJA  also  enacted  provisions  which  effectively  apply  a  lower  U.S.  tax  rate  to
intangible income derived from serving non-U.S. markets. In 2018, we recorded a $549 tax benefit related to foreign derived intangible income.
In the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $412 related to the settlement of the 2013-2014

federal tax audit. In the third quarter of 2016, a tax benefit of $177 was recorded related to the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $181 , $207 and $105 .
In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), in the fourth quarter of 2017, we
recorded provisional tax benefits of $1,430 related  to  the  remeasurement  of  our  net  U.S.  deferred  tax  liabilities  to  reflect  the  reduction  in  the
corporate tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $159 related to tax on non-U.S. activities resulting from the TCJA. During the fourth quarter
of 2018 and in accordance with SAB 118, the Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017
and recorded an incremental benefit related to refinements to these provisional amounts which was not significant.
In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded incremental tax benefits of $440 related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision
which held that the tax basis in certain assets could be increased (tax basis adjustment).

Significant components of our deferred tax (liabilities)/assets at December 31 were as follows:

Inventory and long-term contract methods of income recognition

Pension benefits

Fixed assets, intangibles and goodwill (net of valuation allowance of $16 and $16)

Retiree health care benefits

Other employee benefits

Accrued expenses and reserves

Customer and commercial financing

The deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.

In  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP,  the  Company  has  made  an  accounting  policy  election  to  treat  Global  Intangible  Low  Tax  Income  (GILTI)  as  a
current year tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.

75

Table of Contents

Therefore,  we  have  not  provided  any  deferred  tax  impacts  of  GILTI  in  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  the  year  ended  December  31,
2018.

The TCJA one-time repatriation tax and GILTI liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We
have not provided for foreign withholding tax on the undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to
be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were to be distributed, any foreign withholding tax would not be significant.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated
Statements  of  Financial  Position  were  not  significant.  The  amounts  of  interest  included  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  were  not
significant for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 .

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

As of December 31 , 2018, 2017 and 2016 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $2,412 , $1,736 and $1,557 , respectively, of which
$1,405 , $1,568 and $1,402 would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of December 31, 2018 , these amounts are primarily associated with
uncertainties in the TCJA and the amount of research tax credits claimed. Also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues
such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed.

Federal  income  tax  audits  have  been  settled  for  all  years  prior  to  2015.  The  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  is  expected  to  begin the  2015-2017
federal tax audit in the first quarter of 2019. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2017 tax
years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.

Audit  outcomes  and  the  timing  of  audit  settlements  are  subject  to  significant  uncertainty.  It  is  reasonably  possible  that  within  the  next  12  months
unrecognized tax benefits related to state matters under audit may decrease by up to $460 based on current estimates.

Note 9 – Contracts with Customers

Unbilled receivables increased from $8,194 at December 31, 2017 to $10,025 at December 31, 2018 , primarily  driven by revenue recognized at
BDS, BGS and BCA in excess of billings.

Advances and progress billings increased from $48,042 at December 31, 2017 to $50,676 at December 31, 2018 , primarily driven by advances on
orders received in excess of revenue recognized at BCA .

Revenues recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 from amounts recorded as Advances and progress billings at the beginning
of each year were $24,737 and $22,796 .

We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due
according  to  the  original  contractual  terms.  At  December  31,  2018  and  2017  ,  we  individually  evaluated  for  impairment  customer  financing
receivables of $409 and $422 , of which $398 and $411 were determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired
receivables as the collateral values exceeded the carrying values of the receivables.

Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. Income
is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer . The average recorded
investment in impaired financing receivables for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $403 , and the related interest income was insignificant.

The  change  in  the  allowance  for  losses  on  financing  receivables  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2018,  2017  and  2016  ,  consisted  of  the

The adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer
financing  receivables  are  customer  credit  ratings,  default  rates  and  collateral  values.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  and
determine the creditworthiness  of each customer  based upon publicly available information  and information obtained directly from our customers.
Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies.

At December 31, 2018 , our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged 22.8% , 6.5%
and 0.7% , respectively, to the exposure associated with those receivables.

Customer Financing Exposure

Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and
overall  market  conditions  and  may  be  subject  to  reduced  valuation  with  market  decline.  Declines  in  collateral  values  could  result  in  asset
impairments, reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8
and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.

The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at December 31:

717 Aircraft ($204 and $269 accounted for as operating leases)

747-8 Aircraft ($132 and $138 accounted for as operating leases)

737 Aircraft ($263 and $127 Accounted for as operating leases)

MD-80 Aircraft (Accounted for as sales-type finance leases)

757 Aircraft ($24 and $27 accounted for as operating leases)

747-400 Aircraft ($45 and $88 Accounted for as operating leases)

777 Aircraft ($60 and $0 accounted for as operating leases)

As  part  of  selected  lease  transactions,  Boeing  may  provide  incentives  to  commercial  customers.  At  December  31,  2018  Customer  Financing
included $250 of  lease  incentives  with  one  customer  that  is  currently  experiencing  liquidity  issues  and  is  seeking  additional  capital.  Should  the
customer fail to address its liquidity issues the lease incentive asset could become impaired, and we could incur charges of up to $250 .

Note 13 – Other Assets

Sea Launch

At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , Other assets included $244 and $356 of receivables related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venture
which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launch’s bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The net amounts owed to Boeing by
each  of  the  partners  are  as  follows:  S.P.  Koroley  Rocket  and  Space  Corporation  Energia  of  Russia  (RSC  Energia)  –  $111  ,  PO  Yuzhnoye
Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine – $89 and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine – $44 .

In 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch
partners.  In  2016,  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Central  District  of  California  issued  a  judgment  in  favor  of  Boeing.  Later  that  year,  we
reached  an  agreement  which  we  believe  will  enable  us  to  recover  the  outstanding  receivable  balance  from  RSC  Energia  over  the  next  several
years. We continue to pursue collection efforts against the former Ukrainian partners in connection with the court judgment. We continue to believe
the  partners  have  the  financial  wherewithal  to  pay  and  intend  to  pursue  vigorously  all  of  our  rights  and  remedies.  In  the  event  we  are  unable  to
secure reimbursement from RSC Energia and the Ukrainian Sea Launch partners, we could incur additional charges.

incurred  related  to  pension  and  retiree  medical  obligations  of  former  Boeing  employees  who  were  subsequently  employed  by  Spirit.  On  July  12,
2018,  the  Delaware  Supreme  Court  denied  Boeing’s  claim  for  indemnification.  As  a  result,  in  the  second  quarter  we  wrote  off  the  receivables
attributable to the Spirit indemnifications.

The  liabilities  recorded  represent  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  costs  expected  to  be  incurred  to  remediate
sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these
recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the
discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that
includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our
experience  and  existing  laws  and  regulations.  There  are  some  potential  remediation  obligations  where  the  costs  of  remediation  cannot  be
reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded
our recorded liabilities by $796 and $868 .

In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain
customers  that  give  them  the  right  to  trade  in  used  aircraft  at  a  specified  price  upon  the  purchase  of  Sale  Aircraft.  The  probability  that  trade-in
commitments  will  be exercised  is determined  by  using  both  quantitative  information  from  valuation  sources  and qualitative  information  from  other
sources.  The  probability  of  exercise  is  assessed  quarterly,  or  as  events  trigger  a  change,  and  takes  into  consideration  the  current  economic  and
airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during
the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.

Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2018 have expiration dates from 2019 through 2026 . At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , total
contractual trade-in commitments were $1,519 and $1,462 . As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we estimated that it was probable we would be
obligated  to  perform  on  certain  of  these  commitments  with  net  amounts  payable  to  customers  totaling  $522 and $155 and  the  fair  value  of  the
related trade-in aircraft was $485 and $155 .

Financing Commitments

Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft,
totaled $19,462 and $10,221 as  of  December  31,  2018  and  2017  .  The  estimated  earliest  potential  funding  dates  for  these  commitments  as  of

have  concluded  that  no  reserve  for  future  potential  losses  is  required  for  these  financing  commitments  based  upon  the  terms,  such  as
collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided.

Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds

We  have  entered  into  standby  letters  of  credit  and  surety  bonds  with  financial  institutions  primarily  relating  to  the  guarantee  of  our  future
performance  on  certain  contracts.  Contingent  liabilities  on  outstanding  letters  of  credit  agreements  and  surety  bonds  aggregated  approximately
$3,761 and $3,708 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

Company Owned Life Insurance

McDonnell Douglas Corporation  insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance  (COLI),  which are life insurance policies with a cash
surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this
time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the
cash  surrender  value  was  $466 and $489 and  the  total  loans  were  $447 and $470 .  As  we  have  the  right  to  offset  the  loans  against  the  cash
surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31,
2018 and 2017 .

The Bipartisan  Budget Act  of  2018, passed in  February  2018, raised  the  2011  Budget Control  Act  spending caps for  fiscal  years  2018 and 2019
(FY18  and  FY19).  The  consolidated  spending  bills  signed  into  law  in  September  2018  provide  defense  funding  for  FY19,  in  compliance  with  the
revised caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agencies
not  covered  by  enacted  FY19  appropriations,  including  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  and  Federal  Aviation
Administration  (FAA),  remains  uncertain.  The  unfunded  departments  and  agencies  affected  by  the  partial  government  shutdown  (December  22,
2018  through  January  25,  2019)  are  now  covered  by  a  Continuing  Resolution  that  extends  funding  at  FY18  levels  through  February  15,
2019.  Congress  and  the  President  must  agree  to  FY19  appropriations  or  an  additional  Continuing  Resolution  to  fund  affected  departments  and
agencies beyond the February 15 deadline in order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdown
to the Company’s operations would increase as the shutdown continues.

There continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level  appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including
NASA. The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20
and FY21). The lower budget caps will take effect again in FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend
the law. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes
could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the
results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.

BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts

Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the
work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, T-X Trainer, VC-
25B  Presidential  Aircraft,  MQ-25  Stingray,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  The  operational  and  technical  complexities  of  these  contracts
create  financial  risk,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  order  cancellations  or  other  financially  significant  exposure.  Changes  to  cost  and
revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, we have recorded reach-forward losses
on the KC-46A Tanker in 2018 as well as in prior years, and we continue to have risk for further losses if we experience further production, technical
or quality issues, and delays in flight testing, certification and/or

delivery. In addition, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 associated
with  options  for  346  T-X  Trainer  aircraft  and  a  loss  of  $291 related  to  the  MQ-25  Stingray  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and  Development  (EMD)
contract.  Moreover,  our  fixed-price  development  programs  remain  subject  to  additional  reach-forward  losses  if  we  experience  further  technical  or
quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs.

KC-46A Tanker

In  2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next  generation  aerial
refueling tankers. This EMD contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems
integration. In 2016, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion and in 2017, the USAF authorized an additional
LRIP  lot  for  15  aircraft  valued  at  $2.1 billion .  On  September  10,  2018,  the  USAF  authorized  an  additional  LRIP  lot  for  18  aircraft  valued  at  $2.9
billion . In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the USAF .

At December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $370 of capitalized precontract costs and $550 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers.

Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts

Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands
related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve
for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily  resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide
refunds to the U.S. government.

Note 15 – Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees.

The  following  table  provides  quantitative  data  regarding  our  third  party  guarantees.  The  maximum  potential  payments  represent  a  “worst-case
scenario,” and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated
values  of  assets  we  could  liquidate  or  receive  from  other  parties  to  offset  our  payments  under  guarantees.  The  carrying  amount  of  liabilities
represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities.

proceeds  from  collateral/recourse  in  the  table  above  represent  the  lower  of  the  contracted  repurchase  price  or  the  expected  fair  value  of  each
aircraft at the specified repurchase date.

Indemnifications  to  ULA  In  2006,  we  agreed  to  indemnify  ULA  through  December  31,  2020  against  potential  non-recoverability  and  non-
allowability  of  $1,360 of  Boeing  Delta  launch  program  inventory  included  in  contributed  assets  plus  $1,860 of  inventory  subject  to  an  inventory
supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021 . See Note 8 . ULA has yet to consume $52 of contributed inventory.

We  also  agreed  to  indemnify  ULA  for  up  to  $261 in  the  event  ULA  was  unable  to  obtain  sufficient  additional  contract  pricing  from  the  USAF  for
certain satellite missions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, ULA and the USAF entered into a settlement agreement which resulted in the USAF making
a payment of $240 to ULA.

Potential  payments  for  Other  Delta  contracts  include  $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred production costs. In June
2011,  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency  (DCMA)  notified  ULA  that  it  had  determined  that  $271  of  deferred  support  costs  are  not
recoverable  under  government  contracts.  In  December  2011,  the  DCMA  notified  ULA  of  the  potential  non-recoverability  of  an  additional  $114 of
deferred production costs. ULA and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF
for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying ULA’s certified claim in May 2012. In 2012, Boeing
and ULA, through its subsidiary United Launch Services, filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and
production costs from the U.S. government, which subsequently asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support
cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. government’s counterclaim is without merit. The discovery phase of the litigation completed in 2017. Boeing
filed a motion on November 17, 2017, asking the court to award full recovery without a trial. The court denied Boeing’s motion on August 29, 2018.
The court has entered the parties’ proposed pre-trial schedule providing for a final pre-trial conference on or before October 17, 2019. If, contrary to
our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax
losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the DCMA.

Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our
BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating
to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted
under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments
under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are
probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 14 .

Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original
lessee  or  debtor  does  not  make  payments  or  perform  certain  specified  services.  Generally,  these  guarantees  have  been  extended  on  behalf  of
guaranteed  parties  with  less  than  investment-grade  credit  and  are  collateralized  by  certain  assets.  Current  outstanding  credit  guarantees  expire
through 2036 .

Industrial Revenue Bonds

Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at
our St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County.
We  record  these  properties  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  We  have  also  purchased  the  IRBs  and  therefore  are  the
bondholders  as  well  as  the  borrower/lessee  of  the  properties  purchased  with  the  IRB  proceeds.  The  liabilities  and  IRB  assets  are  equal  and  are
reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $271 and $166 .

Note 16 – Debt

On February 23, 2018 , we issued $1,400 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $350 due March 1, 2023 that bear an annual interest rate of 2.8% ,
$350 due March 1, 2028 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.25% , $350 due March 1, 2038 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.55% , and $350
due March 1, 2048 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.625% . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment
with  our  existing  and  future  unsecured  and  unsubordinated  indebtedness.  The  net  proceeds  of  the  issuance  totaled  $1,338  ,  after  deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

On October  31,  2018  ,  we  issued  $700 of  fixed  rate  senior  notes  consisting  of  $350 due November  1,  2028  that  bear  an  annual  interest  rate  of
3.45% , and $350 due November 1, 2048 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.85% . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally
in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled $663 , after
deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $624 , $541 and $535 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company
interest payments were $616 , $527 and $523 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

We have $5,120 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,610 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in October, 2019 and
$2,510  expires  in  October,  2023  .  The  364-day  credit  facility  has  a  one-year  term  out  option  which  allows  us  to  extend  the  maturity  of  any
borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt or
credit facility agreements.

The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union
employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.

We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants, and are structured
to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future
benefit payments.

We  also  have  other  postretirement  benefits  (OPB)  other  than  pensions  which  consist  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  and
qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for
approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by most United
Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage.

Table of Contents

The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). We
have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health
care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds
the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities.

The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality
bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields
developed  from  bonds  at  various  maturity  points.  Bonds  with  the  ten  percent  highest  and  the  ten  percent  lowest  yields  are  omitted.  The  present
value of each plan’s benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.

The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and
anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns,
the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the
upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA).
Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five -year moving average of plan
assets. As of December 31, 2018 , the MRVA was approximately $3,435 more than the fair market value of assets.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension
plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for
our  long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  total
investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class
are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.

We periodically  update our long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations.  We use various  analytics  to determine  the optimal  asset  mix  and consider  plan
liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment
benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.
Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length
of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and
exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and
rebalanced periodically. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:

Fixed  income  securities  are  invested  primarily  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  long  duration  instruments.  Global  equity  securities  are  invested  in  a
diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations.

Real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (LP) or other fund
structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate). Real estate includes, but is
not  limited  to,  investments  in  office,  retail,  apartment  and  industrial  properties.  Real  assets  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  investments  in  natural
resources  (such  as  energy,  farmland  and  timber),  commodities  and  infrastructure.  Private  equity  investment  vehicles  are  primarily  limited
partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies.

Hedge  fund  investments  seek  to  capitalize  on  inefficiencies  identified  across  and  within  different  asset  classes  or  markets.  Hedge  fund  strategy
types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy.

Investment  managers  are  retained  for  explicit  investment  roles  specified  by  contractual  investment  guidelines.  Certain  investment  managers  are
authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the
desired  market  exposure  of  a  security  or  an  index,  transfer  value-added  performance  between  asset  classes,  achieve  the  desired  currency
exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.

As  a  percentage  of  total  pension  plan  assets,  derivative  net  notional  amounts  were  4.4% and 5.0% for  fixed  income,  including  to-be-announced
mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 5.5% and 6.9% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

In 2017, the Company contributed $3,500 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage and liquidate
the stock over time at its discretion. The liquidation of the common stock holdings was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Risk  Management  In  managing  the  plan  assets,  we  review  and  manage  risk  associated  with  funded  status  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  market  risk,
counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach
and  are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  by
investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored
regularly  through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counter
derivatives.  Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuation
processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing .

Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The fair
value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on
quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets.  Level  2  refers  to  fair  values  estimated  using  significant  other  observable  inputs,  and  Level  3
includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Table of Contents

Fixed  income  securities  are  primarily  valued  upon  a  market  approach,  using  matrix  pricing  and  considering  a  security’s  relationship  to  other
securities  for which quoted prices in an active market  may be available, or an income approach, converting  future  cash flows to a single present
value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.

Common/collective/pooled  funds  are  typically  common  or  collective  trusts  valued  at their  NAVs that  are  calculated  by  the investment  manager  or
sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using
an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates.
Exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected
in the payables and receivables portion of the table.

Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled
fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily
using  a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  for
instruments  with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equity
securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.

Private  equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,
operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis
(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.

Real  estate  and  real  asset  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,  discounted
future  cash  flows,  independent  appraisals  and  market  based  comparable  data.  For  those  investments  reported  on  a  one-quarter  lagged  basis
(primarily  LPs)  NAVs  are  adjusted  for  subsequent  cash  flows  and  significant  events.  Publicly  traded  REITs  and  infrastructure  stocks  are  valued
using a market  approach based on quoted market  prices of identical instruments.  Exchange-traded  commodities  futures  positions are reported  in
accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.

Hedge  fund  NAVs  are  generally  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments.  This  is  primarily  done  by  applying  a  market  or  income
valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held.

Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner
(GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and
are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as
the practical expedient for the valuations.

and 2017 were a loss of $4 and a gain of $6 .

OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and
40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The
expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost.

Cash Flows

Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ), as well as rules governing funding of
our non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2019 . We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2019 .

Estimated  Future  Benefit  Payments The  table  below  reflects  the  total  pension  benefits  expected  to  be  paid  from  the  plans  or  from  our  assets,
including  both  our  share  of  the  benefit  cost  and  the  participants’  share  of  the  cost,  which  is  funded  by  participant  contributions.  OPB  payments

Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors
and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required
by ERISA ,  and  then  any  surplus  will  be  used  to  fund  a  trust  to  continue  present  and  future  payments  under  the  postretirement  medical  and  life
insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs.

Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will be
entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.

Defined Contribution Plans

We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense
for these defined contribution plans was $1,480 , $1,522 and $1,413 in 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

Note 18 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements

Share-Based Compensation

Our  2003 Incentive  Stock  Plan, as  amended  and restated,  permits  awards  of incentive  and non-qualified  stock  options,  stock  appreciation  rights,
restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to
our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance
under the plan is 87,000,000 .

Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent
there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy
these issuances during 2019 .

98

Share-based plans expense is primarily included in General and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our
executives. The share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows:

We discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units. Options granted through January 2014 had
an  exercise  price  equal  to  the  fair  market  value  of  our  stock  on  the  date  of  grant  and  expire  ten years  after  the date of grant.  The stock  options
vested over a period of three years and were fully vested at December 31, 2018 .

of stock options vested during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $27 .

Restricted Stock Units

In February  2018, 2017 and 2016 , we granted to our executives 260,730 , 523,835 and 777,837 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-
term incentive program with grant date fair values of $361.13 , $178.72 and $117.50 per unit, respectively. The RSUs granted under this program
will  vest  and  settle  in  common  stock  (on  a  one-for-one  basis)  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date.  If  an  executive  terminates  employment
because  of  retirement,  involuntary  layoff,  disability,  or  death,  the  employee  (or  beneficiary)  will  receive  a  proration  of  stock  units  based  on  active
employment during the three-year service period. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. In addition
to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward
various achievements. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below. The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the
high and low stock prices on the date of grant.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s total shareholder return as compared to
a group of peer companies over a three-year period. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial PBRSU grant. PBRSUs granted in
February 2017 and 2016 will not exceed 400% of the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). The PBRSUs granted under this program
will  vest  at  the  payout  amount  and  settle  in  common  stock  (on  a  one-for-one  basis)  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date.  If  an  executive
terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award
and,  if  the  award  is  earned,  will  receive  a  proration  of  stock  units  based  on  active  employment  during  the  three-year  service  period.  In  all  other
cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.

In  February    2018,  2017  and  2016  ,  we  granted  to  our  executives  241,284 , 492,273 and 721,176 PBRSUs  as  part  of  our  long-term  incentive
program.  Compensation  expense  for  the  award  is  recognized  over  the  three-year  performance  period  based  upon  the  grant  date  fair  value.  The
grant  date  fair  values  were  estimated  using  a  Monte-Carlo  simulation  model  with  the  assumptions  presented  below.  The  model  includes  no
expected dividend yield as the units earn dividend equivalents.

Other Compensation Arrangements

Performance Awards

Performance Awards are cash units that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. Each unit
has an initial value of $100 dollars. The amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars
per unit, depending on the Company’s performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay
these  awards  in  cash,  stock,  or  a  combination  of  both  after  the  three-year  performance  period.  Compensation  expense,  based  on  the  estimated
performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016 , we granted Performance Awards to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program with the payout based
on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant date. The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum
amount we could be required to pay out for the 2018, 2017 and 2016 Performance Awards is $369 , $332 and $310 , respectively. The 2016 grant is
expected to be paid out in cash in March 2019 .

Deferred Compensation

The Company has deferred compensation plans which permit employees to defer a portion of their salary, bonus, certain other incentive awards,
and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these amounts among 22 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account.

Total expense related to deferred compensation was $19 , $240 and $46 in 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017
, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,572 and $1,547 .

Note 19 – Shareholders’ Equity

On  December  17,  2018  ,  the  Board  approved  a  new  repurchase  plan  for  up  to  $20,000  of  common  stock,  replacing  the  previously  authorized
program. The program will expire when we have used all authorized funds or is otherwise terminated.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No
preferred stock has been issued.

Cash Flow Hedges

Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to
manage  currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreign  currencies.  Our  foreign
currency  contracts  hedge  forecasted  transactions  through  2024 .  We  use  commodity  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-price  purchase  commitments  to
hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through
2021 .

Fair Value Hedges

Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in
fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense.

Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment

We  have  entered  into  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  and  non-U.S.  business
requirements.  These agreements  are derivative  instruments  for  accounting purposes.  The quantities  of aluminum  in these  agreements  offset  and
are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

We  have derivative  instruments  with  credit-risk-related  contingent features.  For  foreign  exchange contracts  with  original maturities  of  at  least  five
years,  our  derivative  counterparties  could  require  settlement  if  we  default  on  our  five-year  credit  facility.  For  certain  commodity  contracts,  our
counterparties  could  require  collateral  posted  in  an  amount  determined  by  our  credit  ratings.  The  fair  value  of  foreign  exchange  and  commodity
contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2018 was $35 . At December 31, 2018 ,
there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.

Note 21 – Fair Value Measurements

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and
Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured
at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

Money  market  funds,  available-for-sale  debt  investments  and  equity  securities  are  valued  using  a  market  approach  based  on  the  quoted  market
prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments.

Derivatives  include  foreign  currency,  commodity  and  interest  rate  contracts.  Our  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  valued  using  an  income
approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued
using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The
fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.

Certain  assets  have  been  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  using  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3).  The  following  table

Investments,  Acquired  intangible  assets  and  Property,  plant  and  equipment  were  primarily  valued  using  an  income  approach  based  on  the
discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a
median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications
are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued
appropriateness  and  consistency  with  market  trends.  Under  certain  circumstances,  we  adjust  values  based  on  the  attributes  and  condition  of  the
specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by
third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft.

For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2018 , the following table presents
the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets.

The fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms
to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current
market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing
cost  derived  from  dealer  quotes  or  discounted  cash  flows.  The  fair  values  of  our  debt  classified  as  Level  3  are  based  on  discounted  cash  flow
models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to
estimate  the  fair  value  of  our  indemnifications  and  financing  commitments  because  the  amount  and  timing  of  those  arrangements  are  uncertain.
Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds,
Accounts receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as
reflected  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position,  approximate  their  fair  value  at  December  31,  2018  and  2017  .  The  fair  value  of
assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).

Note 22 – Legal Proceedings

Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.

In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  various  U.S.  government  inquiries  and  investigations  from  which  civil,  criminal  or  administrative  proceedings  could
result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble
damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also
be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon
current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect on
our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Note 23 – Segment and Revenue Information

Our primary profitability measurements to review a segment’s operating results are Earnings from operations and operating margins. We operate in
four reportable segments: BCA , BDS , BGS , and BCC . All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 53 for the
Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.

BCA  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  principally  to  the  commercial  airline  industry  worldwide.  Revenue  on  commercial
aircraft  contracts  is  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  when  an  aircraft  is  completed  and  accepted  by  the  customer.  Revenue  on  certain  military
derivative aircraft contracts is recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.

BDS engages  in  the  research,  development,  production  and  modification  of  the  following  products  and  related  services:  manned  and  unmanned
military  aircraft  and  weapons  systems,  surveillance  and  engagement,  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  satellite  systems  and  space
exploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.

BGS  provides  parts,  maintenance,  modifications,  logistics  support,  training,  data  analytics  and  information-based  services  to  commercial  and
government customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain services provided to other segments. Revenue on commercial
spare  parts  contracts  is  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  when  a  spare  part  is  delivered  to  the  customer.  Revenue  on  other  contracts  is  generally
recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.

BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.

While our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors  are located in Europe and
Japan. Revenues, including foreign military sales, are reported by customer location and consist of the following:

represented 31% , 31% and 30% of consolidated  revenues  for  2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Approximately 4% of operating assets were
located outside the United States as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

The following tables present BCA, BDS and BGS revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated in a number of ways, such as geographic
location, contract type and the method of revenue recognition. We believe these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our
revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Backlog  is  converted  into  revenue  in  future  periods  as  work  is  performed,  primarily  based  on  the  cost  incurred  or  at  delivery  and  acceptance  of
products, depending on the applicable accounting method.

Our backlog at December 31, 2018 was $490,481 . We expect approximately 19% to be converted to revenue through 2019 and approximately 65%
through 2022 , with the remainder thereafter.

the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and other

Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other  include  common  internal  services  that  support  Boeing’s  global  business  operations,  intercompany
guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between segments. Such sales include airplanes accounted for as operating leases
and  considered  transferred  to  the  BCC  segment  and  airplanes  transferred  to  the  BDS  segment  for  further  modification  prior  to  delivery  to  the
customer. The revenues and cost of sales for these transfers are eliminated in the Unallocated items, eliminations and other caption. We generally
allocate costs to business segments based on the U.S. federal cost accounting standards. Components of Unallocated items, eliminations and other
are shown in the following table.

Pension costs, comprising GAAP service and prior service costs, are allocated to BCA and the commercial operations at BGS. Pension costs are
allocated  to  BDS  and  BGS  businesses  supporting  government  customers  using  U.S.  Government  Cost  Accounting  Standards  (  CAS  ),  which
employ  different  actuarial  assumptions  and  accounting  conventions  than  GAAP  .  These  costs  are  allocable  to  government  contracts.  Other
postretirement benefit costs are allocated to business segments based on CAS , which is generally based on benefits paid. FAS/CAS service cost
adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the
business segments. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service
cost. These expenses are included in Other income/(loss), net .

Gross profit is calculated as Total revenues minus Total costs and expenses. Total costs and expenses includes Cost of products, Cost of services
and Boeing Capital interest expense.

During the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $412 related to the settlement of the 2013-2014 federal tax audit. During the fourth
quarter of 2017, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA, we recorded provisional tax benefits of $1,271 , primarily related to the remeasurement of
net U.S. deferred tax liabilities.

During 2018 and 2017, higher estimated costs to complete the KC-46A Tanker contract for the U.S. Air Force resulted in reach-forward losses. We
recorded $81 , $426 , $179 and $50 in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively. We recorded $138 and $314 in the first and
third quarters of 2017.

During the third quarter of 2018, upon contract award, we recorded charges of $400 associated with anticipated losses on the T-X Trainer and $291
on the MQ-25 Stingray.

During the second quarter of 2018, we recorded a charge of $148 related to the outcome of the Spirit litigation, including the write-off  of $137 of
receivables.

We increased our quarterly dividend from $1.42 to $1.71 in December 2017 and to $2.06 in December 2018.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the
financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  of  December  31,  2018  and 2017 ,  and  the
results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2018  ,  in  conformity  with  accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2018  ,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal
Control
–
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  February  8,  2019  ,
expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements, in 2018 the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with
customers.

Basis for Opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's
financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  PCAOB  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 ,
based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal
Control
–
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the
Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
consolidated  financial  statements  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2018  ,  of  the  Company  and  our  report  dated  February  8,  2019  ,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph related to the Company’s change in method
of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control
over financial reporting at KLX Inc., which was acquired on October 9, 2018 and whose financial statements constitute approximately 4% of Total
assets and less than 1% of each Total revenues and Earnings from operations of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2018. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at KLX Inc.

Basis for Opinion

The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the
effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all material  respects.  Our  audit  included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A
company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of

115

Table of Contents

management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized
acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company’s  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  financial  statements.  Because  of  its  inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2018 and have
concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  as  such  term  is  defined  in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
on  the  framework  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation  under  the  framework  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework,  our  management  concluded  that  our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018 .

Our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 did not include an assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of KLX Inc. (KLX), which was acquired on October 9, 2018. The operating results of KLX are
included in our consolidated financial statements from the period subsequent to the acquisition date and represent approximately 4 percent of our
Total assets as of December 31, 2018 and less than 1 percent of each our Total revenues and Earnings from operations for the year then ended.
We will perform an assessment of the effectiveness of KLX’s internal control over financial reporting within one year of the date of acquisition.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.

(c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2018 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
