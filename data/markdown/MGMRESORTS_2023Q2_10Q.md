MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION

Organization. MGM Resorts International, a Delaware corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or unless the
context  requires  otherwise,  the  “Company”)  is  a  global  gaming  and  entertainment  company  with  domestic  and  international  locations  featuring  hotels  and
casinos, convention, dining, and retail offerings, and sports betting and online gaming operations.

As  of  June  30,  2023,  the  Company’s  domestic  casino  resorts  include  the  following  integrated  casino,  hotel  and  entertainment  resorts  in  Las  Vegas,
Nevada:  Aria  (including  Vdara),  Bellagio,  The  Cosmopolitan  of  Las  Vegas  (“The  Cosmopolitan”),  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  (including  The  Signature),
Mandalay  Bay,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York,  Park  MGM,  and  Excalibur.  The  Company  also  operates  MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan,  MGM
National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland, MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts, Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Empire City in
Yonkers, New York, MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio, and Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi. Additionally, the Company operates The Park, a
dining and entertainment district located between New York-New York and Park MGM. The Company leases the real estate assets of its domestic properties
pursuant to triple-net lease agreements, as further discussed in Note 8.

The  Company  has  an  approximate  56%  controlling  interest  in  MGM  China  Holdings  Limited  (together  with  its  subsidiaries,  “MGM  China”),  which
owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”). MGM Grand Paradise owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, two integrated casino,
hotel and entertainment resorts in Macau, as well as the related gaming concession and land concessions.

The Company also owns LeoVegas AB (“LeoVegas”), a consolidated subsidiary that has global online gaming operations headquartered in Sweden and
Malta. Additionally, the Company and its venture partner, Entain plc, each have a 50% ownership interest in BetMGM, LLC (“BetMGM”), an unconsolidated
affiliate, which provides online sports betting and gaming in certain jurisdictions in North America.

Japan. In April 2023, the Japanese government officially certified the Area Development Plan previously submitted by the city/prefecture of Osaka and

the Company’s 50% owned unconsolidated venture.

MGM Grand Paradise gaming concession. Gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to six
different  concessionaires.  On  December  16,  2022,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  was  awarded  a  ten-year  concession  contract  to  permit  the  operation  of  games  of
chance or other games in casinos in Macau, which commenced on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the gaming concession.

Reportable segments. The Company has three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. See Note 12 for

additional information about the Company’s segments.

Impact of COVID-19 - Update. On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the
exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid
antigen test result, and on February 6, 2023 all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. As of June 30, 2023, all of the Company’s properties
were open and not subject to any COVID-19 related operating restrictions.

NOTE 2 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been
condensed  or  omitted.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Company’s  2022  annual  consolidated  financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In  the  opinion  of  management,  the  accompanying  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  contain  all  adjustments,  which  include  only  normal
recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company’s interim financial statements. The results for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.

Principles of consolidation. The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is
the  primary  beneficiary  of  a  variable  interest  entity  (“VIE”).  The  Company  consolidates  its  investment  in  a  VIE  when  it  determines  that  it  is  its  primary
beneficiary.  The  Company  may  change  its  original  assessment  of  a  VIE  upon  subsequent  events  such  as  the  modification  of  contractual  arrangements  that
affect  the  characteristics  or  adequacy  of  the  entity’s  equity  investments  at  risk  and  the  disposition  of  all  or  a  portion  of  an  interest  held  by  the  primary
beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.

The Company has a 5% ownership interest in the venture that owns and leases back the real estate assets of Bellagio (the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”).
Bellagio BREIT Venture is a VIE of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the venture. The
Company’s maximum exposure to loss in Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment of $55 million as of June 30, 2023, assuming
no  future  capital  funding  requirements,  plus  the  exposure  to  loss  resulting  from  the  Company’s  guarantee  of  the  debt  of  Bellagio  BREIT  Venture,  which
guarantee is immaterial as of June 30, 2023, as further discussed in Note 9.

For entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which
the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial
interest based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling
interest  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  all  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  are  eliminated  in  consolidation.  If  the  entity  does  not  qualify  for
consolidation under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company
generally accounts for the entity under the equity method, such as BetMGM, which does not qualify for consolidation as the Company has joint control, given
the entity is structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate in the decision making process, which prevents the Company from
exerting a controlling financial interest in such entity, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810. For entities over which the Company does
not have significant influence, the Company accounts for its equity investment under ASC 321.

Fair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments
in unconsolidated affiliates or equity interests, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value
measurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date  and  is  measured  according  to  a
hierarchy  that  includes:  Level  1  inputs,  such  as  quoted  prices  in  an  active  market;  Level  2  inputs,  which  are  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  comparable
instruments or pricing using observable market data; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value
measurements:

• Level 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments recorded at fair value;
• Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures; See Note 6; and
• Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its debt investments.

Equity  investments.  Fair  value  is  measured  based  upon  trading  prices  on  the  applicable  securities  exchange  for  equity  investments  for  which  the
Company has elected the fair value option of ASC 825 and equity investments accounted for under ASC 321 that have a readily determinable fair value. The
fair value of these investments was $466 million and $461 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is reflected within “Other
long-term assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are recorded in “Other, net” in the statements of operations. For the three and six
months  ended  June  30,  2023,  the  Company  recorded  a  net  gain  on  its  equity  investments  of  $6  million  and  $5  million,  respectively.  For  the  three  and  six
months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a net loss on its equity investments of $23 million and $8 million, respectively.

Debt  investments.  The  Company’s  investments  in  debt  securities  are  classified  as  trading  securities  and  recorded  at  fair  value.  Gains  and  losses  are
recorded in “Other, net” in the statements of operations. Debt securities are considered cash equivalents if the criteria for such classification is met or otherwise
classified as short-term investments within “Prepaid expenses and other” since the investment of cash is available for current operations.

Restricted cash. MGM China’s pledged cash of $87 million and $124 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, securing the
bank guarantees discussed in Note 9 is restricted in use and classified within “Other long-term assets, net.” Such amounts plus “Cash and cash equivalents” on
the  consolidated  balance  sheets  equal  “Cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  restricted  cash”  on  the  consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows  as  of  June  30,  2023  and
December 31, 2022.

Accounts  receivable.  As  of  June  30,  2023  and  December  31,  2022,  the  loss  reserve  on  accounts  receivable  was  $129  million  and  $113  million,

respectively.

Note receivable. In February 2023, the secured note receivable related to the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and the adjacent land was repaid, prior to
maturity, for $170 million, which approximated its carrying value on the date of repayment. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the note receivable
was $167 million and was recorded within “Other long-term assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets.

Accounts payable. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued $60 million and $80 million, respectively, for purchases of

property and equipment within “Accounts and construction payable” on the consolidated balance sheets.

Revenue recognition. Contract and Contract-Related Liabilities. There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and
the recognition of revenue, resulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with
customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations,
which  represents  the  deferred  allocation  of  revenue  relating  to  loyalty  program  incentives  earned,  and  (3)  customer  advances  and  other,  which  is  primarily
funds  deposited  by  customers  before  gaming  play  occurs  (“casino  front  money”)  and  advance  payments  on  goods  and  services  yet  to  be  provided,  such  as
advance ticket sales and deposits on rooms and convention space or for unpaid wagers. These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue
within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.

The January 1, 2023 balances exclude liabilities related to assets held for sale.

Revenue  by  source.  The  Company  presents  the  revenue  earned  disaggregated  by  the  type  or  nature  of  the  good  or  service  (casino,  room,  food  and

beverage, and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 12.

Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains
a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control
over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right
to direct the use of the asset.

The  Company  classifies  a  lease  with  terms  greater  than  twelve  months  as  either  operating  or  finance. At  commencement,  the  right-of-use  (“ROU”)
assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The initial measurement of
ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, such as for the Company’s
triple-net operating leases for which the lessor has provided its implicit rate or provided the assumptions required for the Company to readily determine the rate
implicit in the lease, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Company’s leases,
such as its ground subleases and equipment leases, the Company cannot readily determine the implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental
borrowing rate to discount the lease payments for such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to
extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Company’s triple-net operating leases each contain renewal
periods at the Company’s option, each of which are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. Many of the Company’s leases include fixed
rental  escalation  clauses  that  are  factored  into  the  determination  of  lease  payments.  For  operating  leases,  lease  expense  for  minimum  lease  payments  is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
lease  term  or  useful  life  of  the  ROU  asset  and  the  lease  liability  accretes  interest  based  on  the  interest  method  using  the  discount  rate  determined  at  lease
commencement. Refer to Note 8 for discussion of leases under which the Company is a lessee.

The Company is a lessor under certain other lease arrangements. Lease revenues earned by the Company from third parties are classified within the line
item corresponding to the type or nature of the tenant’s good or service. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, lease revenues from third-party
tenants  include  $19  million  and  $37  million  recorded  within  food  and  beverage  revenue,  respectively,  and  $29  million  and  $59  million  recorded  within
entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, lease revenues from third-
party tenants include $19 million and $33 million recorded within food and beverage revenue, respectively, and $29 million and $55 million recorded within
entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. Lease revenues from the rental of hotel rooms are recorded as rooms revenues
within the consolidated statements of operations.

Redeemable  noncontrolling  interest.  Certain  noncontrolling  interest  parties  have  non-voting  economic  interests  in  MGM  National  Harbor  which
provide  for  annual  preferred  distributions  by  MGM  National  Harbor  to  the  noncontrolling  interest  parties  based  on  a  percentage  of  its  annual  net  gaming
revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90 days after the end of each
fiscal  year.  The  noncontrolling  interest  parties  each  have  the  ability  to  require  MGM  National  Harbor  to  purchase  all  or  a  portion  of  their  interests  for  a
purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula.

The Company has recorded the interests as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets  and  not  stockholders’  equity  because  their  redemption  is  not  exclusively  in  the  Company’s  control. The  interests  were  initially  accounted  for  at  fair
value. Subsequently, the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling
interests to equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The
Company  records  any  changes  caused  by  such  an  adjustment  in  capital  in  excess  of  par  value.  Additionally,  the  carrying  amount  of  the  redeemable
noncontrolling  interests  is  adjusted  for  accrued  annual  preferred  distributions,  with  changes  caused  by  such  adjustments  recorded  within  net  income  (loss)
attributable to noncontrolling interests.

During  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2023  and  2022,  MGM  National  Harbor  purchased  $138  million  and  $21  million  of  interests  from  the

noncontrolling interest parties, respectively.

10

Share repurchases. Shares repurchased pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase plans are retired upon purchase. The cost of the repurchases in
excess of the aggregate par value of the shares reduces capital in excess of par value, to the extent available, with any residual cost applied against retained
earnings.

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

LeoVegas acquisition. On May 2, 2022, the Company commenced a public offer to the shareholders of LeoVegas to tender 100% of the shares at a
price of SEK 61 in cash per share. On September 7, 2022, the Company completed its tender offer and acquired 65% of the outstanding shares of LeoVegas
and, at the completion of an extended acceptance period on September 22, 2022, acquired an additional 2% of outstanding shares, for an aggregate cash tender
price of $370 million. During the tender offer period, the Company had acquired 31% of outstanding shares in open market purchases that had an acquisition-
date fair value of approximately $172 million. As the Company’s previous 31% ownership interest was accounted for at fair value, no gain or loss was recorded
upon  consolidation.  The  remaining  outstanding  shares,  with  a  fair  value  of  approximately  $11  million  based  upon  the  tender  price,  were  settled  by  the
Company  in  cash  in  connection  with  squeeze-out  proceedings  during  the  second  quarter  of  2023. The  acquisition  provides  the  Company  an  opportunity  to
create a scaled global online gaming business.

The Company recognized 100% of the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of LeoVegas at fair value at the date of the acquisition. The fair
value of the acquired equity interests of LeoVegas was determined by the tender price and equaled $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards.
Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests. The Company estimated fair
value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level 3 inputs. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies
under  the  income  approach  based  on  significant  inputs  that  were  not  observable.  The  intangible  assets  include  trademarks,  which  is  an  indefinite-lived
intangible asset, and customer lists and technology, which are finite-lived intangibles that are amortized over each of their estimated useful lives of five years.
Goodwill is primarily attributable to the profitability of LeoVegas in excess of identifiable assets and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill was
assigned to Corporate and other.

The Cosmopolitan acquisition. On May 17, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in the entities that own the operations of The
Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion plus working capital adjustments for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. The acquisition
expands the Company’s customer base and provides a greater depth of choices and experiences for guests in Las Vegas.

The Company recognized 100% of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method,
the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2
inputs, and level 3 inputs. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based
on significant inputs that were not observable. The intangible assets include trademarks, which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and customer lists, which
is amortized over its estimated useful life of seven years. Goodwill, which is deductible for

11

tax purposes, is primarily attributable to the profitability of The Cosmopolitan in excess of identifiable assets as well as expected synergies. All of the goodwill
was assigned to the Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment.

VICI Transaction. Prior to the closing of the VICI Transaction (defined below), MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”) was a consolidated subsidiary
of  the  Company.  Substantially  all  of  its  assets  were  owned  by  and  substantially  all  of  its  operations  were  conducted  through  MGM  Growth  Properties
Operating Partnership LP ("MGP OP”). MGP had two classes of common shares: Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Company owned MGP’s Class
B share, through which it held a controlling interest in MGP as it was entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s
shares. The Company and MGP each held MGP OP units representing limited partner interests in MGP OP.

Additionally, the Company had leased the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike
Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield from MGP OP. The
Company also leased, and continues to lease, the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas from subsidiaries of a venture that was 50.1%
owned by a subsidiary of MGP OP at the time of the transaction (such venture, the “MGP BREIT Venture”).

On April 29, 2022, VICI Properties Inc. (“VICI”) acquired MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). MGP Class
A shareholders received 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and the Company received 1.366 units
of VICI OP in exchange for each MGP OP unit held by the Company. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class
A share to the five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP
redeemed  the  majority  of  the  Company’s VICI  OP  units  for  cash  consideration  of  $4.4  billion,  with  the  Company  retaining  an  approximate  1%  ownership
interest in VICI OP that had a fair value of approximately $375 million. MGP’s Class B share that was held by the Company was cancelled. Accordingly, the
Company no longer held a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the transactions.

12

Further, the Company entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI as discussed in Note 8. The Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas
lease remained unchanged.

In connection with the transactions, the Company recognized a $2.3 billion gain recorded within “Gain on REIT transactions, net.” The gain reflects the
fair value of consideration received of $4.8 billion plus the carrying amount of noncontrolling interest immediately prior to the transactions of $3.2 billion less
the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities and accumulated comprehensive income derecognized of $5.7 billion.

The major classes of assets and liabilities derecognized were as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents
Income tax receivable

The Mirage transaction. On December 19, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard
Rock Entertainment, Inc. (“Hard Rock”) for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, or $1.1 billion, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At
closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI was amended to remove The Mirage and to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent.

Gold Strike Tunica. On February 15, 2023, the Company completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE Gaming Holdings, LLC
(“CNE”), a subsidiary of Cherokee Nation Business, for cash consideration of $450 million, or $474 million, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction
costs. At closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and to reflect a $40 million reduction in annual
cash rent. The Company recognized a $399 million gain recorded within “Property transactions, net.” The gain reflects the net cash consideration less the net
carrying value of the assets and liabilities derecognized of $75 million.

The operations of Gold Strike Tunica are not classified as discontinued operations because the Company concluded that the sale is not a strategic shift

that has a major effect on the Company’s operations or its financial results and it does not represent a major geographic segment or product line.

MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession and concession. Pursuant to the gaming concession contract that MGM Grand Paradise entered into

with the Macau government, which commenced January 1, 2023, MGM Grand Paradise

15

is required, among other things, to pay a fixed annual premium and an annual variable premium based on the number of gaming tables and machines for the
term of the gaming concession. Additionally, in connection with the expiration of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession on December 31, 2022, the
casino  areas  of  MGM  Cotai  and  MGM  Macau  reverted,  free  of  charge  and  without  any  encumbrances,  to  the  Macau  government,  which  became  the  legal
owner  of  the  reverted  gaming  assets.  Upon  the  commencement  of  the  gaming  concession,  the  gaming  assets  were  temporarily  transferred  to  MGM  Grand
Paradise for the duration of the concession term in return for annual payments determined by square meters of the reverted casino areas.

On January 1, 2023, MGM Grand Paradise recorded an intangible asset, included within “Gaming rights” above, of $226 million for the right to conduct
gaming  and  operate  the  reverted  gaming  equipment  and  gaming  areas  and  a  corresponding  liability  for  the  in-substance  consideration  to  be  paid  over  the
concession term for such rights, which is the unconditional obligation of the fixed and variable annual premiums, as well as the payments relating to the use of
the reverted gaming assets. The initial value of the intangible asset and liability were measured as the present value of these payments based upon the approved
number of gaming tables and slot machines, estimates of the Macau average price index, and square meters of the reverted casino areas, each as of January 1,
2023. The current portion of $7 million and noncurrent portion of $212 million of the remaining liability was recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” and
“Other long-term liabilities,” respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023. The gaming concession intangible asset is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over the ten-year term of the gaming concession contract. The fully amortized gaming subconcession intangible asset was derecognized
upon the expiration of the gaming subconcession and corresponding commencement of the gaming concession contract.

requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require the Company to maintain cash security or provide one or
more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to 6 months or 1 year of rent, as applicable to the circumstances, under the VICI lease, 1 year
of  rent  under  the  Mandalay  Bay  and  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  lease,  the Aria  and  Vdara  lease,  and  The  Cosmopolitan  lease,  and  2  years  of  rent  under  the
Bellagio lease. The Company was in compliance with its applicable covenants under its leases as of June 30, 2023.

Bellagio lease. The Company leases the real estate assets of Bellagio from Bellagio BREIT Venture. The Bellagio lease commenced November 15, 2019
and has an initial term of 30 years with two 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s option, with a fixed 2% rent escalator for the first 10 years
and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3% during the 11th through 20th years and
4% thereafter. Annual cash rent payments for the fourth lease year that commenced on December 1, 2022 increased to $260 million as a result of the 2% fixed
annual escalator.

Mandalay  Bay  and  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  lease.  The  Company  leases  the  real  estate  assets  of  Mandalay  Bay  and  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  from

renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s option, with a fixed 2% rent escalator for the first 15 years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of

Vdara lease commenced September 28, 2021 and has an initial term of 30 years with three 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s option, with
a fixed 2% rent escalator for the first 15 years, and thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap
of 3%. Annual cash rent payments for the second lease year that commenced on October 1, 2022 increased to $219 million as a result of the 2% fixed annual
escalator.

commenced April 29, 2022 and has an initial term of 25 years, with three 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s option, with a fixed 2% rent
escalator  for  the  first  10  years,  and  thereafter,  an  escalator  equal  to  the  greater  of  2%  and  the  CPI  increase  during  the  prior  year  subject  to  a  cap  of  3%.
Additionally, the VICI lease provides VICI with a right of first offer with respect to any further gaming development by the Company on the undeveloped land
adjacent  to  Empire  City,  which  VICI  may  exercise  should  the  Company  elect  to  sell  the  property. Annual  cash  rent  payments  for  the  first  lease  year  that
commenced on April 29, 2022 was $860 million. In December 2022, in connection with the sale of the operations of The Mirage, the VICI lease was amended
to remove The Mirage and to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent, thereby reducing the annual cash rent payments to $770 million. In February
2023,  in  connection  with  the  sale  of  the  operations  of  Gold  Strike  Tunica,  the  VICI  lease  was  amended  to  remove  Gold  Strike  Tunica  and  to  reflect  a
$40 million reduction in annual cash rent, thereby reducing the annual cash rent payments to $730 million. The modification resulted in a reassessment of the
lease classification and remeasurement of the VICI lease, with the lease continuing to be accounted for as an operating lease and $507 million of net operating
lease ROU and $516 million of lease liabilities allocable to Gold Strike Tunica were derecognized (see Note 3). Annual cash rent payments for the second lease
year that commenced on May 1, 2023 increased to $745 million as a result of the 2% fixed annual escalator.

The Company is required to pay the rent payments under the ground leases of the Borgata, Beau Rivage, and National Harbor through the term of the
VICI lease. The ground subleases of Beau Rivage and National Harbor are classified as operating leases and the ground sublease of Borgata is classified as a
finance lease.

Inc. The Cosmopolitan lease commenced May 17, 2022 and has an initial term of 30 years with three 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s
option, with a fixed 2% rent escalator for the first 15 years, and thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year,
subject to a cap of 3%. Annual cash rent payments for the second lease year that commenced on June 1, 2023 was $204 million.

Litigation. The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Management does not

believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Other  guarantees. The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  party  to  various  guarantee  contracts  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  which  are  generally
supported by letters of credit issued by financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to
$1.35  billion.  At  June  30,  2023,  $29  million  in  letters  of  credit  were  outstanding  under  the  Company’s  senior  credit  facility.  The  amount  of  available
borrowings under the credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.

MGM  China  bank  guarantees.  In  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  gaming  concession  in  January  2023,  bank  guarantees  were  provided  to  the
government of Macau in the amount of MOP 1 billion (approximately $124 million as of June 30, 2023) to warrant the fulfillment of labor liabilities and of
damages or losses that may result if there is noncompliance with the concession. The guarantees expire 180 days after the end of the concession term. As of
December  31,  2022,  MOP  1  billion  (approximately  $124  million  as  of  December  31,  2022)  of  the  bank  guarantees  were  secured  by  pledged  cash  and,  in
connection  with  a  release  of  MOP  300  million  of  such  pledged  cash  during  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2023,  MOP  700  million  of  the  bank  guarantees
(approximately $87 million as of June 30, 2023) were secured by pledged cash as of June 30, 2023.

Shortfall guarantees. The Company provides shortfall guarantees of the $3.01 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and
unpaid thereon) of Bellagio BREIT Venture, the landlord of Bellagio, which matures in 2029 and of the $3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any
interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of the landlords of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas, which matures in 2032 and has an anticipated repayment
date

20

of  March  2030. The  terms  of  the  shortfall  guarantees  provide  that  after  the  lenders  have  exhausted  certain  remedies  to  collect  on  the  obligations  under  the
indebtedness,  the  Company  would  then  be  responsible  for  any  shortfall  between  the  value  of  the  collateral,  which  is  the  real  estate  assets  of  the  applicable
property owned by the landlord, and the debt obligation. The guarantees are accounted for under ASC 460 at fair value; such value is immaterial.

NOTE 11 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

MGM Resorts International stock repurchases. In March 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock
repurchase plan, and, in February 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. Under these stock
repurchase plans, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements. Repurchases of common
stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded
from  doing  so  under  insider  trading  laws. The  timing,  volume  and  nature  of  stock  repurchases  will  be  at  the  sole  discretion  of  management,  dependent  on
market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 32 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount
of $1.1 billion. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 56 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate
amount of $2.1 billion, which included the February 2022 repurchase of 4.5 million shares for an aggregate amount of $202.5 million from funds managed by
Corvex Management LP, a related party. Repurchased shares were retired.

During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 15 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount
of $626 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 27 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate
amount  of  $1.1  billion.  In  connection  with  these  repurchases,  the  March  2022  stock  repurchase  plan  was  completed.  Repurchased  shares  were  retired. The
remaining availability under the February 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2023.

Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 2 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount

of $88 million, excluding excise tax. Repurchased shares were retired.

The  Company’s  management  views  each  of  its  casino  properties  as  an  operating  segment.  Operating  segments  are  aggregated  based  on  their  similar
economic  characteristics,  types  of  customers,  types  of  services  and  products  provided,  the  regulatory  environments  in  which  they  operate  and  their
management  and  reporting  structure. The  Company  has  aggregated  its  operating  segments  into  the  following  reportable  segments:  Las Vegas  Strip  Resorts,
Regional Operations and MGM China.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada: Aria (including Vdara), Bellagio, The
Cosmopolitan (upon its acquisition in May 2022), MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The
Mirage (until its disposition in December 2022), Luxor, New York-New York (including The Park), Excalibur, and Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas).

Regional  Operations.  Regional  Operations  consists  of  the  following  casino  properties:  MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan;  Beau  Rivage  in
Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi (until its disposition in February 2023); Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National
Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York; and MGM Northfield Park
in Northfield Park, Ohio.

MGM China. MGM China consists of MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.

The  Company’s  operations  related  to  LeoVegas  (upon  its  acquisition  in  September  2022),  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  and  certain  other
corporate operations and management services have not been identified as separate reportable segments; therefore, these operations are included in “Corporate
and other” in the following segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidated results.

Adjusted Property EBITDAR is the Company’s reportable segment GAAP measure, which management utilizes as the primary profit measure for its
reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating
income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses,  property  transactions,  net,  gain  on  REIT  transactions,  net,  rent
expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also
excludes corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease
with MGP that eliminated in consolidation.

NOTE 13 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

MGP. Prior to the closing of the VICI Transaction, the Company leased the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM,
Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM
Springfield pursuant to a master lease with MGP.

The  annual  cash  rent  payments  under  the  master  lease  with  MGP  for  the  seventh  lease  year,  which  commenced  on  April  1,  2022,  increased  to
$877 million from $873 million, due to the sixth 2% annual base rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2022, as the adjusted net revenue to rent ratio
on which such escalator was contingent was met, which increased annual cash rent by $16 million, partially offset by the percentage rent reset that went into
effect on April 1, 2022, calculated based on the percentage of average actual annual net revenue of the leased properties during the preceding five year period,
which decreased annual cash rent by $12 million.

All intercompany transactions, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in the Company’s consolidation of MGP. The

public ownership of MGP’s Class A shares was recognized as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2022, the Company completed the VICI Transaction, which resulted in the deconsolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 3 for additional information
on the VICI Transaction. As part of the transaction, the Company entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. Refer to Note 8 for further
discussion on the master lease with VICI.

Item 2.         Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Please see “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions that
may cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our
historical financial statements and related notes thereto and the other disclosures contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which were included in our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 24, 2023. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that
may  be  expected  for  future  periods.  MGM  Resorts  International  together  with  its  subsidiaries  may  be  referred  to  as  “we,”  “us”  or  “our.”  MGM  China
Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its subsidiaries is referred to as
“MGP.”

Overview of strategic business developments

In February 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of $450 million, or $474 million, net of
purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million
reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.

In April 2023, the Japanese government officially certified the Area Development Plan (“ADP”) previously submitted by the city/prefecture of Osaka,

Japan and our 50% owned venture.

In April 2023, LeoVegas entered into an agreement to acquire the majority ownership of digital gaming developer, Push Gaming Holding Limited. The

transaction is subject to regulatory and customary approvals and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.

Impact of COVID-19 - Update

On  January  8,  2023,  Macau  lifted  the  majority  of  its  COVID-19  pandemic  travel  and  quarantine  restrictions  with  the  exception  of  overseas  visitors
travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result, and on
February  6,  2023  all  remaining  COVID-19  travel  restrictions  were  removed. As  of  June  30,  2023,  all  of  our  properties  were  open  and  not  subject  to  any
COVID-19 related operating restrictions.

Key Performance Indicators

Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:

•

•

Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slot handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.
Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for baccarat and 19.0%
to 23.0% for non-baccarat; and

Hotel  revenue  indicators  (for  Las Vegas  Strip  Resorts)  –  hotel  occupancy  (a  volume  indicator);  average  daily  rate  (“ADR,”  a  price  indicator);  and
revenue per available room (“RevPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is
the  average  price  of  occupied  rooms  per  day,  includes  the  impact  of  complimentary  rooms.  Complimentary  room  rates  are  determined  based  on
standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate
suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value
of suites.

Consolidated net revenues increased 21% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to a 418% increase
at  MGM  China  as  a  result  of  the  removal  of  travel  and  entry  restrictions  in  Macau,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  at  our  Regional  Operations  of  3%  due
primarily to the disposition of Gold Strike Tunica. Net revenues at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts were flat.

Consolidated operating income decreased 84% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to a
$2.3 billion gain in the prior year quarter related to the VICI Transaction, an increase in rent expense recorded within general and administrative expense for
the  VICI  and  The  Cosmopolitan  leases,  which  commenced  in April  2022  and  May  2022,  respectively,  partially  offset  by  the  increase  in  net  revenues,  as
discussed  above,  and  a  decrease  in  depreciation  and  amortization  expense.  Depreciation  and  amortization  expense  decreased  $163  million  compared  to  the
prior year quarter, due primarily to the amortization in the prior year quarter related to the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession, which became fully
amortized as of December 31, 2022, and the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022.

Consolidated net revenues increased 28% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year period due primarily to a 230% increase at
MGM  China  as  a  result  of  the  removal  of  travel  and  entry  restrictions  in  Macau,  a  14%  increase  at  our  Las Vegas  Strip  Resorts  as  the  current  year  period
benefited from the inclusion of a full year of operating results of The Cosmopolitan, which was partially offset by the disposition of The Mirage, and a 1%
increase at our Regional Operations as a result of increases in non-gaming revenues, partially offset by the disposition of Gold Strike Tunica.

Consolidated operating income decreased 56% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a
$2.3 billion gain in the prior year period related to the VICI Transaction and an increase in rent expense recorded within general and administrative expense for
the VICI and The Cosmopolitan leases, partially offset by a $399 million gain in the current year period related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike
Tunica recorded in property transactions, net, the increase in net revenues, as discussed above, and a $248 million decrease in depreciation and amortization
expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased compared to the prior year period due to the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022 and due to the
amortization in the prior year period related to the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts casino revenue decreased 1% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to an
increase in non-gaming incentives and increased 2% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in
table games drop and slot handle. Both the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 benefited from a full period of operating results of The Cosmopolitan,
partially offset by the disposition of The Mirage.

Non-operating Results

Interest Expense

Gross interest expense was $113 million and $137 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $243 million and $333
million  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  The  decrease  from  the  prior  year  periods  is  due  primarily  to  a  decrease  in  debt
outstanding as a result of the repayment of the $1.0 billion 7.75% senior notes in March 2022, the derecognition of MGP OP’s senior notes in connection with
the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022, and the repayment of the $1.25 billion 6% senior notes in March 2023, and the decrease in the debt outstanding
under MGM China’s first revolving credit facility. See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.

Other, net

Other, net was income of $24 million and expense of $43 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change from the
prior  year  quarter  is  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  interest  and  dividend  income  of  $28  million  and  a  change  in  the  gain/loss  on  the  fair  value  of  equity
instruments of $29 million. Other, net was income of $70 million and expense of $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The
change from the prior year period is primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income of $80 million.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 13.8% and 22.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 26.1% and 25.3% for

the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The effective rate for the

31

three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was favorably impacted by an increase in Macau income that was offset by expiring net operating losses from prior
years subject to valuation allowances. The effective rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was driven primarily by tax expense recorded on the
VICI Transaction and was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance for Macau deferred tax assets and by losses in Macau from which
we could not benefit, partially offset by the favorable impact of a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the VICI Transaction.

Reportable segment GAAP measure

“Adjusted Property EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments
and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense),
taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, gain on REIT transactions, net, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-
net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes corporate expense
and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in
consolidation. “Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.

Non-GAAP measures

“Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired
operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating
segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition. Accordingly, for Las Vegas Strip Resorts, we have excluded the Adjusted
Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022 and of The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition
on December 19, 2022, as applicable. For Regional Operations, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of Gold Strike Tunica for the periods prior
to its disposition on February 15, 2023, as applicable.

Same-Store Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  and  is  presented  solely  as  a  supplemental  disclosure  to  reported  GAAP  measures
because  management  believes  this  measure  is  useful  in  providing  meaningful  period-to-period  comparisons  of  the  results  of  our  operations  for  operating
segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same-
Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to our
reportable  segment  GAAP  measure  or  net  income,  or  as  an  alternative  to  any  other  measure  determined  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted
Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial
measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of our reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure
to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included herein.

“Adjusted EBITDAR” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-
up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and income from
unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.

Adjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as
a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors
as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and
should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, we
believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be
significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within
the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales
of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment
charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes
rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and
ground  leases  provides  useful  information  to  analysts,  lenders,  financial  institutions,  and  investors  when  valuing  the  Company,  as  well  as  comparing  the
Company’s results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in

32

capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases.
However,  as  discussed  herein, Adjusted  EBITDAR  should  not  be  viewed  as  a  measure  of  overall  operating  performance,  an  indicator  of  our  performance,
considered  in  isolation,  or  construed  as  an  alternative  to  operating  income  or  net  income,  or  as  an  alternative  to  cash  flows  from  operating  activities,  as  a
measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because this measure is
not  presented  on  a  GAAP  basis  and  excludes  certain  expenses,  including  the  rent  expense  related  to  triple-net  operating  leases  and  ground  leases,  and  is
provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may
calculate  Adjusted  EBITDAR  in  a  different  manner  and  such  differences  may  be  material.  We  have  significant  uses  of  cash  flows,  including  capital
expenditures,  interest  payments,  taxes,  real  estate  triple-net  lease  and  ground  lease  payments,  and  debt  principal  repayments,  which  are  not  reflected  in
Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDAR is included herein.

Guarantor Financial Information

As of June 30, 2023, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee
our senior credit facility. Our principal debt arrangements are not guaranteed by MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC
(the entity that owns the operations of MGM Springfield), MGM Sports & Interactive Gaming, LLC (the entity that owns our 50% interest in BetMGM), and
each  of  their  respective  subsidiaries.  Our  foreign  subsidiaries,  including  LeoVegas,  MGM  China,  and  each  of  their  respective  subsidiaries,  are  also  not
guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility or any of our future capital markets
indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes
further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will
be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.

33

The  guarantees  provided  by  the  subsidiary  guarantors  rank  senior  in  right  of  payment  to  any  future  subordinated  debt  of  ours  or  such  subsidiary
guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and
other  obligations  of  our  subsidiaries  that  do  not  guarantee  the  senior  notes.  In  addition,  the  obligations  of  each  subsidiary  guarantor  under  its  guarantee  is
limited  so  as  not  to  constitute  a  fraudulent  conveyance  under  applicable  law,  which  may  eliminate  the  subsidiary  guarantor’s  obligations  or  reduce  such
obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.

The summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. Assets held for sale and liabilities
related  to  assets  held  for  sale  associated  with  Gold  Strike  Tunica  are  included  within  current  assets  and  other  current  liabilities,  respectively,  within  the
summarized financial information as of December 31, 2022.

Operating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by
changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in
the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $933 million in the prior year period. The change from the prior year period was due primarily to the increase
in Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  at  our  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  and  MGM  China  discussed  within  the  Results  of  Operations  section  above,  a  decrease  in
working  capital  primarily  related  to  collection  of  receivables,  and  a  decrease  in  cash  paid  for  interest,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  triple-net  lease  rent
payments and the change in cash paid (refunded) for taxes, net.

Investing activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital
investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our
resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our
public spaces and hotel rooms.

Cash used in investing activities was $59 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $2.2 billion
in the prior year period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we received $447 million in net cash related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica,
received $153 million in cash related to the principal portion of the Circus Circus Las Vegas note receivable that was repaid, made payments of $393 million in
capital  expenditures,  as  further  discussed  below,  contributed  $50  million  to  BetMGM,  and  made  $216  million  in  net  investments  in  debt  securities.  In
comparison, in the prior year period we received $4.4 billion in net cash proceeds related to the VICI

34

Transaction, which were partially offset by net cash paid of $1.6 billion to acquire The Cosmopolitan, payments of $237 million in capital expenditures, as
further discussed below, and contributed $150 million to BetMGM.

Capital Expenditures

We made capital expenditures of $393 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, of which $20 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of
capital expenditures relating to the gaming concession investment. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and corporate and
other entities of $373 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology, room remodels, and convention center remodels.

We made capital expenditures of $237 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, of which $16 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures
at  our  Las Vegas  Strip  Resorts,  Regional  Operations  and  corporate  entities  of  $221  million  primarily  related  to  expenditures  in  information  technology  and
room remodels.

Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $2.5 billion in the prior year
period.  In  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2023,  we  had  net  repayments  of  debt  of  $2.0  billion,  as  further  discussed  below,  distributed  $162  million  to
noncontrolling interest owners, and repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of
$162 million, as further discussed below, distributed $206 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and repurchased $2.1 billion of our common stock.

Borrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt

During  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2023,  we  had  net  repayments  of  debt  of  $2.0  billion,  which  consisted  of  the  repayment  of  $1.25  billion  of
aggregate principal amount of our 6% senior notes due 2023 upon maturity and aggregate net repayments of $758 million on MGM China’s revolving credit
facilities.

During  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2022,  we  had  net  repayments  of  debt  of  $162  million,  which  consisted  of  the  repayment  of  $1.0  billion  of
aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022, net draws of $40 million on MGP OP’s revolving credit facility, and net borrowings of $798
million on MGM China’s first revolving credit facility to fund an increase in share capital of MGM Grand Paradise pursuant to the capital requirements under
the new Macau gaming law and for general corporate purposes.

Dividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners, and Share Repurchases

During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we paid $1.1 billion relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans.
See Note 11 for further information on the stock repurchases. In connection with those repurchases, the March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was
completed. In February 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. The remaining availability under the
February 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2023.

During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased and retired $2.1 billion of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans.

During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share in March and June 2022, totaling $2 million and MGP OP paid
$283 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $117 million and MGP received $166 million, which MGP concurrently paid
as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash

We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash
management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into
central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to
time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law,
as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures
and commitments.

35

On  February  8,  2023,  we  announced  that  the  Board  of  Directors  has  determined  to  suspend  the  ongoing  dividends  in  light  of  our  current  preferred
method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. To the extent we determine to reinstate the dividend in the future, determinations
regarding  the  declaration  and  payment  of  dividends,  if  any,  will  be  at  the  discretion  of  our  board  of  directors  and  will  depend  on  then-existing  conditions,
including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion, of which MGM China held $448 million, and we had $6.7 billion in principal
amount of indebtedness, including $708 million outstanding under MGM China’s first revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit
facility or MGM China’s second revolving credit facility. In June 2023, MGM China amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving
credit facility, which extended the maturity date of each facility to May 2026, increased the amount to which MGM China may upsize its second revolving
credit facility, removed the requirement for the MGM China first revolving credit facility to be fully drawn prior to utilizing the MGM China second revolving
credit facility, and extended the financial covenant waivers through December 31, 2024.

As of June 30, 2023, our expected cash interest payments over the next twelve months are approximately $180 million to $190 million, excluding MGM

China, and approximately $395 million to $405 million on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China.

We are required, as of June 30, 2023, to make annual cash rent payments of $1.7 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements,
which  triple-net  leases  are  also  subject  to  annual  escalators  and  also  require  us  to  pay  substantially  all  costs  associated  with  the  lease,  including  real  estate
taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 8 for discussion of our leases and lease
obligations.

We  have  planned  capital  expenditures  expected  over  the  remainder  of  2023  of  approximately  $450  million  to  $460  million  domestically,  which  is
inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at
the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately $50 million to $80 million at MGM China, which is inclusive of the estimated amount of
the gaming concession investment for 2023 that relates to capital projects.

We  continue  to  explore  potential  development  or  investment  opportunities,  such  as  expanding  our  global  online  gaming  presence  and  pursuing  a
commercial  gaming  facility  in  New  York,  which  may  require  cash  commitments  in  the  future. Additionally,  we  expect  to  have  cash  commitments  of  $80
million  to  $100  million  over  the  remainder  of  2023  relating  to  our  Japan  venture’s  planned  integrated  resort  in  Osaka  for  which  the  amount  and  timing  is
subject to change and will be dependent upon funding of the venture from noncontrolling interests and the timing and amount of financing received by the
venture.

We also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased

approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $88 million, excluding excise tax. Repurchased shares were retired.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

A complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There

have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since year end.

Market Risk

Our primary market exposures are to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity market trading prices.

Interest rate risk. We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate
risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally
does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is
acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods
subsequent to the periods when the debt matures.

36

As  of  June  30,  2023,  variable  rate  borrowings  represented  approximately  11%  of  our  total  borrowings.  The  following  table  provides  additional

information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates:

Foreign currency risk. Our worldwide operations are conducted in multiple foreign currencies, which primarily are the Hong Kong dollar and Macau
pataca,  but  we  report  our  financial  results  in  U.S.  dollars.  We  manage  the  foreign  currency  risk  through  normal  operating  activities  and,  when  deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

MGM China holds U.S. dollar denominated debt, which may cause foreign currency transaction losses. The Macau pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong
dollar and the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, however, the current peg rates may not remain at the same level and possible changes to the peg
rates may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in
policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. As of
June 30, 2023, a 1% adverse change in the exchange rate would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million.

We hold forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. As of June 30, 2023,
the notional amount of the forward contracts was $316 million with a fair value of ($14 million) and a 10% adverse change in the exchange rate would result in
a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $32 million.

Equity price risk. We have investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies that are subject to equity price volatility. As of June 30, 2023,

a 10% adverse change in the quoted market prices would result in an impact to earnings of $47 million.

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

This  Form  10-Q  contains  “forward-looking  statements”  within  the  meaning  of  the  U.S.  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act  of  1995.  Forward-
looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “will,” “may” and similar
references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements we make regarding the impact of COVID-19
on our business, expectations regarding the impact of macroeconomic trends on our business, our ability to execute on ongoing and future strategic initiatives,
including the development of an integrated resort in Japan, a commercial gaming facility in New York and investments we make in online sports betting and
iGaming,  the  expansion  of  LeoVegas  and  the  MGM  digital  brand,  positioning  BetMGM  as  a  leader  in  sports  betting  and  iGaming,  the  closing  of  the  Push
Gaming Holding Limited acquisition, amounts we will spend on capital expenditures and investments, our expectations with respect to future share repurchases
and  cash  dividends  on  our  common  stock,  dividends  and  distributions  we  will  receive  from  MGM  China,  amounts  projected  to  be  realized  as  deferred  tax
assets, and our ability to achieve our public social impact and sustainability goals. The foregoing is not a complete list of all forward-looking statements we
make.

Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions.
Because  forward-looking  statements  relate  to  the  future,  they  are  subject  to  inherent  uncertainties,  risks,  and  changes  in  circumstances  that  are  difficult  to
predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor
guarantees or assurances of future performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, regional, national or global political,
economic, business, competitive, market, and regulatory conditions and the following:

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments under our triple-net leases

In February 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. Under the stock repurchase plans, we
may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements. Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a
Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be purchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The
timing, volume and nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management, dependent on market conditions, applicable securities laws, and
other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. All shares we repurchased during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 were purchased pursuant to
our publicly announced stock repurchase plan and have been retired.
