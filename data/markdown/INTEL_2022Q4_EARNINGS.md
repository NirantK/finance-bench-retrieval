Declares quarterly cash dividend of $0.365 per share.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 26, 2023 -- Intel Corporation today reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 financial
results. The company also announced that its board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.365 per
share on the company’s common stock, which will be payable on March 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of
February 7, 2023.

“Despite the economic and market headwinds, we continued to make good progress on our strategic transformation
in Q4, including advancing our product roadmap and improving our operational structure and processes to drive
efficiencies while delivering at the low-end of our guided range,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “In 2023, we will
continue to navigate the short-term challenges while striving to meet our long-term commitments, including
delivering leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at-scale manufacturing and
supercharged by our incredible team.”

“In the fourth quarter, we took steps to right-size the organization and rationalize our investments, prioritizing the
areas where we can deliver the highest value for the long term,” said David Zinsner, Intel CFO. “These actions
underpin our cost-reduction targets of $3 billion in 2023, and set the stage to achieve $8 billion to $10 billion by the
end of 2025.”

Business Unit Summary

Intel previously announced several organizational changes to accelerate its execution and innovation by allowing it
to capture growth in both large traditional markets and high-growth emerging markets. This includes the
reorganization of Intel's business units to capture this growth and provide increased transparency, focus and
accountability. As a result, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2022 to align to the
previously announced business reorganization. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to
reflect the way the company internally manages and monitors operating segment performance starting in fiscal year
2022.

Business Highlights

▪

▪

▪

▪

Intel continues to make progress with its goal of achieving five nodes in four years and is on track to regain
transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Intel 7 is now in high-volume
manufacturing for both client and server. Intel 4 is manufacturing-ready, with the Meteor Lake ramp
expected in the second half of 2023. Intel 3 continues to progress and is on track. On Intel 20A and Intel
18A, Intel’s first internal test chips, and those of a major potential foundry customer, have taped out with
products undergoing fabrication.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, CCG’s 13th Gen Intel® Core™ desktop processor family became available,
starting with desktop “K” processors and the Intel® Z790 chipset. Additionally, in December 2022, in
partnership with ASUS, Intel officially set a new world record for overclocking, pushing the 13th Gen Intel
Core i9-13900K past the 9 gigahertz barrier for the first time ever.
In January 2023, DCAI launched its 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (formerly code-named
Sapphire Rapids) with the support of customers and partners such as Dell Technologies, Google Cloud,
Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA and many others, and is ramping production
to meet a strong backlog of demand.
NEX achieved a second consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth, hitting key product milestones
with Intel® IPU E2000 (Mount Evans), Raptor Lake P&S, Alder Lake N and Sapphire Rapids.

Note: 2021 non-GAAP results excludes the NAND memory business. Intel completed the first closing of the divestiture on December 29, 2021.

AXG delivered record revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year. In January 2023, AXG launched the
Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series (formerly code-named Sapphire Rapids HBM) and the Intel® Data Center
GPU Max Series (formerly code-named Ponte Vecchio). Intel also announced that with AXG’s flagship
products now in production, the company is evolving AXG’s structure to accelerate and scale its impact and
drive go-to-market strategies with a unified voice to customers. Accordingly, the consumer graphics teams
will join CCG, and the accelerated computing teams will join DCAI.
IFS achieved record revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year, with active design engagements with
seven of the 10 largest foundry customers. It also added a leading cloud, edge and data center solutions
provider as a customer to Intel 3.
Intel completed the IPO of Mobileye, which achieved record revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year
of 2022. Mobileye continued to execute well in its core advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)
business, as it launched systems into 233 distinct vehicle models in 2022.

Business Outlook

Intel's guidance for the first quarter of 2023 includes both GAAP and non-GAAP estimates. Reconciliations between
GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below.*

Q1 2023

Revenue
Gross margin
Tax rate
Earnings (loss) per share

Actual results may differ materially from Intel’s Business Outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors
described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below.

*Effective January 2023, Intel increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment
from five years to eight years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, Intel
expects total depreciation expense in 2023 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion, including an approximate $2.6 billion
increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses and a $1.2 billion decrease in 2023 ending
inventory values. Intel’s Q1 2023 outlook includes an estimated $350 million to $500 million benefit to operating
margin or $0.07 to $0.10 benefit to EPS from this change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to
operating expenses. The change in depreciable life will not be counted toward the $3 billion in cost savings in 2023
or the $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025 communicated at Q3 2022 earnings.

Earnings Webcast

Intel will hold a public webcast at 2 p.m. PST today to discuss the results for its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022.
The live public webcast can be accessed on Intel's Investor Relations website at www.intc.com. The corresponding
earnings presentation and webcast replay will also be available on the site.

statements included in this release are based on management's expectations as of the date of this release and,
except as required by law, Intel disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future
events or circumstances. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, the forward-looking statements in this release do
not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that have
not been completed as of the date of this release. Forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Intel
presently considers the following to be among the important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially
from the company's expectations.

▪ Demand for Intel's products is highly variable and can differ from expectations due to factors including
changes in business and economic conditions; customer confidence or income levels, and the levels of
customer capital spending; the introduction, availability, and market acceptance of Intel's products, products
used together with Intel products, and competitors' products; competitive and pricing pressures, including
actions taken by competitors; supply constraints and other disruptions affecting customers; changes in
customer order patterns or forecasts including order cancellations; changes in customer needs and
emerging technology trends; and changes in the level of inventory and computing capacity at customers.
Intel's results can vary significantly from expectations based on capacity utilization; variations in inventory
valuation, including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale; changes in revenue
levels; segment product mix; the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs;
excess or obsolete inventory; changes in unit costs; defects or disruptions in the supply of materials or
resources, including as a result of ongoing industry shortages of components and substrates; suppliers
extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to

▪

Intel/Page 5

other customers including competitors, delaying or canceling deliveries or increasing prices, or other supply
chain issues; product manufacturing quality/yields; and changes in capital requirements and investment
plans. Variations in results can also be caused by the timing of Intel product introductions and related
expenses, including marketing programs and Intel's ability to respond quickly to technological developments
and to introduce new products or incorporate new features into existing products, as well as decisions to
exit product lines or businesses, which have resulted and can result in restructuring and asset impairment
charges.
Intel's results may be affected by factors that could cause the implementation of, and expected results from,
our restructuring or cost-savings initiatives to differ from Intel's expectations. The expected cost savings
resulting from these initiatives may not be realized and are subject to risks related to the timing and amount
of related charges, local labor law requirements, and assumptions related to severance, post-retirement,
and other costs. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and
culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the
loss of historical, technical, and other expertise.
Intel's results can be affected by adverse economic, social, political, regulatory, and physical/infrastructure
conditions in countries where Intel, its customers, or its suppliers operate, including recession or slowing
growth, military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns
(including the COVID-19 pandemic), fluctuations in currency exchange rates, inflation, interest rate risks,
sanctions and tariffs, political disputes, changes in government grants and incentives, and continuing
uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad. Results
can also be affected by the formal or informal imposition by countries of new or revised export and/or import
and doing-business regulations, including changes or uncertainty related to the US government entity list
and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which can be changed without prior notice. For
example, in response to Russia’s war with Ukraine, numerous countries and organizations have imposed
financial and other sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus, while businesses, including
the company, have limited or suspended Russian operations. Russia has likewise imposed currency
restrictions and regulations and may further take retaliatory trade or other actions, including the
nationalization of foreign businesses.
The COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected significant portions of Intel's business and could
have a material adverse effect on Intel's financial condition and results of operations. The pandemic has
resulted in authorities imposing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, including manufacturing,
transportation, and operational restrictions or disruptions, such as the Shanghai port shutdowns. These
measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our
customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. Restrictions on our manufacturing
or support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, can impact our
ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on us. Restrictions or disruptions
of transportation, or disruptions in our customers’ operations and supply chains, may adversely affect our
results of operations. The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices. There is no certainty
that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce
disruptions could lead to unavailability of our key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions.
The pandemic has also previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted
historical patterns related to demand for our products and services. Demand for our products has been and
could again be materially harmed in the future, and our ability to accurately predict future demand, trends,
or other matters may be impacted. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future
developments, which are highly uncertain. The impact of the pandemic can also exacerbate other risks
discussed in this section.
Intel operates in highly competitive industries and its operations have high costs that are either fixed or
difficult to reduce in the short term. In addition, we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent
products, such as our intention to become a major provider of foundry services, and we face new sources of

▪

▪

▪

▪

Intel/Page 6

competition and uncertain market demand or acceptance of our offerings with respect to these new areas
and products, and they do not always grow as projected.
Intel's expected tax rate is based on current tax law, including current interpretations of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), and current expected income and can be affected by changes in interpretations of
TCJA and other laws, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022; changes in the volume and mix of profits
earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates; changes in the estimates of credits,
benefits, and deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities,
including payment of interest and penalties; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets.
Intel's results can be affected by gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other, which can
vary depending on gains or losses on the change in fair value, sale, exchange, or impairments of equity and
debt investments, interest rates, cash balances, and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.
Product defects or errata (deviations from published specifications) can adversely impact our expenses,
revenues, and reputation.

▪

▪

▪

▪ We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other

products as well as the operating systems and workloads running on them. Security vulnerabilities and any
limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of
operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any
of which may be material, including incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates
and mitigations, writing down inventory value, a reduction in the competitiveness of our products, defending
against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages,
addressing customer satisfaction considerations, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties.
Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers
or users and reduce demand for our products and services.

▪ Cybersecurity incidents, whether or not successful, can affect Intel's results by causing us to incur

▪

▪

significant costs or disrupting our operations or those of our customers and suppliers, and can result in
reputational harm.
Intel's results can be affected by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, stockholder,
consumer, chemicals, antitrust, commercial, disclosure, and other issues, as well as by the impact and
timing of settlements and dispute resolutions. For example, in the first quarter of 2022, the General Court in
the European Commission (EC) competition matter annulled the EC's findings against Intel regarding
rebates, as well as the fine previously imposed on and paid by Intel. $1.2 billion was returned to Intel in
February 2022, and the EC has appealed this decision to the Court of Justice.
Intel's results can be affected by the impact and timing of closing of acquisitions, divestitures, and other
significant transactions, such as the pending acquisition of Tower Semiconductor Inc. In addition, these
transactions do not always achieve our financial or strategic objectives and can disrupt our ongoing
business and adversely impact our results of operations. We may not realize the expected benefits of
portfolio decisions due to numerous risks, including unfavorable prices and terms; changes in market
conditions; changes in applicable laws; limitations due to regulatory or governmental approvals, contractual
terms, or other conditions; and potential continued financial obligations associated with such transactions.

Detailed information regarding these and other factors that could affect Intel's business and results is included in
Intel's SEC filings, including the company's most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, particularly the "Risk
Factors" sections of those reports. Copies of these filings may be obtained by visiting our Investor Relations website
at www.intc.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.

We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses and charges such as:

▪

▪

▪

▪

▪

historical results of operations from divested businesses;

results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives;

amounts included within restructuring and other charges;

employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges and other expenses not allocated to the operating
segments (beginning the first quarter of 2022, this includes all of our stock-based compensation); and

acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and
goodwill.

Intel Corporation
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the
non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful
supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results
between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater
transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus
plans.

Starting in the first quarter of 2022, we incrementally exclude from our non-GAAP results share-based
compensation and all gains and losses on equity investments. The adjustment for all gains and losses on equity
investments includes the ongoing mark-to-market adjustments previously excluded from our non-GAAP results.

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the
related income tax effects where applicable. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate
for each adjustment, as applicable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for,
or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in
accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Non-GAAP
adjustment or
measure

NAND memory
business

We completed the first closing of the divestiture of
our NAND memory business to SK hynix on
December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our
ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in
the first quarter of 2022.

Definition

Usefulness to management and investors

Acquisition-related
adjustments

Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets
consists of amortization of intangible assets such
as developed technology, brands, and customer
relationships acquired in connection with business
combinations. Charges related to the amortization
of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of
sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial
statements. Amortization charges are recorded
over the estimated useful life of the related
acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally
recorded over multiple years.

Share-based
compensation

Share-based compensation consists of charges
related to our employee equity incentive plans.

We exclude the impact of our NAND memory
business in certain non-GAAP measures. While the
second closing of the sale is still pending and subject
to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this business
in Q1 2022 and management does not view the
historical results of the business as a part of our core
operations. We believe these adjustments provide
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of
management, of our core business model and how
management currently evaluates core operational
performance. In making these adjustments, we have
not made any changes to our methods for measuring
and calculating revenue or other financial statement
amounts.
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-
related intangible assets for purposes of calculating
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges
are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted
by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our
current operating performance and comparison to our
past operating performance and provide investors with
additional means to evaluate cost and expense
trends.

We exclude charges related to share-based
compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-
GAAP measures because we believe these
adjustments provide better comparability to peer
company results and because these charges are not
viewed by management as part of our core operating
performance. We believe these adjustments provide
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of
management, of our core business model, how
management currently evaluates core operational
performance, and additional means to evaluate
expense trends, including in comparison to other peer
companies.

Definition

Usefulness to management and investors

Patent settlement A portion of the charge from our IP settlements

represents a catch-up of cumulative amortization
that would have been incurred for the right to use
the related patents in prior periods. This charge
related to prior periods is excluded from our non-
GAAP results; amortization related to the right to
use the patents in the current and ongoing periods
is included.

Optane inventory
impairment

Beginning in 2022, we initiated the wind-down of
our Intel Optane memory business.

Restructuring and
other charges

(Gains) losses on
equity
investments, net

Gains (losses)
from divestiture

Tax Reform

Adjusted free cash
flow

Restructuring charges are costs associated with a
formal restructuring plan and are primarily related
to employee severance and benefit arrangements.
Other charges include a benefit in Q1 2022 related
to the annulled EC fine, a charge in Q1 2021
related to the VLSI litigation, periodic goodwill and
asset impairments, certain pension charges, and
costs associated with restructuring activity.

(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists
of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on
marketable equity securities, observable price
adjustments on non-marketable equity securities,
related impairment charges, and the sale of equity
investments and other.

Gains (losses) are recognized at the close of a
divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when
deferred consideration is received at the time of
closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the
NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement
entered into in connection with the first closing of
the sale of our NAND memory business on
December 29, 2021, a portion of the initial closing
consideration was deferred and will be recognized
between first and second closing.
Adjustments for Tax Reform reflect the impact of a
change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to
the capitalization of R&D costs.

We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of
adjusted free cash flow, which is used by
management when assessing our sources of
liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings.
Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow
adjusted for 1) additions to property, plant and
equipment, net of proceeds from capital grants and
partner contributions, 2) payments on finance
leases, and 3) proceeds from the McAfee equity
sale.

We exclude the catch-up charge related to prior
periods for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP
measures because this adjustment facilitates
comparison to past operating results and provides a
useful evaluation of our current operating
performance.

We exclude these impairments for purposes of
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because
these charges do not reflect our current operating
performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful
evaluation of our current operating performance and
comparisons to past operating results.

We exclude restructuring and other charges, including
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods,
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP
measures because these costs do not reflect our core
operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a
useful evaluation of our core operating performance
and comparisons to past operating results and provide
investors with additional means to evaluate expense
trends.

We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures
because it provides better comparability between
periods. The exclusion reflects how management
evaluates the core operations of the business.

We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP
measures because they do not reflect our current
operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a
useful evaluation of our current operating performance
and comparisons to past operating results.

We exclude the impacts of this 2022 change in US tax
treatment of R&D costs for purposes of calculating
certain non-GAAP measures as we believe these
adjustments facilitate a better evaluation of our current
operating performance and comparison to past
operating results.

This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in
understanding our capital requirements and sources
of liquidity by providing an additional means to
evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since
the 2017 divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and
sales have contributed to operating and free cash
flow, and while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022
would typically be excluded from adjusted free cash
flow as an equity sale, we believe including the sale
proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better,
more consistent comparison to past presentations of
liquidity.

Intel Corporation
Supplemental Reconciliations of GAAP Outlook to Non-GAAP Outlook

Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable US GAAP
financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to,
financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial outlook prepared in accordance with
US GAAP and the reconciliations from this Business Outlook should be carefully evaluated.

Please refer to "Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures" in this document for a detailed explanation of the adjustments
made to the comparable US GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the
reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors.

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the items described above, as well
as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using the same fixed long-
term projected tax rate across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis
using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The
projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our expected tax structure, our tax positions in various
jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may
be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant
changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Prospectively, we
believe this approach will facilitate comparison of our operating results and provide useful evaluation of our current
operating performance. As described in our explanation of non-GAAP measures above, and consistent with the use
of our other non-GAAP adjustments, beginning in 2023 management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing

1 The impact of non-controlling interest to our non-GAAP adjustments in Q1 2023 is expected to be insignificant and thus is not included in our

non-GAAP tax rate.
