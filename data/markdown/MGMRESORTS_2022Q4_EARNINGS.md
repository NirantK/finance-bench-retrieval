Regional Operations

•  Share buybacks of $2.8 billion in 2022 and $352 million in 4Q22
•  New $2 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors

Las Vegas, Nevada, February 8, 2023 – MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) (“MGM Resorts”
or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022.

“We  achieved  our  fifth  consecutive  quarter  of  record-breaking  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  Adjusted
Property EBITDAR in the fourth quarter,” said Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President
of MGM Resorts. “What we accomplished in 2022 is nothing short of remarkable, and is a testament to
our strategic plan, scale, brand strength, talented team, loyalty program, and the diverse geographies and
channels in which we operate. We believe that there is strong momentum in our business and our 2023
outlook  remains  bright,  driven  by  a  robust  events  calendar  domestically, MGM  China’s  rapid  year-to-
date return to profitability and BetMGM's ongoing improvement in 2023.”

“We achieved exceptional results in the fourth quarter and remain optimistic in our outlook for this year.
We are also focused on free cash flow and believe our company presents a compelling yield, especially
when  taking  into  account  the  value  in  our  share  price  for  excess  cash,  our  ownership  value  of  MGM
China and BetMGM,” said Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of MGM Resorts.
“Our share buyback program continues to return capital to shareholders as we have already repurchased
4 million shares for $164 million year-to-date, adding to the 76 million shares we repurchased in 2022
and totaling approximately $4.7 billion since 2021. Beyond this, our Board of Directors authorized an
additional $2 billion for share buybacks.”

Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Highlights:

Consolidated Results

•  Consolidated net revenues of $3.6 billion, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year quarter.
The current quarter benefited from the inclusion of the operating results of The Cosmopolitan of
Las  Vegas  ("The  Cosmopolitan"),  which  was  acquired  in  May  2022,  partially  offset  by  the
disposition of The Mirage in December 2022. Additionally, results improved over the prior year
quarter due to an increase in business volume and travel activity primarily at the Las Vegas Strip
Resorts and Regional Operations;

•  Operating loss was $2 million compared to operating income of $369 million in the prior year
quarter due primarily to  a $1.2 billion increase in noncash amortization expense relating to the
MGM  Grand  Paradise  gaming  subconcession  and  an  increase  of  $338  million  of  rent  expense
recorded  within  general  &  administrative  expense  related  to  the  VICI  and  The  Cosmopolitan

leases, which commenced in April 2022 and May 2022, respectively, partially offset  by a $1.1
billion gain on the disposition of The Mirage in the current quarter;

•  Net  income  attributable  to  MGM  Resorts  of  $284  million,  which  was  impacted  by  the  items
affecting operating loss discussed above, compared to $131 million in the prior year quarter;
•  Diluted  earnings  per  share  of  $0.69  in  the  current  quarter  compared  to  $0.23  in  the  prior  year

quarter;

Las Vegas Strip Resorts

•  Net  revenues  of  $2.3  billion  in  the  current  quarter  compared  to  $1.8  billion  in  the  prior  year

Cosmopolitan and an increase in business volume and travel activity compared to the prior year
quarter, partially offset by the disposition of The Mirage;

quarter compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year quarter, an increase of 11%;

in the prior year quarter, an increase of 26%;

•  Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR(2) of $691 million in the current quarter compared to

$651 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 6%; and

•  Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin(2) of 38.2% in the current quarter compared to 38.7% in the
prior year quarter, a decrease of 50 basis points due primarily to an increase in contribution from
lower-margin non-gaming outlets and venues.

quarter, an increase of 10% due to an increase in business volume;

the prior year quarter, an increase of 3%; and

•  Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin of 32.2% in the current quarter compared to 34.4% in the
prior year quarter,  a decrease of  215  basis points  compared to  the prior  year quarter  due to  an
increase  in  contribution  from  lower-margin  non-gaming  outlets  and  venues  and  an  increase  in
general  and administrative expenses as  the prior year quarter included a benefit of $16  million
for insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Zeta.

MGM China

•  Net revenues of $175 million in the current quarter compared to $315 million in the prior year
quarter, a decrease of 44%. The current quarter was negatively affected by a three-day COVID-
19  related  property  closure  at  MGM  Cotai  and  was  more  significantly  impacted  by  travel  and
entry restrictions in Macau compared to the prior year quarter; and

impact  of  the  extension  of  the  exemption  from  the  Macau  12%  complementary  tax  and  a  non-cash
income  tax  benefit  of  $37  million  to  record  the  impact  of  the  VICI  transaction  on  state  deferred  tax
liabilities, partially offset by a non-cash income tax charge of $90 million resulting from an increase in
the valuation allowance on Macau deferred tax assets and a non-cash income tax charge of $59 million
to record the deferred tax impact of income tax regulations governing combined reporting in New Jersey
that were issued during the year.

1."Adjusted EPS" is diluted earnings or loss per share adjusted to exclude property transactions, net, preopening and start-up
expenses,  gain  on  REIT  transactions,  net,  gain  on  consolidation  of  CityCenter,  net,  foreign  currency  gain/loss  related  to
MGM China's U.S. dollar-denominated debt, net gain/loss related to equity investments for which the Company has elected
the  fair  value  option  of  ASC  825  and  equity  investments  accounted  for  under  ASC  321  for  which  there  is  a  readily
determinable fair value and net gain/loss related to the Company's debt securities, change in the fair value of foreign currency
contracts,  mark-to-market    adjustments    related    to    MGP's    unhedged    interest    rate    swaps,  mark-to-market  adjustments
related to CityCenter's unhedged interest rate swaps recorded within non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates, and
gain  related  to  CityCenter's  sale  of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates.

Adjusted  EPS  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  and  is  presented  solely  as  a  supplemental  disclosure  to  reported  GAAP  measures
because  management  believes  this  measure  is  useful  in  providing  period-to-period  comparisons  of  the  results  of  the
Company's  continuing  operations  to  assist  investors  in  reviewing  the  Company's  operating  performance  over  time.
Management  believes  that  while  certain  items  excluded  from Adjusted  EPS  may  be  recurring  in  nature  and  should  not  be
disregarded in evaluating the Company's earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when comparing current
performance  to  prior  periods  because  these  items  can  vary  significantly  depending  on  specific  underlying  transactions  or
events. Also, management believes certain excluded items, and items further discussed in footnote 2 below, may not relate
specifically  to  current  operating  trends  or  be  indicative  of  future  results.  Adjusted  EPS  should  not  be  construed  as  an
alternative to GAAP earnings per share as an indicator of the Company's performance. In addition, Adjusted EPS may not be
defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial
measures of other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to diluted earnings per share can be found under "Adjusted
Diluted Earnings Per Share" included in this release.

2."Adjusted  EBITDAR"  is  earnings  before  interest  and  other  non-operating  income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and
amortization,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses,  property  transactions,  net,  gain  on  REIT  transactions,  net,  gain  on
consolidation  of  CityCenter,  net,  rent  expense  related  to  triple-net  operating  leases  and  ground  leases,  gain  related  to
CityCenter's  sale  of  Harmon land  recorded  within  income from  unconsolidated  affiliates,  and  income  from  unconsolidated
affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.

"Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR"  is  the  Company's  reportable  segment  GAAP  measure,  which  management  utilizes  as  the
primary  profit  measure  for  its  reportable  segments  and  underlying  operating  segments. Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  is  a
measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization,
preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net
operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and
also  excludes  gain  on  consolidation  of  CityCenter,  net,  gain  related  to  CityCenter's  sale  of  Harmon  land  recorded  within
income from unconsolidated affiliates, corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each
operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation.

"Same-Store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR"  is  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  further  adjusted  to  exclude  the  Adjusted
Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and

Page 7 of 15

to  exclude  the  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  of  disposed  operating  segments  from  the  beginning  of  the  reporting  period
through  the  date  of  disposition.  Accordingly,  the  Company  has  excluded  the  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  of  The
Cosmopolitan  for  periods  subsequent  to  its  acquisition  on May  17,  2022, Aria for  periods  subsequent  to  its  acquisition  on
September 27, 2021, and The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition on December 19, 2022 in Same-Store Adjusted
Property EBITDAR for the periods indicated, as applicable.

Same-Store Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  and  is  presented  solely  as  a  supplemental disclosure  to
reported  GAAP  measures  because  management  believes  this  measure  is  useful  in  providing  meaningful  period-to-period
comparisons  of  the  results  of  the  Company's  operations  for  operating  segments  that  were  consolidated  for  the  full  period
presented  to  assist  users  of  the  financial  statements  in  reviewing  operating  performance  over  time.  Same-Store  Adjusted
Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered  in isolation, or as an
alternative  to  the  Company's  reportable  segment  GAAP  measure  or  net  income,  or  as  an  alternative  to  any  other  measure
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a  GAAP
basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may
not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP
financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of the Company's reportable
segment  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  GAAP  measure  to  Same-Store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  is  included  in  the
financial schedules in this release.

"Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR" and "Table Games Hold Adjusted Las
Vegas  Strip  Resorts  Same-Store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR"  are  supplemental  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  that,  in
addition  to  the  reasons  described  above  for  the  presentation  of  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  and  Same-Store  Adjusted
Property EBITDAR, are presented to adjust for the impact of certain variances in table games win percentages compared to
the mid-point of the expected ranges. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR and
Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR are calculated by applying a
win percentage of 30.0% for Baccarat and 21.0% for non-Baccarat games to the respective table games drops for the quarter,
which represents the mid-point of the expected ranges of 25.0% to 35.0% for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-Baccarat
at the Las Vegas Strip Resorts properties. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property
EBITDAR is Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR adjusted to exclude the hold adjustments related to such acquired and
disposed  operating  segments  for  the  respective  periods.  Table  Games  Hold  Adjusted  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  Adjusted
Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR are
also  adjusted  for  the  gaming  taxes,  bad  debt  expense,  discounts  and  other  incentives  that  would  have  been  incurred  or
avoided when applying the win percentages noted above to the respective gaming volumes. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las
Vegas  Strip  Resorts  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  and  Table  Games  Hold  Adjusted  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  Same-Store
Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or
as an alternative to the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or to any other measure determined in
accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  because  this  measure  is  not  presented  on  a  GAAP  basis,  and  is
provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted
Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may
not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP
financials measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of the Company's reportable
segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store
Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.

Adjusted  EBITDAR  information  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  that  is  a  valuation  metric,  should  not  be  used  as  an  operating
metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this
measure  is  widely  used  by  analysts,  lenders,  financial  institutions,  and  investors  as  a  principal  basis  for  the  valuation  of
gaming  companies.  Management  believes  that  while  items  excluded  from Adjusted  EBITDAR  may  be  recurring  in  nature
and should not be disregarded in evaluation of the Company's earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when
analyzing current results and trends. Also, management believes excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends
or  be  indicative  of  future  results.  For  example,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses  will  be  significantly  different  in  periods
when the Company is developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period
lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal
recurring  disposals,  gains  and  losses  on  sales  of  assets  related  to  specific  assets  within  the  Company's  resorts,  but  also

Page 8 of 15

includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset
groups  or  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  which  may  not  be  comparable  period  over  period.  In  addition,
management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding
rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial
institutions,  and  investors  when  valuing  the  Company,  as  well  as  comparing  the  Company's  results  to  other  gaming
companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming
companies  may  or  may  not  include  triple-net  operating  leases  or  ground  leases.  However,  as  discussed  herein,  Adjusted
EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of the Company's performance,
considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows
from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  because  this  measure  is  not  presented  on  a  GAAP  basis  and  excludes  certain
expenses, including the rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited
purposes  discussed  herein.  In  addition,  other  companies  in  the  gaming  and  hospitality  industries  that  report  Adjusted
EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. The Company has
significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground
lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR.

A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.

"Table  Games  Hold Adjusted  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  Net  Revenues"  and  "Table  Games  Hold Adjusted  Las  Vegas  Strip
Resorts  Same-Store  Net  Revenues"  are  additional  supplemental  non-GAAP  financial  measures  that  are  presented  to  adjust
Las Vegas Strip Resorts net revenues for the impact of certain variances in table games win percentages compared to the mid-
point  of  the  expected  ranges,  as  described  herein.  Table  Games  Hold  Adjusted  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  Same-Store  Net
Revenues  excludes  the  net  revenues  of  acquired  operating  segments  from  the  date  of  acquisition  through  the  end  of  the
reporting period and the net revenues of disposed operating segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the
date of disposition and also excludes the hold adjustment related to such acquired and disposed operating segments for the
respective periods. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Net Revenues and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las
Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Net Revenues are also adjusted for the discounts and other incentives that would have been
incurred  or  avoided  when  applying  the  win  percentages  described  herein  to  the  respective  gaming  volumes.  Management
believes Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Net Revenues and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip
Resorts  Same-Store  Net  Revenues  present  consistent  measures  in  providing  period-to-period  comparisons  and  are  useful
measures in assisting investors in evaluating the Company's operating performance, and that Table Games Hold Adjusted Las
Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Net Revenues is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results
of the Company's operations for operating segments that were consolidated by the Company for the full period presented to
assist investors in reviewing the Company's operating performance over time. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip
Resorts  Net  Revenues  and  Table  Games  Hold Adjusted  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  Same-Store  Net  Revenues  should  not  be
construed as alternatives to GAAP net revenues or to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to
similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. Reconciliations of
GAAP net revenues to Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Net Revenues and Table Games Hold Adjusted
Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Net Revenues are included in the financial schedules in this release.

uncertainties. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such

risks relating to international operations, permits, licenses, financings, approvals and other contingencies in connection with
