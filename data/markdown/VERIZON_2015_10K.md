PART I
Item 1.     Business

General

Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon, or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of
communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world,
we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable
network connectivity, security and control. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation, we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware.
We  began  doing  business  as  Verizon  on  June  30,  2000  following  our  merger  with  GTE  Corporation.  We  have  a  highly  diverse  workforce  of  approximately
177,700 employees.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000).

We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services.

Wireless

Wireless’ communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer,
business and government customers across the United States.

Wireline

Wireline’s  voice,  data  and  video  communications  products  and  enhanced  services  include  broadband  video  and  data,  corporate  networking
solutions,  data  center  and  cloud  services,  security  and  managed  network  services  and  local  and  long  distance  voice  services.  We  provide  these
products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and
around the world.

The following portions of the 2015 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners are incorporated into this report:

•   “Overview” on pages 10 through 13; and,

•   “Segment Results of Operations” on pages 19 through 24 and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 71 through 73.

Wireless

Background

Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
United States (U.S.). Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2015,
Verizon Wireless had 112.1 million retail connections and 2015 revenues of approximately $91.7 billion, representing approximately 70% of Verizon’s aggregate
revenues.

Verizon Wireless was formed as a joint venture in April 2000 by the combination of the U.S. wireless operations and interests of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc
(Vodafone). On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to
acquire  all  of  Vodafone’s  indirect  45%  interest  in  Verizon  Wireless  for  aggregate  consideration  of  approximately  $130  billion  (the  Wireless  Transaction).  We
completed  the  Wireless  Transaction  on  February  21,  2014  and,  as  a  result,  we  acquired  100%  ownership  of  Verizon  Wireless.  The  consideration  paid  was
primarily comprised of cash and Verizon common stock.

We have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) Evolution - Data Optimized (EV-DO) networks of
any  U.S.  wireless  service  provider.  Our  4G  LTE  network  is  available  to  over  98%  of  the  U.S.  population  in  more  than  500  markets  covering  approximately
312 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural
areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier’s network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and
Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum.

We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network. In 2015, we announced our commitment to developing and
deploying fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and
appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless technology.

Wireless Service and Product Offerings

Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and
services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis.

Wireless Services

We  offer  our  wireless  services  on  a  postpaid  and  prepaid  basis.  Retail  (non-wholesale)  postpaid  accounts  primarily  represent  retail  customers  with  Verizon
Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a
variety of connected devices. A postpaid retail connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed in advance a
monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears. Approximately 95% of our retail
connections  received  our  wireless  services  on  a  postpaid  basis  as  of  December  31,  2015.  Our  prepaid  service  enables  individuals  to  obtain  wireless  services
without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.

We offer various postpaid account service plans, including shared data plans, single connection plans and plans tailored to the needs of our business customers.
Our  shared  data  plans  feature  domestic  unlimited  voice  minutes,  unlimited  domestic  and  international  text,  video  and  picture  messaging,  cloud  storage  and  a
single data allowance that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a customer’s account. For an additional monthly access fee, our customers have the option of
sharing long distance and roaming minutes among their devices for calls from the United States to, and calls while within, Canada and Mexico. Shared data plans
also include our Mobile Hotspot service at no additional charge. This service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot via their smartphone that can
provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for small and large businesses.

Customers  on  our  fixed-term  service  plans  have  historically  paid  higher  fees  for  their  wireless  service  in  exchange  for  the  ability  to  purchase  their  wireless
devices at subsidized prices. Under the Verizon device payment program (formerly known as Verizon Edge), our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or
tablets at unsubsidized prices on an installment basis (a device installment plan). Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment
program or on a compatible device that they already own pay lower service fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service
plans.  Generally,  customers  entering  into  device  installment  agreements  on  or  after  June  1,  2015  are  required  to  repay  all  amounts  due  under  their  device
installment agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device. However, certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new
device after paying down the minimum percentage of their device installment plan and trading in their device.

In August 2015, we launched a simplified shared data plan, the Verizon Plan, that offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to
10 devices on a customer’s account. New customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our
device payment program or at full retail, or by using their own compatible device. In addition, our current customers have the option of either moving to the
Verizon Plan, subject to certain restrictions, or keeping their existing plan.

We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of our devices. Our messaging services enable our customers to send and
receive text, picture and video messages. In addition, access to the Internet is available on all of our smartphones and nearly all of our basic phones. We also offer
service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or
 and other dedicated
3G EV-DO modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, Jetpacks
devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection.

TM

Our customers can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and
other content. Our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their
corporate  intranets  and  e-mail  across  our  diverse  portfolio  of  wireless  devices.  Our  location-based  services  provide  our  customers  with  directions  to  their
destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers
to  access  data  services  and  the  Internet  on  all  of  our  smartphones  and  many  of  our  tablets  and  basic  phones  from  hundreds  of  international  destinations.  In
addition,  depending  upon  their  wireless  device’s  operating  system,  our  customers  have  access  to  more  than  one  million  applications  and  services  offered  by
Google  Inc.  (Google)  via  Google  Play,  Apple  Inc.  (Apple)  via  iTunes,  Microsoft  Inc.  (Microsoft)  via  its  Windows  Phone  operating  system  and  BlackBerry
Limited (BlackBerry) via its BlackBerry App World webstore.

Our customers can make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G
LTE Broadband Router with Voice service. We also offer LTE Internet (Installed), a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections
in their homes using our 4G LTE network.

In addition, we provide network access and, in some cases, enhanced value added services to support wireless connections for the Internet of Things (IoT). Our
IoT services support devices that are used by a variety of vertical market segments, including health monitoring, education, manufacturing, utilities, distribution
and consumer products. For example, companies purchase network access and, in some cases, enhanced services from us in order to connect with and monitor
equipment,  such  as  medical  devices  used  to  monitor  patients,  fleet  management  devices  used  to  monitor  company-operated  vehicles  and  utility  monitoring
devices used for smart grid applications. Other companies purchase network access from us to support devices that are included in a service they, in turn, sell to
end users. We also support telematics services for some of the largest automotive manufacturers. We expect that consumer use of IoT wireless connections, such
as telematics, home monitoring, health monitoring, energy management and utilities management, will increase as consumers integrate these devices into their
mobile lifestyle. (See “New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives.”)

Wireless Devices

We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices.

Smartphones and Basic Phones. All of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO high-speed data services and run on various
operating platforms, such as Apple iOS, Google Android, Windows Phone OS, and BlackBerry OS. Most of the basic phones we offer are 3G EV-DO-enabled
and have HTML-browsing capability.

Tablets  and  Other  Internet  Devices.  We  offer  tablets  from  multiple  manufacturers,  all  of  which  can  access  the  Internet  via  our  4G  LTE  network  or  a  Wi-Fi
connection. The tablets run primarily on the Apple iOS, Google Android or Microsoft Windows operating systems. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which
we refer to as Jetpacks that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the
Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the
use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO Mobile Broadband modules. During 2015, we continued to experience
strong customer demand for tablets and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase.

We purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from Apple, Motorola Mobility, Samsung, LG Electronics, BlackBerry and HTC.

A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the “intelligence” of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are
manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology. To support CDMA-1XRTT and EV-DO technologies (with and without 4G
LTE), most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on Qualcomm Incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets. In addition, there are a number
of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly.

Network

We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most
populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2015, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 312 million people in the U.S., including those in areas
served  by  our  LTE  in  Rural  America  partners.  We  currently  have  21  committed  program  participants  that  have  the  potential  to  provide  4G  LTE  coverage  to
approximately three million people and, to date, all participants have commenced 4G LTE operations on their networks.

The reliability of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success, and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for
their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that
will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage.

We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, and completions of
large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt
and  completed  without  being  dropped.  We  plan  to  continue  to  upgrade  our  network,  primarily  to  increase  its  capacity  and  density,  by  utilizing  small  cell
technology, in-building solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing AWS spectrum. We are also exploring strategic opportunities
to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses.

Our  network  includes  various  elements  of  redundancy  designed  to  enhance  the  reliability  of  our  service.  To  mitigate  the  impact  of  power  disruptions  on  our
operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every
switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a
fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in all critical locations.

In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless
service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to
our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated
at-will by either party upon several months’ notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material
adverse effect on our business.

Technology

Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance
for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technologies.

5

Table of Contents

In 2014, we commercially launched our mobile Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service known as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). Advanced Calling 1.0, a first
generation suite of services enabled by VoLTE, is now being used, in addition to CDMA technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers.

In 2015, we announced our commitment to developing and deploying 5G wireless technology. We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry
partners  to  develop  5G  requirements  and  standards  and  conduct  testing  to  accelerate  the  introduction  of  5G  technologies.  We  believe  that  5G  technology  will
provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology, lower latency and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of Internet-connected
devices grows. We plan to launch field technology trials in 2016.

Spectrum

The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on
portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum,
portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the
United States.

In  January  2015,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  completed  an  auction  of  65  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  AWS-3  band. We  participated  in  that
auction, and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses
in April 2015.

We  anticipate  we  will  need  additional  spectrum  to  meet  future  demand.  This  increasing  demand  is  driven  by  growth  in  customer  connections  and  usage  of
wireless broadband services, which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive. We can meet our future spectrum needs by
acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions
occur. The FCC will be auctioning television broadcast spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range through a voluntary incentive auction that will take place in
two phases. In the first phase, television broadcasters participating in the auction process will “sell” their rights to use such spectrum to the FCC. In the second
phase, the FCC will “resell” that spectrum to various auction participants, including wireless service providers and other potential bidders. The incentive auction
is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016.

Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, from time
to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar
opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, we have entered into intra-
market  spectrum  swaps  designed  to  increase  the  amount  of  contiguous  spectrum  within  frequency  bands  in  a  specific  market.  Contiguous  spectrum  improves
network performance and efficiency. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum
licenses in each instance.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions.

Network Equipment and Build-out

Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary
CDMA cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Alcatel-Lucent, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Nokia Solutions and
Networks (NSN) and Ericsson, which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely on Alcatel-Lucent, NSN and Ericsson for our
switching equipment. In January 2016, Nokia Corporation acquired Alcatel-Lucent and combined operations.

As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as
obtaining zoning, other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for macro cell sites. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-
building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown
Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation (American Tower), as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites.

During  March  2015,  we  completed  a  transaction  with  American  Tower  pursuant  to  which  American  Tower  acquired  the  exclusive  rights  to  lease  and  operate
approximately  11,300  of  our  wireless  towers  for  an  upfront  payment  of  $5.0  billion.  Under  the  terms  of  the  lease  agreements,  American  Tower  has  exclusive
rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to
acquire  these  towers  based  on  their  anticipated  fair  market  values  at  the  end  of  the  lease  terms.  As  part  of  this  transaction,  we  also  sold  162  towers  for  $0.1
billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew.

Marketing and Distribution

Our  marketing  strategy  is  focused  on  offering  solutions  tailored  to  the  needs  of  our  various  customer  market  groups;  promoting  our  brand;  leveraging  our
extensive  distribution  network;  and  jointly  marketing  our  products  and  services  to  large  business  and  government  customers  with  Verizon’s  Wireline  business
units through the Wireless Business Group, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless’ solutions for medium and large business
and  government  customers.  Our  marketing  plan  includes  a  coordinated  program  of  television,  print,  radio,  outdoor  signage,  Internet  and  point-of-sale  media
promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution
channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs.

6

Table of Contents

Company-operated  stores  are  a  core  component  of  our  distribution  strategy.  We  have  opened Verizon  Destination  Stores  in  various  major  metropolitan  areas,
which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. These stores are part of a broader
initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into “Smart Stores,” which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale. In
addition,  our  direct  channel  includes  our  business-to-business  sales  operations  and  systems  organization  and  is  focused  on  supporting  the  wireless
communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling
incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans.

Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as
through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with
us. We also utilize high-profile, national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores
such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. (AT&T), Sprint Corporation and
T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile USA), as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk
wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including those that buy from us. Competition is intense as a result of continuing
increases in wireless market penetration levels, network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of
new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may
also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers.

The  wireless  industry  also  faces  competition  from  other  communications  and  technology  companies  seeking  to  increase  their  brand  recognition  and  capture
customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft,
Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice
service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content.

We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry:

•   Network  reliability,  capacity  and  coverage.  We  believe  that  a  wireless  network  that  consistently  provides  high  quality  and  reliable  service  is  a  key
differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many
cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete
effectively,  wireless  service  providers  must  keep  pace  with  network  capacity  needs  and  offer  highly  reliable  national  coverage  through  their  networks.  We
believe that our investments in our 4G LTE network to increase network capacity will enable us to meet customer demand.

•   Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow,
wireless service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying
megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, unlimited data usage at competitive prices. Some wireless service providers also allow customers to rollover
unused data allowances to the next billing period. Furthermore, some wireless service providers offer price plans to new customers that undercut pricing under
the customer’s service plan with its current wireless provider, and some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offers with other products.
Some wireless providers also offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless.

Many wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and
blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device installment plans, which provide customers with the
ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans
whereby,  in  exchange  for  the  customer  entering  into  a  fixed-term  service  agreement,  the  wireless  service  providers  significantly,  and  in  some  cases  fully,
subsidized the customer’s device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers
on  device  installment  plans.  We  and  many  other  wireless  providers  have  limited  or  discontinued  the  use  of  device  subsidies.  As  a  result  of  the  increased
penetration  of  device  installment  plans,  we  expect  the  number  of  customers  on  plans  with  unsubsidized  service  pricing  to  continue  to  grow  in  2016.  We
compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price, while meeting
their wireless service needs.

•   Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other
wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and
services  and  focusing  on  their  needs  in  order  to  promote  long-term  relationships  and  minimize  churn.  Our  competitors  also  recognize  the  importance  of
customer service and are also focused on improving in this area. As part of our efforts to promote

7

long-term  relationships  with  our  customers,  we  offer  Verizon  Smart  Rewards,  which  is  a  program  that  offers  a  wide  variety  of  rewards  to  customers  in
exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related interactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts and savings
on merchandise from well-known brands, as well as discounts and other offers at local shopping and dining venues.

•   Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will
be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment
of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with
various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications
and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our
customer base.

•   Sales and distribution. Key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that
attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income.
We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing and web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities,
our  extensive  indirect  distribution  network  of  retail  outlets  and  prepaid  replenishment  locations,  and  through  manufacturers  of  laptops  and  netbooks  with
embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional
resellers,  which  resell  network  services  to  their  end-users,  and  to  various  companies  to  enable  wireless  communications  for  their  IoT  devices  or  for  their
provision of telematics services.

•   Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require

significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors.

Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as
new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of
competitors.

Wireline

Background

Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions,  data  center  and  cloud  services,  security  and  managed  network  services  and  local  and  long  distance  voice  services.  We  provide  these  products  and
services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. In 2015,
Wireline revenues were $37.7 billion, representing approximately 29% of Verizon’s aggregate revenues.

In  2014,  our  Wireline  segment  sold  a  non-strategic  business  that  provides  communications  solutions  to  a  variety  of  government  agencies.  Accordingly,  the
historical  Wireline  results  for  these  operations,  which  were  not  material  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  or  segment  results  of  operations,  have  been
reclassified to Corporate and other to reflect comparable segment operating results.

On February 5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which
Verizon will sell its local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched
and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5
billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction,
which includes the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does
not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizon’s continuing operations and
classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The transaction is subject
to  the  satisfaction  of  certain  closing  conditions  including,  among  others,  receipt  of  federal  approvals  from  the  FCC  and  the  antitrust  authorities  and  state
regulatory approvals. All federal and state regulatory approvals have been obtained. We expect this transaction to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016.

Based on the number of voice connections and Fios Internet and video subscribers, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, the transaction would result in Frontier
acquiring approximately 3.4 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses
from Verizon.

Wireline Service and Product Offerings

We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customers targeted by these offerings – mass markets, global enterprise and global wholesale.

Global Wholesale

Global Wholesale provides communications services, including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services, primarily to local, long distance, wireless, and
other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2015, Global Wholesale revenues were $6.0 billion, representing approximately 16%
of Wireline’s aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete
directly with us.

Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with Verizon’s other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions:

•   Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers’ networks and provide
connections to their end-users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as
well as core data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated
local exchange capacity to support their private networks.

New Ethernet connectivity in the U.S. represents the largest data growth opportunity in wholesale, as customers anticipate higher capacity demands in
the future. These customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing (TDM) to Ethernet, which will better scale and service the
growth  of  broadband  services  driven  by  smartphones,  mobile  broadband  and  mobile  video.  Global  Wholesale  offers  a  complete  suite  of  services  to
support the expansion of 4G and 3G networks.

Data services also include certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio,
including:

¡
   Managed services, which offer wholesale customers the opportunity to outsource the management of their networks, security, remote access, and

web applications to Verizon;

¡
   Mobility offerings,  which  enable  wholesale  customers  to  enhance  their  portfolio  to  triple-play  or  quad-play  capability  by  leveraging  wireless

devices and services offered through Verizon Wireless that can be packaged and resold under their own carrier brand; and

¡

Network

To provide services to our customers, we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world.

•

•

  Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 20.5 million premises in the U.S. as
of December 31, 2015. Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that
demand will continue to grow. The continued emergence of new video services, new data applications, and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will
continue  to  drive  new  network  requirements  for  increased  data  speeds  and  throughput.  We  believe  that  the  Passive  Optical  Network  (PON)  technology
underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost effective and efficient manner. Our PON technology provides the flexibility to
adapt  our  network  to  deliver  increased  data  speeds  and  new  services  without  major  overhauls  or  replacements  to  the  fiber  optic  infrastructure.  While
deployed  initially  as  a  consumer  broadband  network,  the  PON  infrastructure  is  finding  increased  application  in  the  enterprise  sector,  especially  as
businesses seek to migrate to Ethernet-based access services.

  Global IP. Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150
countries and 2,700 cities. Our global IP network includes long haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 800,000 route miles and enable and support
far reaching international operations.

Global  IP  volume  has  increased  significantly  over  the  last  five  years  and  substantial  year-over-year  growth  is  expected  to  continue.  We  deployed  the
industry’s first 100G ultra-long-haul-system for live traffic in 2009, and have made additional 100G deployments on our European and Asia-Pacific long-
haul networks, major U.S. backbone routes, and U.S. metro network. We have also completed a first office application of 200G technology on our U.S.
long-haul  network.  This  technology  allows  more  information  to  be  carried  on  a  single  wavelength  while  increasing  the  distance  it  can  be  sent  without
additional loss of signal quality.

Global business is rapidly evolving to an “everything-as-a-service” model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions
delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single,
high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that
can offer powerful solutions to these service demands.

We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology
deployments, will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers.

Competition

The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players
seeking  increased  market  share.  Current  and  potential  competitors  include  cable  companies,  wireless  service  providers,  other  domestic  and  foreign
telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise
solutions.

In  addition,  companies  with  a  global  presence  increasingly  compete  with  our  wireline  businesses.  A  relatively  small  number  of  telecommunications  and
integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with
these  full  or  near-full  service  providers  for  large  contracts  to  provide  integrated  services  to  global  enterprises.  Many  of  these  companies  have  strong  market
presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth.

We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry:

•   Bandwidth  (speed)  and  network  reliability:  Consumers  and  small  business  customers  are  seeking  to  leverage  high-speed  connections  for  entertainment,
communications  and  productivity.  As  online  and  online-enabled  activities  increase,  so  will  bandwidth  requirements,  both  downstream  and  upstream.  To
succeed,  we  and  other  network-based  providers  must  ensure  that  our  networks  can  meet  these  increasing  bandwidth  requirements.  In  addition,  network
reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet
growing bandwidth demand and provide the most reliable and secure network.

•   Pricing: Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also
a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and
portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.

•   Customer service: Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area
is important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global
Enterprise,  we  provide  our  customers  with  ready  access  to  their  system  and  performance  information,  and  we  conduct  proactive  testing  of  our  network  to
identify issues before they affect customers. In the Global Wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system
automation initiatives.

11

Table of Contents

•   Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from
access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline
functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.

•   Innovation: The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review,

improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer.

In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks so that they can
offer  digital  products  and  services.  We  continue  to  market  competitive  bundled  offerings  that  include  high-speed  Internet  access,  digital  television  and  voice
services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.

We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility
and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP
services as well as Internet portal providers. In addition, customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content
can be accessed on a TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone.

In the global enterprise market, the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is
driving the expansion  of  the  competitive  landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the
biggest companies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in
technology  spending.  Many  new  alliances  and  acquisitions  have  focused  on  emerging  fields  such  as  cloud  computing,  software  delivery,  communication
applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into
enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers.

Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for
wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity.

We also compete with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to CLECs at
significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers.

New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives

Technology  developments,  interconnected  markets,  shifting  consumer  needs  and  converging  industry  ecosystems  are  creating  innovative  opportunities  for
Verizon. We are transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and
need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through
global platforms in video and IoT and create certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental monetization. To execute this strategy, we have
created an organization devoted to the development of new products and incubation of new businesses. This organization is focused on leveraging all of our assets
to create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their wireless and wireline needs. Several strategic
initiatives have been undertaken by this organization in the following areas:

•   Digital  Media  and  Interactive  Entertainment.  Verizon  has  been  investing  in  emerging  technology  that  taps  into  the  market  shift  to  digital  content  and
advertising. On June 23, 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL). AOL is a leader in digital content and advertising. AOL’s business model
aligns with our approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability
to further develop future revenue streams.

We  believe  the  growth  in  video  consumption  using  mobile  devices  provides  us  with  an  opportunity  for  revenue  growth.  We  have  made  investments  in
converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content
models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. For example,
in 2015 we launched go90, a mobile-first social entertainment platform that provides the opportunity for ad-supported mobile video streaming. Digital content
available on the go90 platform includes live events, popular web and television content as well as original content. In January 2016, we introduced FreeBee
Data, a sponsored data service that enables content providers to provide our customers with access to some or all of the provider’s mobile content, or sponsor
specific consumer actions on a per-click basis, all free of data charges to the customer. In February 2016, we announced we would offer retail postpaid Verizon
Wireless customers video streaming in go90 over our 4G LTE network free of data charges via the FreeBee Data 360 sponsored data service. Customers must
have the latest version of the go90 application to take advantage of this offer.

We also began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service, which we used to deliver live events in go90
in 2015. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually
no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. In order to continue to meet the changing needs of our customers, we also are developing
an IP television service. We also believe it is important to have rights to deliver content over a wireless network that does not require an authentication back to
a subscription agreement. For example, our NFL agreement allows our customers to access certain games live on our 4G LTE network without authenticating
back to any subscription.

12

Table of Contents

We continue to invest in Verizon Digital Media Services, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand,
games, software and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content,
there  is  an  increasing  need  for  a  stable,  high-quality  video  delivery  platform.  We  are  focused  on  providing  a  simple,  end-to-end,  global  platform  for  the
delivery  of  media  to  customers,  which  we  believe  will  be  superior  to  that  offered  by  the  existing  and  highly  fragmented  media  delivery  ecosystem.  This
platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies as well as businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the Internet.
We also expect, through this platform, to further integrate our Fios and wireless offerings.

Connected  devices  and  associated  online  applications  continue  to  experience  significant  growth  as  customers  are  increasingly  consuming  large  amounts  of
broadband data, and we expect broadband usage to continue to increase. Our Fios network positions us in the industry with leading broadband speeds and
reliability. Broadband represents a growth opportunity for us as the use of over-the-top video and user generated content and data accelerates and the number
of connected homes and devices continues to grow.

•   Internet of Things and Telematics. The adoption of IoT technology continues to increase, primarily led by the telematics and transportation industries, as well
as the fields of utility and energy management. Our strategy to simplify the IoT and accelerate its adoption includes the launch in 2015 of ThingSpace, our new
IoT platform designed to assist developers create, test, manage and market their IoT-based solutions aimed at major vertical markets, such as energy, health
care and connected cities. ThingSpace comes with a portal that includes immediate access to dedicated application programming interfaces as well as partner
development kits.

Through Verizon Telematics, we provide connectivity and telematics to manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and help businesses manage large vehicle fleets
more efficiently. Our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content services and call centers. Our
platform  enables  factory  and  aftermarket-installed  automotive  safety  and  security  features  as  well  as  location-based  services  and  vehicle  diagnostics.  We
provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States, China and Europe. Our Networkfleet solution provides commercial fleet managers
throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety. We also
provide this service to over 28,900 vehicles operated by Verizon. We are further expanding our telematics portfolio to add asset tracking capabilities.

During the third quarter of 2015, we announced the availability of Hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service, to consumers. With this
subscription-based service, drivers will have diagnostic technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and will be able to request roadside assistance
with GPS accuracy when needed. Hum also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions.

•   Fostering Effective Partnerships and Alliances. As a market leader in offering differentiated solutions to our connected customers across all their devices at
home, at work and on the go, Verizon will continue to focus on strategic partnerships as an important pillar of our future strategy. Strategic partnerships are
aimed  at  complementing  and  augmenting  our  strengths,  expanding  our  addressable  market,  accelerating  our  pace  of  innovation,  enabling  faster  delivery  of
solutions such as media, IoT and cloud to the marketplace and, where possible, lowering our market and execution risk. Strong partnerships are expected to
further  our  efforts  to  offer  comprehensive  solutions  for  our  customers.  We  look  to  formulate  strategic  partnerships  and  alliances  with  a  global  orientation,
which will benefit us in terms of technology sourcing, content acquisition, consumer insights, and application ecosystems.

We  believe  these  investments  will  assist  us  in  bringing  innovative  next  generation  products  and  services  to  market  and  uncovering  new  sources  of  revenue,
increasing revenue from existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

Verizon owns or has licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business.
We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within
the United States and abroad. Verizon also actively grants licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards
and restrictions, to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain Verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their
products and services. Such licenses enable such third-party licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizon’s research and development efforts. While these
licenses  result  in  valuable  consideration  being  paid  to  Verizon,  we  do  not  believe  that  loss  of  such  consideration,  or  the  expiration  of  any  of  our  intellectual
property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations.

Verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or
other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights.
These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require
us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services.

Regulatory and Competitive Trends

Regulatory and Competitive Landscape

Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other
wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional
companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying
competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services
offered  by  Verizon,  the  FCC  is  our  primary  regulator.  The  FCC  has  jurisdiction  over  interstate  telecommunications  services  and  other  matters  under  the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.

FCC Regulation

Wireless Services

The FCC regulates several aspects of Verizon’s wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition, and transfer
of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC
oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. It can meet spectrum needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum
from  others,  or  by  participating  in  a  competitive  bidding  process  to  acquire  new  spectrum  from  the  FCC.  Those  processes  are  subject  to  certain  reviews,
approvals, and potential conditions.

Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data
services.  FCC  spectrum  licenses  typically  have  a  term  of  10  years,  at  which  time  they  are  subject  to  renewal.  While  the  FCC  has  routinely  renewed  all  of
Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide
services  on  the  spectrum  covered  by  that  license.  Some  of  our  licenses  require  us  to  comply  with  so-called  “open  access”  FCC  regulations,  which  generally
require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has
also  imposed  certain  specific  mandates  on  wireless  carriers  including  construction  and  geographic  coverage  requirements,  technical  operating  standards,
provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations, and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities.

Broadband

Verizon  offers  many  different  broadband  services.  Traditionally,  the  FCC  has  recognized  that  broadband  Internet  access  services  are  “information  services”
subject to a “light touch” regulatory approach rather than the traditional, utilities-style regulations that apply to traditional voice services. In its order imposing so-
called  “network  neutrality”  rules,  the  FCC  reversed  course  in  2015  and  declared  that  broadband  Internet  access  services  will  now  be  treated  as
“telecommunications  services”  subject  to  common  carriage  regulation  under  Title  II  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934.  This  decision  creates  uncertainty
concerning  the  level  of  regulation  that  will  apply  to  broadband  services  going  forward.  These  regulations  will  limit  the  ways  that  broadband  Internet  access
service providers can structure business arrangements and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions, including rate regulation, which could
adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. The FCC’s decision is being challenged in court, and the proper scope of such regulations is also being
debated  in  Congress.  Verizon  remains  committed  to  the  open  Internet  which  provides  consumers  with  competitive  choices  and  unblocked  access  to  lawful
found  on  our  website  at
websites  and  content  when,  where,  and  how
http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment.  Verizon  opposes  the  shift  to  utilities  style  regulation,  however,  which  we  believe  is  unnecessary,
unlawful and harmful to the broader Internet ecosystem and our customers.

they  want,  and  our  commitment

to  our  customers  can  be

Wireline Voice

Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on newer technologies such as VoIP. For
regulatory  purposes,  legacy  telephone  services  are  generally  considered  to  be  “common  carrier”  services.  Common  carrier  services  are  subject  to  heightened
regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions, and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP
but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.

Video

Verizon offers a multi-channel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these
rules  also  generally  apply  to  Verizon.  In  addition,  the  Act  generally  requires  companies  to  obtain  a  local  cable  franchise,  and  the  FCC  has  adopted  rules  that
interpret and implement this requirement. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to
obtain a franchise from local authorities.

Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access

The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks
and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. In many instances, Verizon makes payments to other providers, and in turn Verizon receives some
payments from other carriers. In 2011, the FCC issued a broad reform order changing, among other things, the framework for many of the per-minute rates that
carriers charge each other for the exchange of voice traffic. The new rules gradually reduce many of these rates to zero. The FCC also regulates some of the rates
and terms and conditions for certain wireline “special access” and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services. For
example, on the wireline side Verizon sells wholesale circuits to other voice and data service providers. On the wireless side, Verizon purchases special access and
other services to transport traffic to and from cell towers. In addition, as required by the Act, Verizon unbundles certain wireline network elements and makes
these facilities and services available to other network providers.

Universal Service

The Communications Act charges the FCC with ensuring that certain groups and areas have access to communications services, including rural and other high-
cost areas, low income subscribers, schools and libraries, rural health-care organizations, and deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The FCC established different
subsidy  and  discount  programs  to  achieve  these  goals.  To  pay  for  these  programs,  the  FCC  requires  contributions  from  providers  such  as  Verizon  based  on
reported revenues for certain services. Verizon also receives some payments from some of these programs but is a net payer into them.

State Regulation and Local Regulation

Wireless Services

The Communications Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does
not prohibit states from regulating the other “terms and conditions” of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing
matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving)
and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals
for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.

Wireline Services

State  public  utility  commissions  regulate  Verizon’s  telephone  operations  with  respect  to  certain  telecommunications  intrastate  matters.  Verizon  operates  as  an
“incumbent local exchange carrier” in 13 states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and
other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many
states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and to comply with certain
one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.

Environmental Matters

Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include
funds  to  address  contamination  at  the  site  of  a  former  Sylvania  facility  in  Hicksville,  NY,  which  had  processed  nuclear  fuel  rods  in  the  1950s  and  1960s.  In
September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken
primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to
the past and future expenses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites
requiring remediation.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The following discussion of “Risk Factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future
performance. This information should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations”
and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are
important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical
results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements.

Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations.

Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and
demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of
our  products,  electing  to  use  fewer  higher  margin  services  or  obtaining  lower-cost  products  and  services  offered  by  other  companies.  Similarly,  under  these
conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In
addition,  adverse  economic  conditions  may  lead  to  an  increased  number  of  our  consumer  and  business  customers  that  are  unable  to  pay  for  services.  If  these
events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We face significant competition that may reduce our profits.

We  face  significant  competition  in  our  industry.  The  rapid  development  of  new  technologies,  services  and  products  has  eliminated  many  of  the  traditional
distinctions  among  wireless,  cable,  Internet,  local  and  long  distance  communication  services  and  brought  new  competitors  to  our  markets,  including  other
telephone  companies,  cable  companies,  wireless  service  providers,  satellite  providers,  application  and  device  providers  and  providers  of  VoIP  services.  While
these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive
offerings.  In  addition,  wireless  service  providers  are  significantly  altering  the  financial  relationships  with  their  customers  through  commercial  offers  that  vary
service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to
compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our
customer  service,  our  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products  and  services,  the  reach  and  quality  of  our  sales  and  distribution  channels  and  our  capital
resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business
models,  changes  in  consumer  preferences  and  demand  for  existing  services,  demographic  trends  and  economic  conditions.  If  we  are  not  able  to  respond
successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.

If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline
in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits.

Our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow
new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing
offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a
timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of
new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. If our services fail to gain acceptance in
the  marketplace,  or  if  costs  associated  with  implementation  and  completion  of  the  introduction  of  these  services  materially  increase,  our  ability  to  retain  and
attract customers could be adversely affected.

In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a
cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.

We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.

We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network
equipment and handsets, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our handset and other device suppliers
often  rely  on  one  vendor  for  the  manufacture  and  supply  of  critical  components,  such  as  chipsets,  used  in  their  devices.  If  these  suppliers  or  vendors  fail  to
provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when
requested by our customers. We also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the costs and time lags that can be associated
with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services
of  one  or  more  major  suppliers  with  products  or  services  from  another  source,  especially  if  the  replacement  became  necessary  on  short  notice.  Any  such
disruption  could  increase  our  costs,  decrease  our  operating  efficiencies  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial
condition.

The  suppliers  and  vendors  on  which  we  rely  may  also  be  subject  to  litigation  with  respect  to  technology  on  which  we  depend,  including  litigation  involving
claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by
any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.

Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.

Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various
foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and
to  provide  specified  products  or  services.  We  are  frequently  required  to  maintain  licenses  for  our  operations  and  conduct  our  operations  in  accordance  with
prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is
impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or
state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and
services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing
licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of
our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we
manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a
manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. For example, in its order imposing so-called “network neutrality” regulations, the FCC reversed course
in 2015 on the longstanding “light touch” approach and “reclassified” broadband Internet access services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style
common carriage regulation. While the full scope and effect of this new regulatory approach is uncertain, these rules limit the ways that a broadband Internet
access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network and open the door to additional restrictions, including rate regulation that
could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. These rules are being challenged in the courts and the proper scope of such regulations is being
debated in Congress, but the outcome and timing of those challenges and debates remain uncertain. As another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that
require us to comply with so-called “open access” FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices
and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which
could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any
related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our
networks.

Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.

Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting and other means for obtaining
unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an
adverse  effect  on  our  business.  Cyber  attacks  may  cause  equipment  failures,  loss  of  information,  including  sensitive  personal  information  of  customers  or
employees  or  valuable  technical  and  marketing  information,  as  well  as  disruptions  to  our  or  our  customers’  operations.  Cyber  attacks  against  companies,
including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular
groups  or  persons.  These  attacks  may  be  committed  by  company  employees  or  external  actors  operating  in  any  geography,  including  jurisdictions  where  law
enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. While, to date, we
have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions
we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of
a major cyber attack in the future.

The inability to operate our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited
period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major
cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on
cyber  security  measures  and  the  use  of  alternate  resources,  lost  revenues  from  business  interruption  and  litigation.  The  potential  costs  associated  with  these
attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and
cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a
cyber  attack.  In  addition,  if  we  fail  to  prevent  the  theft  of  valuable  information  such  as  financial  data,  sensitive  information  about  Verizon  and  intellectual
property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against cyber attacks, it could result in lawsuits, government claims,
investigations or proceedings, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could
result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.

Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such
events  could  cause  significant  damage  to  our  infrastructure  upon  which  our  business  operations  rely,  resulting  in  degradation  or  disruption  of  service  to  our
customers.  While  we  maintain  insurance  coverage  for  some  of  these  events,  the  potential  liabilities  associated  with  these  events  could  exceed  the  insurance
coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.
These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the

18

Table of Contents

equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical
damage  could  cause  us  to  experience  substantial  losses  resulting  in  significant  recovery  time  and  expenditures  to  resume  operations.  In  addition,  these
occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.

Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt.

As  of  December  31,  2015,  Verizon  had  approximately  $110.2  billion  of  outstanding  indebtedness,  as  well  as  approximately  $7.9  billion  of  unused  borrowing
capacity under its existing credit facility. Verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:

•

•

•

•

•

  requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and
the  preferred  stock  issued  by  an  entity  acquired  from  Vodafone,  which  would  reduce  the  funds  Verizon  has  available  for  other  purposes,  such  as
working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;

  making  it  more  difficult  or  expensive  for  Verizon  to  obtain  any  necessary  future  financing  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  debt  service

requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;

  reducing Verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions;

  making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and

  exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates.

In addition, the term loan agreement Verizon entered into in connection with the Wireless Transaction requires Verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless
Verizon’s credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit Verizon’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future.

Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing.

We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit
markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to
obtain  financing  for  our  operations  or  refinance  existing  indebtedness.  In  addition,  our  borrowing  costs  can  be  affected  by  short-  and  long-term  debt  ratings
assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these
ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets
could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing.

Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.

With approximately 177,700 employees and approximately 203,000 retirees as of December 31, 2015 eligible to participate in Verizon’s benefit plans, the costs of
pension  benefits  and  active  and  retiree  healthcare  benefits  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  profitability.  Our  costs  of  maintaining  these  plans,  and  the  future
funding  requirements  for  these  plans,  are  affected  by  several  factors,  including  the  continuing  implementation  of  the  provisions  of  the  Patient  Protection  and
Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by
our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses.
If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.

A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the
renegotiation of our labor contracts.

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 25% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. Labor contracts covering approximately 36,300 employees of
our wireline business expired on August 1, 2015. We continue to be engaged in negotiations with our unions regarding new contracts. During the course of these
negotiations  we  could  experience  lengthy  work  stoppages,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business  operations,  including  a  loss  of  revenue  and  strained
relationships with customers. We cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage. Depending on the outcome of the negotiations, we may incur additional
costs. In addition, while less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses are represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success
unions may have in organizing these workforces or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs.

We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.

We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions,
wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In

19

Table of Contents

addition,  our  wireless  business  also  faces  personal  injury  and  consumer  class  action  lawsuits  relating  to  alleged  health  effects  of  wireless  phones  or  radio
frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless
phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.

costs. We also maintain facilities throughout the United States comprised of administrative and sales offices, customer care centers, retail sales locations, garage
work  centers,  switching  centers,  cell  sites  and  data  centers.  Furniture  and  other  consists  of  telephone  equipment,  furniture,  data  processing  equipment,  office
equipment, motor vehicles, plant under construction and leasehold improvements. A portion of our property is subject to the liens of their respective mortgages
securing funded debt.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

In October 2013, the California Attorney General’s Office notified Verizon California Inc. and other Verizon companies of potential violations of California state
hazardous  waste  statutes  primarily  arising  from  the  disposal  of  electronic  components,  batteries  and  aerosol  cans  at  certain  California  facilities.  We  are
cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged
violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

None.

In March 2014, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a three-year share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company’s common
stock. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule
10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Company’s
capital allocation priorities.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon common stock. At December 31, 2015, the maximum number of shares that
could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 97.2 million.

In February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of
the Company’s common stock. On February 10, 2015, Verizon received an initial delivery of 86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion.
On June 5, 2015, the ASR agreement was settled and an additional 15.4 million shares were delivered to Verizon and retired. In total, 101.6 million shares were
delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating
to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for
effective  internal  control  established  in  Internal  Control–Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015.

In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that
are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. We are also continuing an initiative to standardize and centralize transaction-processing activities
within our accounting processes, which we expect to continue over the next several years. These initiatives will incorporate certain changes in personnel as well.
In connection with these initiatives and the resulting changes in our financial systems and transaction-processing activities, the Company continues to review the
design  and  documentation  of  our  internal  control  system  and  to  enhance  our  processes  as  needed  to  ensure  that  controls  over  our  financial  reporting  remain
effective.

Except as noted above, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Verizon’s independent registered public accounting firm are included
in the 2015 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners on pages 36 and 37 and are incorporated herein by reference.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of
communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world,
we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our wireless and wireline networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable
network  connectivity,  security  and  control.  We  have  two  reportable  segments,  Wireless  and  Wireline.  Our  wireless  business,  operating  as  Verizon  Wireless,
provides voice and data services and equipment sales across the United States (U.S.) using one of the most extensive and reliable wireless networks. Our wireline
business  provides  consumer,  business  and  government  customers  with  communications  products  and  enhanced  services,  including  broadband  data  and  video,
corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services, and also owns
and  operates  one  of  the  most  expansive  end-to-end  global  Internet  Protocol  (IP)  networks.  We  have  a  highly  skilled,  diverse  and  dedicated  workforce  of
approximately 177,700 employees as of December 31, 2015.

To compete effectively in today’s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of
future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the
markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in video and Internet of Things (IoT) and create certain opportunities in applications
and  content  for  incremental  monetization.  Our  strategy  requires  significant  capital  investments  primarily  to  acquire  wireless  spectrum,  put  the  spectrum  into
service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber optic network that supports our businesses, maintain our networks and develop
and  maintain  significant  advanced  information  technology  systems  and  data  system  capabilities.  We  believe  that  steady  and  consistent  investments  in  our
networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. Our network leadership will continue to be the hallmark of our brand,
and provide the fundamental strength at the connectivity, platform and solutions layers upon which we build our competitive advantage.

Strategic Transactions

Spectrum Auction

In January 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the Advanced Wireless Services (AWS)-3
band. We participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted
us these spectrum licenses in April 2015.

Acquisition of AOL Inc.

On May 12, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender
offer  to  acquire  all  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock  of  AOL  at  a  price  of  $50.00  per  share,  net  to  the  seller  in  cash,  without  interest  and  less  any
applicable  withholding  taxes.  On  June  23,  2015,  we  completed  the  tender  offer  and  merger,  and  AOL  became  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Verizon.  The
aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares
exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. If they had not exercised these rights, Verizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at the
closing.

AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital
content and advertising. AOL’s business model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a
digital  advertising  platform  enhances  our  ability  to  further  develop  future  revenue  streams.  See  Note  2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional
information.

Access Line Sale

On February 5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which
Verizon will sell its local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched
and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5
billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction,
which includes the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does
not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizon’s continuing operations and
classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The transaction is subject
to  the  satisfaction  of  certain  closing  conditions  including,  among  others,  receipt  of  federal  approvals  from  the  FCC  and  the  antitrust  authorities  and  state
regulatory approvals. All federal and state regulatory approvals have been obtained. We expect this transaction to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016.

Based on the number of voice connections and Fios Internet and video subscribers, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, the transaction will result in Frontier
acquiring approximately 3.4 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses
from Verizon.

Tower Monetization Transaction

During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive
rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion (the Tower Monetization Transaction). Under the
terms of the leases, American Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate the towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire,
American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this
transaction, we sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market
rates, with options to renew. We have accounted for the upfront payment as deferred rent and as a financing obligation.

Wireless Transaction

On February 21, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc’s (Vodafone) indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless for
aggregate  consideration  of  approximately  $130  billion  (the  Wireless  Transaction).  The  consideration  paid  was  primarily  comprised  of  cash  of  approximately
$58.89 billion and Verizon common stock with a value of approximately $61.3 billion. With full control of Verizon Wireless enhancing our operational efficiency,
we  believe  we  are  well-positioned  to  meet  the  challenges  of  an  increasingly  competitive  industry.  See  Note  2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for
additional information.

Business Overview

Wireless

In our Wireless business, revenues grew 4.6% during 2015 driven by a 54.4% increase in equipment revenue as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily
smartphones, under the Verizon device payment program (formerly known as Verizon Edge), partially offset by a decline in device sales under our traditional
fixed-term  service  plans.  Customers  on  our  fixed-term  service  plans  have  historically  paid  higher  fees  for  their  wireless  service  in  exchange  for  the  ability  to
purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at
unsubsidized prices on an installment basis (a device installment plan). Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program
or on a compatible device that they already own pay lower service fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans.
The increase in activations of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program has resulted in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to
equipment  revenue  and  caused  a  change  in  the  timing  of  the  recognition  of  revenue.  This  shift  in  revenue  was  the  result  of  recognizing  a  higher  amount  of
equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the device payment program. For the year ended December 31, 2015, phone activations under the Verizon
device  payment  program  represented  approximately  54%  of  retail  postpaid  phones  activated  compared  to  approximately  18%  during  2014.  During  the  fourth
quarter  of  2015,  phone  activations  under  the  Verizon  device  payment  program  represented  approximately  67%  of  retail  postpaid  phones  activated.  At
December 31, 2015, approximately 29% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment program compared to approximately
8%  at  December  31,  2014.  At  December  31,  2015,  approximately  42%  of  our  retail  postpaid  phone  connections  were  on  unsubsidized  service  pricing.  At
December 31, 2015, retail postpaid connections were 4.4% higher than at December 31, 2014, with smartphones representing 84% of our retail postpaid phone
base at December 31, 2015 compared to 79% at December 31, 2014.

In August 2015, we launched a simplified shared data plan, the Verizon Plan, that offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to
10 devices on a customer’s account. New customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our
device payment program or at full retail, or by using their own compatible device. In addition, our current customers have the option of either moving to the
Verizon Plan, subject to certain restrictions, or keeping their existing plan.

We  are  focusing  our  wireless  capital  spending  on  adding  capacity  and  density  to  our  fourth  generation  (4G)  Long  Term  Evolution  (LTE)  network,  which  is
available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 312 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in
Rural America partners. Approximately 91% of our total data traffic in December 2015 was carried on our 4G LTE network. We are investing in the densification
of  our  network  by  utilizing  small  cell  technology,  in-building  solutions  and  distributed  antenna  solutions.  Densification  enables  us  to  add  capacity  to  manage
mobile video consumption and demand for IoT, as well as position us for future fifth-generation (5G) technology. In 2015, we announced our commitment to
developing and deploying 5G wireless technology. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and
appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless technology.

Wireline

In our Wireline business, revenues declined 1.8% during 2015 primarily due to revenue declines in Global Enterprise resulting from lower voice services and data
networking revenues, as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional voice service, we continue
to  build  our  Wireline  segment  around  data,  video  and  advanced  business  services  –  areas  where  demand  for  reliable  high-speed  connections  is  growing.  The
decrease in revenues in our Wireline segment was partially offset by revenue increases in Consumer retail driven by Fios. During the year ended December 31,
2015, Fios represented approximately 79% of Consumer retail revenue compared to approximately 76% in 2014. As the penetration of Fios products increases,
we continue to seek ways to increase revenue and further realize operating and capital efficiencies as well as maximize profitability. As more applications are
developed for this high-speed service, we expect that Fios will become a hub for managing multiple home services that will eventually be part of the digital grid,
including not just entertainment and communications, but also IoT technology used to support wireless communications in areas such as home monitoring, health
monitoring, energy management and utilities management.

We continue to develop offerings on our Fios platform. During 2015, Verizon announced the introduction of Fios Custom TV, which offers customers the option
of purchasing a package of channels that includes a base set of select national networks and local broadcast stations plus their choice of two sets of channels
grouped  into  various  content  categories,  such  as  news,  sports  and  entertainment.  Customers  can  add  more  sets  of  categorized  channels  to  their  Custom  TV
package for an additional monthly fee. As with all Fios TV packages, Custom TV customers also receive the Fios Local Package, which contains local versions of
the Fox, CBS, NBCU, and ABC broadcast stations and other similar local content.

Capital Expenditures and Investments

We continue to invest in our wireless network, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future.
During 2015, these investments included $17.8 billion for capital expenditures and $9.9 billion for acquisitions of wireless licenses. In addition, we acquired AOL
to enhance our digital media and advertising capabilities. See “Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities” and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an even more
efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy.

Trends

In the sections that follow, we provide information about the important aspects of our operations and investments, both at the consolidated and segment levels,
and  discuss  our  results  of  operations,  financial  position  and  sources  and  uses  of  cash.  In  addition,  we  highlight  key  trends  and  uncertainties  to  the  extent
practicable.

The industries that we operate in are highly competitive, which we expect to continue particularly as traditional, non-traditional and emerging service providers
seek increased market share. We believe that our high-quality customer base and superior networks differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to provide
enhanced communications experiences to our customers. We believe our focus on the fundamentals of running a good business, including operating excellence
and financial discipline, gives us the ability to plan and manage through changing economic and competitive conditions. We will continue to invest for growth,
which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareowners. We are investing in innovative technology, like wireless networks and high-speed fiber, as well
as  the  platforms  that  will  position  us  to  capture  incremental  profitable  growth  in  new  areas,  like  mobile  video  and  IoT,  to  position  ourselves  at  the  center  of
growth trends of the future.

Connection and Operating Trends

In  our  Wireless  segment,  we  expect  to  continue  to  attract  and  maintain  the  loyalty  of  high-quality  retail  postpaid  customers,  capitalizing  on  demand  for  data
services  and  bringing  our  customers  new  ways  of  using  wireless  services  in  their  daily  lives.  We  expect  that  future  connection  growth  will  be  driven  by
smartphones, tablets and other connected devices. We believe these devices will attract and retain higher value retail postpaid connections, contribute to continued
increases in the penetration of data services and help us remain competitive with other wireless carriers. We expect future growth opportunities will be dependent
on expanding the penetration of our network services, offering innovative wireless devices for both consumer and business customers and increasing the number
of  ways  that  our  customers  can  connect  with  our  network  and  services,  and  we  expect  to  manage  churn  by  focusing  on  improving  the  customer  experience
through simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels.

Service  and  equipment  pricing  play  an  important  role  in  the  wireless  competitive  landscape.  As  the  demand  for  wireless  services  continues  to  grow,  wireless
service providers are offering service plans that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or
gigabyte  sizes  or,  in  some  cases,  unlimited  data  usage  at  competitive  prices.  Some  wireless  service  providers  also  allow  customers  to  roll  over  unused  data
allowances to the next billing period. Furthermore, some wireless service providers offer price plans to new customers that undercut pricing under the customer’s
service plan with its current wireless provider. Some wireless providers also offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon
Wireless.

Many wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and
blur the traditional  boundary  between  prepaid  and postpaid plans. These payment options include device installment plans, which provide customers with the
ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans
whereby,  in  exchange  for  the  customer  entering  into  a  fixed-term  service  agreement,  the  wireless  service  providers  significantly,  and  in  some  cases  fully,
subsidized the customer’s device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on
device installment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued the use of device subsidies. As a result of the increased penetration
of device installment plans, we expect the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized service pricing to continue to grow in 2016. We compete in this area
by  offering  our  customers  services  and  devices  that  we  believe  they  will  regard  as  the  best  available  value  for  the  price,  while  meeting  their  wireless  service
needs.

In our Wireline segment, we have experienced continuing access line losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secondary lines and switched to
alternative technologies such as wireless, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) and cable for voice and data services. We expect to continue to experience access
line losses as customers continue to switch to alternate technologies. We also expect Consumer retail revenues to increase, primarily driven by our Fios services,
as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas.

Despite  this  challenging  environment,  we  expect  that  we  will  be  able  to  grow  key  aspects  of  our  Wireline  segment  by  providing  network  reliability,  offering
product  bundles  that  include  broadband  Internet  access,  digital  television  and  local  and  long  distance  voice  services,  offering  more  robust  IP  products  and
services, and accelerating our cloud computing and IoT strategies. We will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to attempt to offset adverse impacts from
unfavorable economic conditions and competitive pressures.

Operating Revenue

We expect to experience revenue growth in our Wireless segment in 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in the sale of devices under the Verizon device
payment  program.  The  increase  in  activations  of  these  devices  with  unsubsidized  service  pricing  results  in  a  relative  shift  of  revenue  from  service  revenue  to
equipment  revenue  and  causes  a  change  in  the  timing  of  the  recognition  of  revenue.  This  shift  in  revenue  is  the  result  of  recognizing  a  higher  amount  of
equipment  revenue  at  the  time  of  sale  of  devices  under  the  device  payment  program.  As  a  result  of  the  increased  penetration  of  device  installment  plans,  we
expect the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized service pricing to continue to grow in 2016.

We expect Fios broadband and video penetration to positively impact our Mass Markets revenue and subscriber base. Although we have experienced revenue
declines in our Global Enterprise business, we expect our Global Enterprise business to be positively impacted by additional revenues from application services,
such  as  our  cloud,  security  and  other  solutions-based  services  and  from  continued  customer  migration  of  their  services  to  Private  IP  and  other  strategic
networking services. We believe the trend in these growth areas as well as our offerings in telematics and video streaming will help offset the continuing decline
in revenues in our Wireline segment related to retail voice connection losses and the continued decline in our legacy wholesale and enterprise markets.

We are focused on developing new products and services as well as commercial models in mobile video and the IoT to monetize usage on our networks and
expand our revenue mix. Although we do not expect to realize material incremental revenues from these initiatives in 2016, we expect these initiatives will have a
long-term positive impact on revenues.

Operating Costs and Expenses

We anticipate our overall wireless operating costs will increase as a result of the expected increase in the volume of smartphone sales, which will result in higher
equipment costs. In addition, we expect content costs for our Fios video service to continue to increase. We also expect to incur costs related to the development
of new products and services in mobile video and IoT. However, we expect to achieve certain cost efficiencies in 2016 and beyond as we continue to streamline
our business processes with a focus on improving productivity and increasing profitability.

Upon the closing of the sale of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, we expect that our Wireline segment
EBITDA margin and operating income margin will decline. We expect to continue to undertake initiatives, including headcount and organizational realignment
initiatives, to address our cost structure to mitigate this impact to our consolidated margins.

Cash Flow from Operations

We create value for our shareowners by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable
growth,  thereby  increasing  customer  satisfaction  and  usage  of  our  products  and  services.  In  addition,  we  have  used  our  cash  flows  to  maintain  and  grow  our
dividend  payout  to  shareowners.  Verizon’s  Board  of  Directors  increased  the  Company’s  quarterly  dividend  by  2.7%  during  2015,  making  this  the  ninth
consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend.

Our goal is to use our cash to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the
business, acquire spectrum licenses (see “Cash Flows from Investing Activities”), pay dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate, buy back shares of
our outstanding common stock (see “Cash Flows from Financing Activities”). We expect to use the proceeds from the Frontier transaction to reduce our debt
levels. We also remain committed to returning to our pre Wireless Transaction credit-rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.

Capital Expenditures

Our 2016 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including 4G LTE and Fios, the continued expansion of our core networks,
including our IP and data center enhancements, and support for our copper-based legacy voice networks and other expenditures to drive operating efficiencies.
The level and the timing of the Company’s capital expenditures within these broad categories can vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors outside our
control, including, for example, material weather events. We are replacing copper wire with fiber-optic cable which will not alter our capital program but should
result in lower maintenance costs in the future. Capital expenditures were $17.8 billion in 2015 and $17.2 billion in 2014. We believe that we have significant
discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a Company-wide basis as we are not subject to any agreement that would require significant
capital  expenditures  on  a  designated  schedule  or  upon  the  occurrence  of  designated  events.  We  expect  capital  expenditures  in  2016,  which  will  be  primarily
focused on adding capacity to our 4G LTE network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands, to be in the range of approximately $17.2
billion to $17.7 billion. This includes capital spending up to approximately $150 million for the properties to be sold to Frontier.

Consolidated Results of Operations

In this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight items of a non-operational nature that are not included in our segment results. We have
two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services. In “Segment
Results of Operations,” we review the performance of our two reportable segments.

On February 21, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Vodafone’s indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless. As a result, for 2014 our results reflect our 55%
ownership of Verizon Wireless through the closing of the Wireless Transaction and reflect our full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the closing of the Wireless
Transaction through December 31, 2014.

Corporate  and  other  includes  the  operations  of  AOL  and  related  businesses,  unallocated  corporate  expenses,  the  results  of  other  businesses,  such  as  our
investments  in  unconsolidated  businesses,  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  related  costs  and  lease  financing.  Effective  January  1,  2014,  we  have  also
reclassified the results of certain businesses, such as development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, from our Wireline segment to Corporate
and other. The impact of this reclassification was not material to our consolidated financial statements or our segment results of operations. Corporate and other
also includes the historical results of divested operations and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due
to their non-operational nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings.
Gains  and  losses  that  are  not  individually  significant  are  included  in  all  segment  results  as  these  items  are  included  in  the  chief  operating  decision  maker’s
assessment of segment performance. We believe that this presentation assists users of our financial statements in better understanding our results of operations
and trends from period to period.

On July 1, 2014, our Wireline segment sold a non-strategic business (see “Acquisitions and Divestitures”). Accordingly, the historical Wireline results for these
operations, which were not material to our consolidated financial statements or our segment results of operations, have been reclassified to Corporate and other to
reflect comparable segment operating results. The results of operations related to this divestiture included within Corporate and other are as follows:

2015 Compared to 2014

The increase in consolidated revenues during 2015 was primarily due to higher equipment revenues in our Wireless segment, higher revenues as a result of the
acquisition of AOL and higher Mass Markets revenues driven by Fios services at our Wireline segment. Partially offsetting these increases were lower Service
revenues at our Wireless segment and lower Global Enterprise revenues at our Wireline segment.

Wireless’  revenues  increased  $4.0  billion,  or  4.6%,  during  2015  primarily  as  a  result  of  growth  in  equipment  revenue.  Equipment  revenue  increased  by  $6.0
billion, or 54.4% during 2015 as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones, under the Verizon device payment program, partially offset by a
decline  in  device  sales  under  traditional  fixed-term  service  plans.  Service  revenue,  which  does  not  include  recurring  device  installment  billings  related  to  the
Verizon device payment program, decreased by $2.2 billion, or 3.1%, during 2015 primarily driven by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the
Verizon device payment program on plans with unsubsidized service pricing. The increase in these activations resulted in a relative shift of revenue from service
revenue  to  equipment  revenue  and  caused  a  change  in  the  timing  of  the  recognition  of  revenue.  This  shift  in  revenue  was  the  result  of  recognizing  a  higher
amount of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the device payment program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, phone activations
under  the  Verizon  device  payment  program  represented  approximately  54%  of  retail  postpaid  phones  activated  compared  to  approximately  18%  during  2014.
During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  phone  activations  under  the  Verizon  device  payment  program  represented  approximately  67%  of  retail  postpaid  phones
activated. At December 31, 2015, approximately 29% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment program compared to
approximately  8%  at  December  31,  2014.  At  December  31,  2015,  approximately  42%  of  our  retail  postpaid  phone  connections  were  on  unsubsidized  service
pricing. Service revenue plus recurring device installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program increased 2.0% during 2015.

Retail  postpaid  connection  net  additions  decreased  during  2015  primarily  due  to  a  decrease  in  retail  postpaid  connection  gross  additions,  partially  offset  by  a
lower  retail  postpaid  connection  churn  rate.  Retail  postpaid  connections  per  account  increased  as  of  December  31,  2015  compared  to  December  31,  2014,
primarily due to increases in Internet devices.

Wireline’s revenues decreased $0.7 billion, or 1.8%, during 2015 primarily as a result of declines in Global Enterprise, partially offset by higher Mass Markets
revenues driven by Fios services.

Mass Markets revenues increased $0.4 billion, or 2.4%, during 2015 primarily due to the expansion of Fios services (voice, internet and video), including our Fios
Quantum offerings, as well as changes in our pricing strategies, partially offset by the continued decline of local exchange revenues.

Global Enterprise revenues decreased $0.7 billion, or 5.2%, during 2015 primarily due to lower voice services and data networking revenues, lower networking
solutions revenues, a decline in customer premise equipment revenues and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.

Corporate and other revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 60.6%, during 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisition of AOL, which was completed on June 23,
2015.

2014 Compared to 2013

The increase in consolidated revenues during 2014 was primarily due to higher revenues at Wireless, as well as higher Mass Markets revenues driven by Fios
services at our Wireline segment. Partially offsetting these increases were lower Global Enterprise Core and Global Wholesale revenues at our Wireline segment.

Wireless’ revenues increased $6.6 billion, or 8.2%, during 2014 primarily as a result of growth in service revenue and equipment revenue. The increase in service
revenue, which does not include recurring equipment installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program, during 2014 was primarily driven by
higher  retail  postpaid  service  revenue,  which  increased  largely  as  a  result  of  an  increase  in  retail  postpaid  connections  as  well  as  the  continued  increase  in
penetration of 4G LTE smartphones and tablets through our More Everything plans. Retail postpaid connection net additions increased during 2014 primarily due
to an increase in retail postpaid connection gross additions partially offset by an increase in our retail postpaid connection churn rate. Retail postpaid connections
per  account  increased  as  of  December  31,  2015  compared  to  December  31,  2014  primarily  due  to  the  increased  penetration  of  tablets.  Equipment  revenue
increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in device sales under both traditional fixed-term service plans and the Verizon device payment program.

Wireline’s revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 0.5%, during 2014 primarily as a result of declines in Global Enterprise Core and Global Wholesale, partially offset
by higher Mass Markets revenues driven by Fios services and increased Strategic services revenues within Global Enterprise.

Mass Markets revenues increased $0.7 billion, or 3.8%, during 2014 primarily due to the expansion of Fios services (voice, internet and video), including our Fios
Quantum offerings, as well as changes in our pricing strategies, partially offset by the continued decline of local exchange revenues.

Global Enterprise revenues decreased $0.5 billion, or 3.6%, during 2014 primarily due to lower voice services and data networking revenues, the contraction of
market  rates  due  to  competition  and  a  decline  in  Core  customer  premise  equipment  revenues.  This  decrease  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  Strategic
services revenues, primarily due to growth in our application services, such as our cloud and data center offerings and contact center solutions.

Global Wholesale revenues decreased $0.4 billion, or 5.6%, during 2014 primarily due to a decline in data revenues driven by the continuing demand for high-
speed  digital  data  services  from  fiber-to-the-cell  customers  upgrading  their  core  data  circuits  to  Ethernet  facilities,  as  well  as  a  decline  in  traditional  voice
revenues. During 2014, we also experienced a decline in domestic wholesale connections.

Consolidated  operating  expenses  decreased  during  2015  primarily  due  to  non-operational  credits  recorded  in  2015  as  compared  to  non-operational  charges
recorded  in  2014  (see  “Other  Items”).  Consolidated  operating  expenses  increased  during  2014  primarily  due  to  non-operational  charges  recorded  in  2014  as
compared to non-operational credits recorded in 2013 (see “Other Items”) as well as increased operating expenses at Wireless.

2015 Compared to 2014

Cost of Services

Cost  of  services  includes  the  following  costs  directly  attributable  to  a  service:  salaries  and  wages,  benefits,  materials  and  supplies,  content  costs,  contracted
services, network access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support, and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical
facilities.  Aggregate  customer  care  costs,  which  include  billing  and  service  provisioning,  are  allocated  between  Cost  of  services  and  Selling,  general  and
administrative expense.

Cost of services increased during 2015 primarily due to an increase in costs as a result of the acquisition of AOL, higher rent expense as a result of an increase in
wireless macro and small cell sites, higher wireless network costs from an increase in fiber facilities supporting network capacity expansion and densification,
including the deployment of small cell technology, a volume-driven increase in costs related to the wireless device protection package offered to our customers as
well as a $0.5 billion increase in content costs at our Wireline segment. Partially offsetting these increases were a $0.3 billion decline in employee costs and a
$0.3 billion decline in access costs at our Wireline segment. Also offsetting the increase was a decrease in Cost of services reflected in the results of operations
related to a non-strategic Wireline business that was divested on July 1, 2014.

Wireless Cost of Equipment

Wireless cost of equipment increased during 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the average cost per unit, driven by a shift to higher priced units in the
mix of devices sold, partially offset by a decline in the number of units sold.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense includes: salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, bad debt charges, taxes other
than income taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, customer billing, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service
fees, and rent and utilities for administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed in “Cost of Services” above.

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  decreased  during  2015  primarily  due  to  non-operational  credits,  primarily  severance,  pension  and  benefit  credits,
recorded  in  2015  as  compared  to  non-operational  charges,  primarily  severance,  pension  and  benefit  charges,  recorded  in  2014  (see  “Other  Items”).  Also
contributing  to  this  decrease  was  a  decline  in  sales  commission  expense  at  our  Wireless  segment,  which  was  driven  by  an  increase  in  activations  under  the
Verizon device payment program. The decrease is partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense at our Wireless segment. The increase in bad debt expense
was  primarily  driven  by  a  volume  increase  in  our  installment  receivables,  as  the  credit  quality  of  our  customers  remained  consistent  throughout  the  periods
presented.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2015 primarily due to $0.9 billion of depreciation and amortization expense not being recorded on our
depreciable  Wireline  assets  in  California,  Florida  and  Texas  which  were  classified  as  held  for  sale  as  of  February  5,  2015,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in
depreciable assets at our Wireless segment.

We  will  not  record  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  on  our  depreciable  Wireline  assets  in  California,  Florida  and  Texas  through  the  closing  of  the
transaction with Frontier, which is expected to occur at the end of the first quarter of 2016.

2014 Compared to 2013

Wireless Cost of Equipment

Wireless cost of equipment increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in cost of equipment sales at our Wireless segment as a result of an increase in the
number of devices sold as well as an increase in the cost per unit.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2014 primarily due to non-operational charges, primarily severance, pension and benefit charges,
recorded in 2014 as compared to non-operational credits, primarily severance, pension and benefit credits, recorded in 2013 (see “Other Items”).

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2014 primarily due to a decrease in net depreciable assets at our Wireline segment, partially offset by an
increase in depreciable assets at our Wireless segment.

Non-operational (Credits) Charges

Non-operational (credits) charges included in operating expenses (see “Other Items”) were as follows:

Consolidated  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses  (Consolidated  EBITDA)  and  Consolidated  Adjusted  EBITDA,  which  are
presented below, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. Management believes
that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they
exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating
operating performance in relation to our competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense,
equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and (expense), net to net income.

Consolidated  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  calculated  by  excluding  the  effect  of  non-operational  items  and  the  impact  of  divested  operations  from  the  calculation  of
Consolidated EBITDA. Management believes that this measure provides additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of our financial
data in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business
performance. See “Other Items” for additional details regarding these non-operational items.

Operating expenses include pension and benefit related credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates and an estimated
return on plan assets. These estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. The adjustment
has been recognized in the income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of
actuarial gains/losses.

It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’s GAAP financial information, and it should be
considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is
presented  along  with  the  corresponding  GAAP  measure  so  as  not  to  imply  that  more  emphasis  should  be  placed  on  the  non-GAAP  measure. The  non-GAAP
financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Businesses

Equity  in  earnings  of  unconsolidated  businesses  decreased  $1.9  billion  during  2015  and  increased  $1.6  billion  during  2014  primarily  due  to  the  gain  of  $1.9
billion recorded on the sale of our interest in Vodafone Omnitel N.V. (the Omnitel Transaction, and such interest, the Omnitel Interest) during the first quarter of
2014, which was part of the consideration for the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

Total  interest  costs  on  debt  balances  increased  during  2015  primarily  due  to  a  $4.9  billion  increase  in  average  debt  (see  “Consolidated  Financial  Condition”).
Capitalized interest costs were higher in 2015 primarily due to an increase in wireless licenses that are currently under development, which was a result of our
winning  bid  in  the  FCC  spectrum  license  auction  during  2015.  The  FCC  granted  us  those  wireless  licenses  on  April  8,  2015  (see  Note  2  for  additional
information).

Total interest costs on debt balances increased during 2014 primarily due to the issuance of fixed and floating rate notes to finance the Wireless Transaction (see
“Acquisitions and Divestitures”) resulting in an increase in average debt and a corresponding increase in interest expense, partially offset by a lower effective
interest  rate  (see  “Consolidated  Financial  Condition”).  Capitalized  interest  costs  were  lower  in  2014  primarily  due  to  a  decrease  in  wireless  licenses  that  are
currently under development, which was due to the deployment of AWS licenses for commercial service during 2014.

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes. The effective income tax
rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was primarily due to the
impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension and benefit charges
recorded  in  2014,  as  well  as  tax  benefits  associated  with  the  utilization  of  certain  tax  credits  in  2014  in  connection  with  the  Omnitel  Transaction.  The  2014
effective  income  tax  rate  also  included  a  benefit  from  the  inclusion  of  income  attributable  to  Vodafone’s  noncontrolling  interest  in  the  Verizon  Wireless
partnership prior to the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014.

The effective income tax rate for 2014 was 21.7% compared to 19.6% for 2013. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to additional
income taxes on the incremental income from the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014 and was partially offset by the utilization of certain tax
credits  in  connection  with  the  Omnitel  Transaction  in  2014  and  the  effective  income  tax  rate  impact  of  lower  income  before  income  taxes  due  to  severance,
pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014 compared to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2013. The decrease in the provision for income
taxes was primarily due to lower income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014 compared to severance, pension and
benefit credits recorded in 2013.

Our effective income tax rate differed significantly from the statutory federal income tax rate for 2013 due to the inclusion of income attributable to Vodafone’s
noncontrolling interest in the Verizon Wireless partnership for the full year within our income before the provision for income taxes. In 2013, we recorded a tax
provision on income before the provision for income taxes and when we included the income attributable to Vodafone’s noncontrolling interest in the Verizon
Wireless partnership in our income before the provision for income taxes it resulted in our effective income tax rate being 13.7 percentage points lower during
2013.

A  reconciliation  of  the  statutory  federal  income  tax  rate  to  the  effective  income  tax  rate  for  each  period  is  included  in  Note  12  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements.

The decrease in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the completion of the Wireless Transaction on
February 21, 2014. As a result, our results reflect our 55% ownership interest of Verizon Wireless through the closing of the Wireless Transaction and reflect our
full  ownership  of  Verizon Wireless  for  the  remainder  of  the  year.  The  noncontrolling  interests  that  remained  after  the  completion  of  the  Wireless  Transaction
primarily relate to wireless partnership entities.

Segment Results of Operations

We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services. We
measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating
decision maker’s assessment of segment performance.

Segment  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization  (Segment  EBITDA),  which  is  presented  below,  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  and  does  not
purport to be an alternative to operating income as a measure of operating performance. Management believes that this measure is useful to investors and other
users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expenses
related  primarily  to  capital  expenditures  and  acquisitions  that  occurred  in  prior  years,  as  well  as  in  evaluating  operating  performance  in  relation  to  our
competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income.

Wireless Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireless Segment EBITDA by total Wireless revenues. Wireless Segment EBITDA service margin,
also  presented  below,  is  calculated  by  dividing Wireless  Segment  EBITDA  by  Wireless  service  revenues.  Wireless  Segment  EBITDA  service  margin  utilizes
service  revenues  rather  than  total  revenues.  Service  revenues  primarily  exclude  equipment  revenues  in  order  to  reflect  the  impact  of  providing  service  to  the
wireless customer base on an ongoing basis. Wireline Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Wireline Segment EBITDA by total Wireline revenues.
You can find additional information about our segments in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Wireless

Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
United  States. Verizon  Wireless  was  formed  as  a  joint  venture  in  April  2000  by  the  combination  of  the  U.S.  wireless  operations  and  interests  of  Verizon  and
Vodafone. Prior to the completion of the Wireless Transaction, Verizon owned a controlling 55% interest in Verizon Wireless and Vodafone owned the remaining
45%. On February 21, 2014, the Wireless Transaction was completed and Verizon acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless.

We provide these services and equipment sales to consumer, business and government customers in the United States on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Postpaid
connections  represent  individual  lines  of  service  for  which  a  customer  is  billed  in  advance  a  monthly  access  charge  in  return  for  a  monthly  network  service
allowance,  and  usage  beyond  the  allowance  is  billed  monthly  in  arrears.  Our  prepaid  service  enables  individuals  to  obtain  wireless  services  without  credit
verification by paying for all services in advance.

All financial results included in the tables below reflect the consolidated results of Verizon Wireless.

  As of end of period
Excluding acquisitions and adjustments

2015 Compared to 2014

Wireless’ total operating revenues increased by $4.0 billion, or 4.6%, during 2015 primarily as a result of growth in equipment revenue.

Accounts and Connections

Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless
and use its branded services. Accounts include shared data plans, such as our new Verizon Plan and More Everything plans, and corporate accounts, as well as
legacy single connection plans and family plans. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. Retail connections
represent our retail customer device connections. Churn is the rate at which service to connections is terminated.

Retail  connections  under  an  account  may  include:  smartphones  and  basic  phones  (collectively,  phones)  as  well  as  tablets,  LTE  Internet  (Installed)  and  other
connected  devices.  Retail  postpaid  connection  net  additions  decreased  during  2015  primarily  due  to  a  decrease  in  retail  postpaid  connection  gross  additions,
partially offset by lower retail postpaid connection churn rate. The decrease in retail postpaid connection gross additions during 2015 was driven by a decline in
gross additions of smartphones, tablets and other Internet devices.

Retail Postpaid Connections per Account

Retail postpaid connections per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of
the end of the period. Retail postpaid connections per account increased as of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. The increase in retail postpaid
connections per account is primarily due to increases in Internet devices, which represented 16.8% of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31,
2015, compared to 14.1% as of December 31, 2014.

Service Revenue

Service revenue, which does not include recurring device installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased by $2.2 billion, or 3.1%,
during 2015 primarily driven by lower retail postpaid service revenue. Retail postpaid service revenue was negatively impacted as a result of an increase in the
activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program on plans with unsubsidized service pricing. The increase in these activations resulted
in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to equipment revenue and caused a change in the timing of the recognition of revenue. At December 31, 2015,
approximately 29% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment program compared to approximately 8% at December 31,
2014. At December 31, 2015, approximately 42% of our retail postpaid phone connections were on unsubsidized service pricing. The decrease in service revenue
was partially offset by the impact of an increase in retail postpaid connections as well as the continued increase in penetration of smartphones and tablets through
our shared data plans. Service revenue plus recurring device installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program increased 2.0% during 2015.

Retail postpaid ARPA (the average revenue per account from retail postpaid accounts), which does not include recurring device installment billings related to the
Verizon device payment program, was negatively impacted during 2015 as a result of the increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device
payment program on plans with unsubsidized service pricing. Partially offsetting this impact during 2015 was an increase in our retail postpaid connections per
account, as discussed above.

Equipment Revenue

Equipment revenue increased by $6.0 billion, or 54.4%, during 2015 as a result of an increase in device sales, primarily smartphones, under the Verizon device
payment program, partially offset by a decline in device sales under traditional fixed-term service plans. For the year ended December 31, 2015, phone activations
under  the  Verizon  device  payment  program  represented  approximately  54%  of  retail  postpaid  phones  activated  compared  to  approximately  18%  during  2014.
During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  phone  activations  under  the  Verizon  device  payment  program  represented  approximately  67%  of  retail  postpaid  phones
activated. The increase in these activations resulted in a relative shift of revenue from service revenue to equipment revenue and caused a change in the timing of
the recognition of revenue. This shift in revenue was the result of recognizing a higher amount of equipment revenue at the time of sale of devices under the
device payment program.

Other Revenue

Other revenue includes non-service revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surcharges, revenues associated with our device protection package, sublease
rentals and financing revenue. Other revenue increased $0.3 billion, or 7.5%, during 2015 primarily due to a volume-driven increase in revenues related to our
device protection package.

2014 Compared to 2013

Wireless’ total operating revenues increased by $6.6 billion, or 8.2%, during 2014 primarily as a result of growth in service revenue and equipment revenue.

Accounts and Connections

Retail postpaid connection net additions increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in retail postpaid connection gross additions partially offset by an
increase in our retail postpaid connection churn rate. Higher retail postpaid connection gross additions were driven by gross additions of tablets as well as 4G LTE
smartphones. During 2014, our retail postpaid connection net additions included approximately 4.2 million tablets as compared to 1.4 million tablets in 2013.

Retail Postpaid Connections per Account

Retail postpaid connections per account increased 4.0% as of December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 primarily due to the increased penetration of
tablets.

Service Revenue

Service revenue, which does not include recurring device installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program, increased by $3.6 billion, or 5.2%,
during 2014 primarily driven by higher retail postpaid service revenue, which increased largely as a result of an increase in retail postpaid connections as well as
the continued increase in penetration of 4G LTE smartphones and tablets through our More Everything plans. The penetration of 4G LTE smartphones was driven
by the activation of smartphones by new customers as well as existing customers migrating from basic phones and 3G smartphones to 4G LTE smartphones.

The increase in retail postpaid ARPA, which does not include recurring device installment billings related to the Verizon device payment program, during 2014
was  primarily  driven  by  increases  in  smartphone  penetration  and  retail  postpaid  connections  per  account.  As  of  December  31,  2014,  we  experienced  a  4.0%
increase in retail postpaid connections per account compared to 2013, with smartphones representing 79% of our retail postpaid phone base as of December 31,
2014 compared to 70% as of December 31, 2013. The increased penetration in retail postpaid connections per account is primarily due to increases in Internet
data devices, which represented 14.1% of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31, 2014 compared to 10.7% as of December 31, 2013, primarily
due to tablet activations. Additionally, during 2014, postpaid smartphone activations represented 92% of phones activated compared to 86% during 2013.

Other service revenue increased during 2014 due to growth in wholesale connections.

Equipment Revenue

Equipment  revenue  increased  during  2014  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  device  sales  under  both  traditional  fixed-term  service  plans  and  the  Verizon  device
payment program.

Cost of services increased $0.6 billion, or 8.4%, during 2015 primarily due to higher rent expense as a result of an increase in macro and small cell sites as well as
higher wireless network costs from an increase in fiber facilities supporting network capacity expansion and densification, including the deployment of small cell
technology, to meet growing customer demand for 4G LTE data services. Also contributing to the increase in Cost of services during 2015 was a volume-driven
increase in costs related to the device protection package offered to our customers.

Cost of Equipment

Cost of equipment increased $1.5 billion, or 6.9%, during 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in the average cost per unit, driven by a shift to higher priced
units in the mix of devices sold, partially offset by a decline in the number of units sold.

Cost of equipment increased during 2014 primarily due to an increase in cost of equipment sales of $5.3 billion as a result of an increase in the number of devices
sold as well as an increase in the cost per unit. The increase in the number of devices sold was driven, in part, by the launch of new devices.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  decreased  during  2015  primarily  due  to  a  $2.8  billion  decline  in  sales  commission  expense.  The  decline  in  sales
commission expense was driven by an increase in activations under the Verizon device payment program, which has a lower commission per unit than activations
under traditional fixed-term service plans, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily driven by a volume
increase in our device installment receivables, as the credit quality of our customers remained consistent throughout the periods presented.

Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2014 primarily due to a $0.2 billion increase in advertising expense and gains recorded in the first
quarter of 2013 related to wireless license exchange agreements, partially offset by a decline in sales commission expense, which was driven by the adoption of
the Verizon device payment program.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

The  increase  in  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  increased  during  2015  and  2014,  respectively,  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  net  depreciable
assets.

Wireline’s  revenues  decreased  $0.7  billion,  or  1.8%,  during  2015  primarily  driven  by  declines  in  Global  Enterprise,  partially  offset  by  higher  Mass  Markets
revenues driven by Fios services. Fios revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 8.6%, during 2015.

Mass Markets

Mass Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including high-speed Internet, Fios Internet and Fios video services), local exchange
(basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business subscribers.

2015 Compared to 2014

Mass Markets revenues increased $0.4 billion, or 2.4%, during 2015 primarily due to the expansion of Fios services (voice, Internet and video), including our
Fios Quantum offerings, as well as changes in our pricing strategies, partially offset by the continued decline of local exchange revenues.

During 2015, we grew our subscriber base by 0.4 million Fios Internet subscribers and by 0.2 million Fios video subscribers, while also improving the penetration
rate within our Fios service areas for Fios Internet. As of December 31, 2015, we achieved a penetration rate of 41.8% for Fios Internet compared to a penetration
rate of 41.1% for Fios Internet as of December 31, 2014. During 2015, Consumer Fios revenue increased $1.0 billion, or 8.3%. Fios represented approximately
79% of Consumer retail revenue during 2015 compared to approximately 76% during 2014.

The  decline  of  local  exchange  revenues  was  primarily  due  to  a  6.9%  decline  in  Consumer  retail  voice  connections  resulting  primarily  from  competition  and
technology substitution with wireless, competing VoIP and cable telephony services. Total voice connections include traditional switched access lines in service
as well as Fios digital voice connections. There was also a 7.1% decline in Small business retail voice connections, reflecting competition and a shift to both IP
and high-speed circuits, primarily in areas outside of our Fios footprint.

2014 Compared to 2013

Mass Markets revenues increased $0.7 billion, or 3.8%, during 2014 primarily due to the expansion of Fios services (voice, Internet and video), including our
Fios  Quantum  offerings,  as  well  as  changes  in  our  pricing  strategies,  partially  offset  by  the  continued  decline  of  local  exchange  revenues.  Fios  represented
approximately 76% of Consumer retail revenue during 2014 compared to approximately 71% during 2013.

During 2014, we grew our subscriber base by 0.5 million Fios Internet subscribers and by 0.4 million Fios video subscribers, while also improving penetration
rates within our Fios service areas. As of December 31, 2014, we achieved penetration rates of 41.1% and 35.8% for Fios Internet and Fios video, respectively,
compared to penetration rates of 39.5% and 35.0% for Fios Internet and Fios video, respectively, at December 31, 2013.

The increase in Mass Markets revenues was partially offset by the decline of local exchange revenues primarily due to a 5.5% decline in Consumer retail voice
connections  resulting  primarily  from  competition  and  technology  substitution  with  wireless,  competing  VoIP  and  cable  telephony  services.  Total  voice
connections include traditional switched access lines in service as well as Fios digital voice connections. There was also a decline in Small business retail voice
connections, primarily reflecting competition and a shift to both IP and high-speed circuits.

Global Enterprise

Global Enterprise offers strategic services and other core communications services to medium and large business customers, multinational corporations and state
and federal government customers.

2015 Compared to 2014

Global  Enterprise  revenues  decreased  $0.7  billion,  or  5.2%,  during  2015  primarily  due  to  a  $0.4  billion,  or  11.7%,  decline  in  core  voice  services  and  data
networking revenues, which consist of traditional circuit-based services such as frame relay, private line and legacy voice and data services. These core services
declined as a result of secular declines. Also contributing to the decrease were lower networking solutions revenues, a decline in customer premise equipment
revenues  and  the  negative  impact  of  foreign  exchange  rates.  Networking  solutions,  which  include  Private  IP,  Public  Internet,  Ethernet  and  optical  network
services, declined $0.2 billion, or 4.6%, as a result of competitive price compression.

2014 Compared to 2013

Global Enterprise revenues decreased $0.5 billion, or 3.6%, during 2014 primarily due to a decline in voice services and data networking revenues, which consist
of traditional circuit-based services such as frame relay, private line and legacy voice and data services. These core services declined as customers continued to
migrate to next generation IP services. Also contributing to the decrease was the contraction of market rates due to competition and a decline in Core customer
premise equipment revenues. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in strategic services revenues of $0.2 billion, or 2.3%, primarily due to growth in
our application services, such as our cloud and data center offerings and contract center solutions.

Global Wholesale

Global Wholesale provides communications services including data, voice and local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance and other
carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers.

2015 Compared to 2014

Global Wholesale revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 3.4%, during 2015 primarily due to declines in traditional voice revenues and data revenues driven by the
effect of technology substitution as well as continuing contraction of market rates due to competition. The decline in traditional voice revenue was primarily due
to a decrease in minutes of use (MOUs) driven by a 6.5% decline in domestic wholesale connections between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. As a
result of technology substitution, the number of core data circuits at December 31, 2015 experienced a 14.5% decline compared to December 31, 2014.

2014 Compared to 2013

Global Wholesale revenues decreased $0.4 billion, or 5.6%, during 2014 primarily due to a decline in data and traditional voice revenues. Data revenue declines
were driven by the continuing demand for high-speed digital data services from fiber-to-the-cell customers upgrading their core data circuits to Ethernet facilities.
As  a  result  of  the  customer  migrations,  at  December  31,  2014,  the  number  of  core  data  circuits  experienced  a  14.2%  decline.  The  traditional  voice  revenue
declines are primarily due to a decrease in MOUs and the effect of technology substitution. As of December 31, 2014, we also experienced a 6.2% decline in
domestic wholesale connections. Also contributing to the decline in voice revenues is the continuing contraction of market rates due to competition.

Cost of services decreased during 2015 primarily due to a $0.3 billion decline in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount as well as a $0.3 billion decline
in access costs driven by declines in overall wholesale long distance volumes. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in content costs of $0.5 billion
associated with continued Fios subscriber growth and programming license fee increases.

Cost of services decreased slightly during 2014 primarily due to a decrease in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount and a decline in access costs driven
by declines in overall wholesale long distance volumes, which was partially offset by an increase in content costs of $0.4 billion associated with continued Fios
subscriber growth and programming license fee increases.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during 2015 primarily due to declines in employee costs as a result of reduced headcount and decreased
administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in transaction taxes and regulatory expenses.

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  decreased  during  2014  primarily  due  to  declines  in  employee  costs  as  a  result  of  reduced  headcount,  decreased
advertising expense and lower transaction and property taxes.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2015 primarily due to $0.9 billion of depreciation and amortization expense not being recorded on our
assets in California, Florida and Texas, which were classified as held for sale as of February 5, 2015, as well as decreases in net depreciable assets.

We  will  not  record  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  on  our  depreciable  Wireline  assets  in  California,  Florida  and  Texas  through  the  closing  of  the
transaction with Frontier, which is expected to occur at the end of the first quarter of 2016.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2014 due to decreases in net depreciable assets.

During 2015, we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit credits of approximately $2.3 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur. The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2014 to a weighted-average of 4.6%
at December 31, 2015 ($2.5 billion), the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015 ($1.0 billion) and a change in mortality assumptions primarily
driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2015) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.9 billion), partially offset by the difference between our estimated
return on assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2014 and our actual return on assets of 0.7% at December 31, 2015 ($1.2 billion), severance costs recorded under our
existing separation plans ($0.6 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion).

During 2014, we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit charges of approximately $7.5 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur. The charges were primarily driven by a decrease in
our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2013 to a weighted-average of 4.2%
at December 31, 2014 ($5.2 billion), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (RP-2014 and MP-2014) issued by
the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 ($1.8 billion) and revisions to the retirement assumptions for participants and other assumption adjustments, partially
offset  by  the  difference  between  our  estimated  return  on  assets  of  7.25%  and  our  actual  return  on  assets  of  10.5%  ($0.6  billion).  As  part  of  this  charge,  we
recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans.

During 2013, we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit credits of approximately $6.2 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur. The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2012 to a weighted-average of 5.0%
at December 31, 2013 ($4.3 billion), lower than assumed retiree medical costs and other assumption adjustments ($1.4 billion) and the difference between our
estimated return on assets of 7.5% at December 31, 2012 and our actual return on assets of 8.6% at December 31, 2013 ($0.5 billion).

The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see “Consolidated Results of
Operations”) excludes the severance, pension and benefit (credits) charges presented above.

Early Debt Redemption and Other Costs

During March 2014, we recorded net debt redemption costs of $0.9 billion in connection with the early redemption of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of
Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC 8.50% Notes due 2018, and the purchase of the following notes pursuant to the Tender Offer: $0.7 billion of
the  then  outstanding  $1.5  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon  6.10%  Notes  due  2018,  $0.8  billion  of  the  then  outstanding  $1.5  billion  aggregate
principal amount of Verizon 5.50% Notes due 2018, $0.6 billion of the then outstanding $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 8.75% Notes due
2018, $0.7 billion of the then outstanding $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 5.55% Notes due 2016, $0.4 billion of the then outstanding $0.75
billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon  5.50%  Notes  due  2017,  $0.6  billion  of  the  then  outstanding  $1.0  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Cellco
Partnership  and  Verizon  Wireless  Capital  LLC  8.50%  Notes  due  2018,  $0.2  billion  of  the  then  outstanding  $0.3  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of Alltel
Corporation 7.00% Debentures due 2016 and $0.3 billion of the then outstanding $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of GTE Corporation 6.84% Debentures
due 2018.

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Tender Offer.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2014,  we  recorded  net  debt  redemption  costs  of  $0.5  billion  in  connection  with  the  early  redemption  of  $0.5  billion  aggregate
principal amount of Verizon 4.90% Notes due 2015, $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 5.55% Notes due 2016, $1.3 billion aggregate principal
amount of Verizon 3.00% Notes due 2016, $0.4 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 5.50% Notes due 2017, $0.7 billion aggregate principal amount of
Verizon  8.75%  Notes  due  2018,  $1.0  billion  of  the  then  outstanding  $3.2  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon  2.50%  Notes  due  2016,  $0.1  billion
aggregate  principal  amount  Alltel  Corporation  7.00%  Debentures  due  2016  and  $0.4  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Cellco  Partnership  and  Verizon
Wireless Capital LLC 8.50% Notes due 2018, as well as $0.3 billion of other costs.

We recognize early debt redemption costs in Other income and (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.

Gain on Spectrum License Transactions

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a license exchange transaction with an affiliate of T-Mobile USA Inc. (T-Mobile USA) to exchange certain AWS
and Personal Communication Services (PCS) licenses. As a result of this non-cash exchange, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair
value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.3 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the
year ended December 31, 2015.

During the second quarter of 2014, we completed license exchange transactions with T-Mobile USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS licenses. The exchange
included a number of swaps that we expect will result in more efficient use of the AWS and PCS bands. As a result of these exchanges, we received $0.9 billion
of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded an immaterial gain.

During the second quarter of 2014, we completed transactions pursuant to two additional agreements with T-Mobile USA with respect to our remaining 700 MHz
A block spectrum licenses. Under one agreement, we sold certain of these licenses to T-Mobile USA in exchange for cash consideration of approximately $2.4
billion, and under the second agreement we exchanged the remainder of our 700 MHz A block spectrum licenses as well as AWS and PCS spectrum licenses for
AWS  and  PCS  spectrum  licenses.  As  a  result,  we  received  $1.6  billion  of  AWS  and  PCS  spectrum  licenses  at  fair  value  and  we  recorded  a  pre-tax  gain  of
approximately $0.7 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014.

During the third quarter of 2013, after receiving the required regulatory approvals, Verizon Wireless sold 39 lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to AT&T
in exchange for a payment of $1.9 billion and the transfer by AT&T to Verizon Wireless of AWS (10 MHz) licenses in certain markets in the western United
States. Verizon Wireless also sold certain lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to an investment firm for a payment of $0.2 billion. As a result, we received
$0.5 billion of AWS licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.3 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see “Consolidated Results of
Operations”) excludes the gains on the spectrum license transactions described above.

Wireless Transaction Costs

As  a  result  of  the  third-party  indebtedness  incurred  to  finance  the  Wireless  Transaction,  we  incurred  interest  expense  of  $0.4  billion  during  2014  (see
“Consolidated Financial Condition”). This amount represents the interest expense incurred prior to the closing of the Wireless Transaction.

During 2013, as a result of the Wireless Transaction, we recorded costs of $0.9 billion primarily for interest expense of $0.7 billion related to the issuance of the
new notes, as well as $0.2 billion in fees primarily in connection with the bridge credit agreement (see “Consolidated Financial Condition”).

Gain on Sale of Omnitel Interest

As a result of the sale of the Omnitel Interest on February 21, 2014, which was part of the consideration for the Wireless Transaction, we recorded a gain of $1.9
billion in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated businesses on our consolidated statement of income during 2014.

Impact of Divested Operations

On July 1, 2014, we sold a non-strategic Wireline business that provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies.

The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Operating Income and EBITDA discussion (see “Consolidated Results of
Operations”) excludes the historical financial results of the divested operations described above.

We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund network expansion and modernization, service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in
new businesses and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent
necessary,  from  external  financing  arrangements,  are  sufficient  to  meet  ongoing  operating  and  investing  requirements.  We  expect  that  our  capital  spending
requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or
development  activities  or  to  maintain  an  appropriate  capital  structure  to  ensure  our  financial  flexibility.  Our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  primarily  held
domestically and are invested to maintain principal and liquidity. Accordingly, we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. See “Market
Risk” for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.

Our available external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program, credit available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit,
vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities and privately-placed capital market securities. In addition, in 2015, we established
an  active  program  to  sell  selected  device  installment  plan  receivables  under  the  Verizon  device  payment  program  to  a  group  of  primarily  relationship  banks
(Purchasers).

Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities

Our  primary  source  of  funds  continues  to  be  cash  generated  from  operations,  primarily  from  our  Wireless  segment.  Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities
during  2015  increased  by  $8.3  billion  primarily  due  to  $5.9  billion  of  cash  proceeds,  net  of  remittances,  related  to  the  sale  of  wireless  device  installment
receivables as well as $2.4 billion of cash proceeds received related to the Tower Monetization Transaction attributable to the portion of the towers for which the
right-of-use has passed to the tower operator (see Note 2) as well as an increase in earnings at our Wireless segment.

During  2015,  we  established  an  on-going  program  to  sell  from  time  to  time,  on  an  uncommitted  basis,  selected  device  installment  plan  receivables  under  the
Verizon  device  payment  program  to  the  Purchasers.  Under  the  program,  we  transfer  the  receivables  to  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  that  are  bankruptcy  remote
special purpose entities (Sellers). The Sellers then sell the receivables to the Purchasers for cash and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables
(the  deferred  purchase  price).  The  receivables  sold  under  the  program  are  no  longer  considered  assets  of  Verizon.  We  continue  to  bill  and  collect  on  the
receivables in exchange for a monthly servicing fee, which is not material.

Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  during  2014  decreased  by  $8.2  billion  due  in  part  to  a  $3.7  billion  increase  in  income  tax  payments  due  to  the
incremental pre-tax income attributable to Verizon included in Verizon’s income since the closing of the Wireless Transaction. Also contributing to the decrease
was a $2.3 billion increase in interest payments primarily due to the incremental debt needed to fund the Wireless Transaction as well as a $1.5 billion increase in
pension contributions. The decrease in Cash flows provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in earnings at our Wireless segment.

On February 21, 2014, we completed the Wireless Transaction which provides full access to the cash flows of Verizon Wireless. Having full access to all the cash
flows from our wireless business gives us the ability to continue to invest in our networks and spectrum, meet evolving customer requirements for products and
services and take advantage of new growth opportunities across our lines of business.

Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures continue to be a primary use of capital resources as they facilitate the introduction of new products and services, enhance responsiveness to
competitive challenges and increase the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks.

Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were as follows:

Capital expenditures increased at Wireless in 2015 and 2014 in order to increase the capacity of our 4G LTE network. Capital expenditures declined at Wireline in
2015 and 2014 as a result of decreased legacy spending requirements as well as decreased Fios spending requirements in 2015.

Acquisitions

During  2015,  2014  and  2013,  we  invested  $9.9  billion,  $0.4  billion  and  $0.6  billion,  respectively,  in  acquisitions  of  wireless  licenses.  During  2015,  2014  and
2013, we also invested $3.5 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, in acquisitions of investments and businesses, net of cash acquired.

On January 29, 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the AWS-3 band. Verizon participated in that auction, and was
the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made a deposit of $0.9
billion related to our participation in this auction, which is classified within Other, net investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an application to the FCC and paid $9.5 billion to the FCC to complete payment for
these licenses. The cash payment of $9.5 billion is classified within Acquisitions of wireless licenses on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2015. On April 8, 2015, the FCC granted us these spectrum licenses.

On May 12, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with AOL pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. On June 23, 2015, we
completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing
of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash acquired of $0.5 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised appraisal rights
under Delaware law. If they had not exercised these rights, Verizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at closing. See Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

In October 2015, AOL acquired an advertising technology business for cash consideration that was not significant.

In February 2014, Verizon acquired a business dedicated to the development of IP television for cash consideration that was not significant.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2013,  Verizon  acquired  an  industry  leader  in  content  delivery  networks  for  $0.4  billion.  Additionally,  we  acquired  a  technology
company for cash consideration that was not significant.

Dispositions

During 2014, we received proceeds of $2.4 billion related to spectrum license transactions and $0.1 billion related to the disposition of a non-strategic Wireline
business. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

During 2013, we completed the sale of 700 MHz lower B block spectrum licenses and as a result, we received proceeds of $2.1 billion.

Other, net

On May 19, 2015, Verizon consummated a sale-leaseback transaction with a financial services firm for the buildings and real estate at our Basking Ridge, New
Jersey location. We received total gross proceeds of $0.7 billion resulting in a deferred gain of $0.4 billion, which will be amortized over the initial leaseback
term of twenty years. The leaseback of the buildings and real estate is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction
have been classified within Other, net investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Also in 2015, Verizon received proceeds of $0.2 billion related
to a sale of real estate.

Cash Flows Provided by (Used In) Financing Activities

We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, net cash
provided by (used in) financing activities was $(15.0) billion, $(57.7) billion and $26.5 billion, respectively.

2015

During 2015, our net cash used in financing activities of $15.0 billion was primarily driven by:

•   $9.3 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations, including the repayment of $6.5 billion of borrowings under a

term loan agreement;

•   $8.5 billion used for dividend payments; and

•   $5.0 billion payment for our accelerated share repurchase agreement.

These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $6.7 billion, which included $6.5 billion of borrowings under a term loan
agreement which was used for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of spectrum licenses, as well as $2.7 billion of cash proceeds received related
to the Tower Monetization Transaction attributable to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations.

Proceeds from and Repayments of Long-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2015, our total debt decreased to $110.2 billion as compared to $113.3 billion at December 31, 2014. The substantial majority of our total debt
portfolio  consists  of  fixed  rate  indebtedness,  therefore,  changes  in  interest  rates  do  not  have  a  material  effect  on  our  interest  payments.  See  Note  7  to  the
consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our debt activity.

At December 31, 2015, approximately $8.2 billion or 7.5% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt,
primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars
and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See “Market Risk” for additional information.

Verizon may continue to acquire debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates in the future through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions,
tender offers, exchange offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Verizon may from time to time determine for cash or other consideration.

Other, net

Other, net financing activities during 2015, include $2.7 billion of cash proceeds received related to the Tower Monetization Transaction, which relates to the
portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network operations, partially offset by the settlement of derivatives upon maturity for $0.4 billion.

Dividends

The  Verizon  Board  of  Directors  assesses  the  level  of  our  dividend  payments  on  a  periodic  basis  taking  into  account  such  factors  as  long-term  growth
opportunities, internal cash requirements and the expectations of our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2015, the Board increased our quarterly dividend
payment 2.7% to $.565 per share from $.550 per share in the prior period. This is the ninth consecutive year that Verizon’s Board of Directors has approved a
quarterly dividend increase.

As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2015, we paid $8.5 billion in dividends.

2014

During 2014, our net cash used in financing activities of $57.7 billion was primarily driven by:

•   $58.9 billion used to partially fund the Wireless Transaction (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements);

•   $17.7 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations; and

•   $7.8 billion used for dividend payments.

These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $31.0 billion.

Proceeds from and Repayments of Long-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2014, our total debt increased to $113.3 billion as compared to $93.6 billion at December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of additional debt issued
to finance the Wireless Transaction. Since the substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate

indebtedness, changes in interest rates do not have a material effect on our interest payments. Throughout 2014, we accessed the capital markets to optimize the
maturity schedule of our debt portfolio and take advantage of lower interest rates, thereby reducing our effective interest rate to 4.9% from 5.2% in 2013. See
Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our debt activity.

At December 31, 2014, approximately $9.6 billion or 8.5% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt,
primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars
and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See “Market Risk” for additional information.

See “Other Items” for additional information related to the early debt redemption costs incurred in 2014.

Dividends

During the third quarter of 2014, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 3.8% to $.550 per share from $.530 per share in the same period of 2013.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2014, we paid $7.8 billion in dividends compared to $5.9 billion in
2013. The increase is primarily due to the issuance of approximately 1.27 billion additional shares of common stock as a result of the Wireless Transaction.

2013

During 2013, our net cash provided by financing activities of $26.5 billion was primarily driven by proceeds from long-term borrowings of $49.2 billion to fund
the Wireless Transaction. This source of cash was partially offset by:

•   $8.2 billion used for repayments of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations;

•   $5.9 billion used for dividend payments; and

•   $3.2 billion used for a special distribution to a noncontrolling interest.

Proceeds from and Repayments of Long-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2013, our total debt increased to $93.6 billion as compared to $52.0 billion at December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of additional debt issued
to finance the Wireless Transaction. Since the substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, changes in interest rates do not
have a material effect on our interest payments. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our debt activity.

Dividends

During the third quarter of 2013, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.9% to $.530 per share from $.515 per share in the same period of 2012.
As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources.

Special Distributions

In May 2013, the Board of Representatives of Verizon Wireless declared a distribution to its owners, which was paid in the second quarter of 2013 in proportion
to their partnership interests on the payment date, in the aggregate amount of $7.0 billion. As a result, Vodafone received a cash payment of $3.15 billion and the
remainder of the distribution was received by Verizon.

Other, net

The change in Other, net financing activities during 2013 was primarily driven by higher distributions to Vodafone, which owned a 45% noncontrolling interest in
Verizon Wireless as of December 31, 2013.

Credit Facility

As of December 31, 2015, the unused borrowing capacity under our $8.0 billion four-year credit facility was approximately $7.9 billion. The credit facility does
not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material
adverse change. We use the credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit and for general corporate purposes.

Common Stock

Common  stock  has  been  used  from  time  to  time  to  satisfy  some  of  the  funding  requirements  of  employee  and  shareholder  plans,  including  22.6  million,
18.2 million and 6.9 million common shares issued from Treasury stock during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which had aggregate values of $0.9 billion,
$0.7 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively.

In February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of
the  Company’s  common  stock.  On  February  10,  2015,  in  exchange  for  an  upfront  payment  totaling  $5.0  billion,  Verizon  received  an  initial  delivery  of
86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion. On June 5, 2015, Verizon received an additional 15.4 million shares as final settlement of the
transaction under the ASR agreement. In total, 101.6 million shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21.

On March 7, 2014, the Verizon Board of Directors approved a share buyback program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of Verizon
common  stock  terminating  no  later  than  the  close  of  business  on  February  28,  2017.  The  program  permits  Verizon  to  repurchase  shares  over  time,  with  the
amount  and  timing  of  repurchases  depending  on  market  conditions  and  corporate  needs.  The  Board  also  determined  that  no  additional  shares  were  to  be
purchased under the prior program. During 2015, we repurchased $0.1 billion of our common stock as part of our previously announced share buyback program.
There were no repurchases of common stock during 2014. During 2013, we repurchased $0.2 billion of our common stock under our previous share buyback
program.

As a result of the Wireless Transaction, in February 2014, Verizon issued approximately 1.27 billion shares.

Credit Ratings

Verizon’s credit ratings did not change in 2015 or 2014.

During  the  third  quarter  of  2013,  Verizon’s  credit  ratings  were  downgraded  by  Moody’s  Investors  Service  (Moody’s),  Standard  &  Poor’s  Ratings  Services
(Standard  &  Poor’s)  and  Fitch  Ratings  (Fitch)  as  a  result  of  Verizon’s  announcement  of  the  agreement  to  acquire  Vodafone’s  45%  noncontrolling  interest  in
Verizon  Wireless  for  approximately  $130  billion  including  the  incurrence  of  third-party  indebtedness  to  fund  the  cash  portion  of  the  purchase  price  for  the
Wireless Transaction. Moody’s downgraded Verizon’s long-term debt ratings one notch from A3 to Baa1, while Standard & Poor’s lowered its corporate credit
rating and senior unsecured debt rating one notch from A- to BBB+ and Fitch lowered its long-term issuer default rating and senior unsecured debt rating one
notch from A to A-.

Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is
subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Covenants

Our  credit  agreements  contain  covenants  that  are  typical  for  large,  investment  grade  companies.  These  covenants  include  requirements  to  pay  interest  and
principal  in  a  timely  fashion,  pay  taxes,  maintain  insurance  with  responsible  and  reputable  insurance  companies,  preserve  our  corporate  existence,  keep
appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain our properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition
of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other similar covenants. Additionally, our term loan credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (as
such term is defined in those agreements) not in excess of 3.50:1.00 until our credit ratings are equal to or higher than A3 and A-. See Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional details related to our term loan credit agreement.

We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our financial and restrictive covenants.

Increase (Decrease) In Cash and Cash Equivalents

Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 totaled $4.5 billion, a $6.1 billion decrease compared to Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014
primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 totaled $10.6 billion, a $42.9 billion decrease compared
to  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  at  December  31,  2013  primarily  as  a  result  of  the  cash  payment  made  to  Vodafone  as  part  of  the  completion  of  the  Wireless
Transaction.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of Verizon’s financial information in evaluating
cash  available  to  pay  debt  and  dividends.  Free  cash  flow  is  calculated  by  subtracting  capital  expenditures  from  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities.  The
following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to Free cash flow:

The changes in free cash flow during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were a result of the factors described in connection with net cash provided by operating activities and
capital expenditures. During 2015, we received $5.9 billion of cash proceeds, net of remittances, related to the sale of wireless device installment receivables as
well as $2.4 billion of cash proceeds received related to the Tower Monetization Transaction attributable to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use
has passed to the tower operator. On February 21, 2014, we completed the Wireless Transaction which provides full access to the cash flows of Verizon Wireless.
The completion of the Wireless Transaction resulted in an increase in income tax payments as well as an increase in interest payments, which reduced our net
cash provided by operating activities during 2014 (see “Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities”).

Employee Benefit Plan Funded Status and Contributions

Employer Contributions

We operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our domestic business units.
During 2015 and 2014, contributions to our qualified pension plans were $0.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. During 2013, contributions to our qualified
pension  plans  were  not  material.  We  also  contributed  $0.1  billion,  $0.1  billion  and  $0.1  billion  to  our  nonqualified  pension  plans  in  2015,  2014  and  2013,
respectively.

In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to
better match cash flows from investments with projected benefit payments. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time
when  liabilities  increase  (referred  to  as  liability  hedging),  with  the  goal  to  reduce  the  risk  of  underfunding  to  the  plan  and  its  participants  and  beneficiaries,
however, we also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns. Based on this strategy and the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2015, we expect the
minimum  required  qualified  pension  plan  contribution  in  2016  to  be  $0.6  billion.  Nonqualified  pension  contributions  are  estimated  to  be  approximately  $0.1
billion in 2016.

Contributions  to  our  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  generally  relate  to  payments  for  benefits  on  an  as-incurred  basis  since  the  other  postretirement  benefit
plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $0.9 billion, $0.7 billion and $1.4 billion to our other postretirement benefit
plans in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $0.9 billion in 2016.

  The  purchase  obligations  reflected  above  are  primarily  commitments  to  purchase  programming  and  network  services,  equipment,  software,  handsets  and
peripherals,  and  marketing  activities,  which  will  be  used  or  sold  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business. These  amounts  do  not  represent  our  entire  anticipated
purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no
firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented in this table alone do not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows or changes
in our expected cash position (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).

(4)

  Other  long-term  liabilities  include  estimated  postretirement  benefit  and  qualified  pension  plan  contributions  (see  Note  11  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements).

(5)

  Represents future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement for our tower transaction (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).

We are not able to make a reliable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $1.6 billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the
respective taxing authorities until issues or examinations are further developed (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).

Guarantees

We guarantee the debentures and first mortgage bonds of our operating telephone company subsidiaries as well as the debt obligations of GTE Corporation that
were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).

In  connection  with  the  execution  of  agreements  for  the  sale  of  businesses  and  investments,  Verizon  ordinarily  provides  representations  and  warranties  to  the
purchasers  pertaining  to  a  variety  of  nonfinancial  matters,  such  as  ownership  of  the  securities  being  sold,  as  well  as  financial  losses  (see  Note  16  to  the
consolidated financial statements).

As  of  December  31,  2015,  letters  of  credit  totaling  approximately  $0.1  billion,  which  were  executed  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  support  several
financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).

Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include
the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, foreign currency and prepaid forwards and collars, interest rate swap agreements, commodity
swap and forward agreements and interest rate locks. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes.

It is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives
in  optimizing  exposure  to  various  market  risks.  Our  objectives  include  maintaining  a  mix  of  fixed  and  variable  rate  debt  to  lower  borrowing  costs  within
reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk
exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. At December 31, 2015
and 2014, we posted collateral of approximately $0.1 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements.
During the first and second quarter of 2015, we paid an immaterial amount of cash to enter into amendments to certain collateral exchange arrangements. These
amendments  suspend  cash  collateral  posting  for  a  specified  period  of  time  by  both  counterparties.  While  we  may  be  exposed  to  credit  losses  due  to  the
nonperformance  of  our  counterparties,  we  consider  the  risk  remote.  As  such,  we  do  not  expect  that  our  results  of  operations  or  financial  condition  will  be
materially affected by these risk management strategies.

Interest Rate Risk

We  are  exposed  to  changes  in  interest  rates,  primarily  on  our  short-term  debt  and  the  portion  of  long-term  debt  that  carries  floating  interest  rates.  As  of
December 31, 2015, approximately 81% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, including the effect of
interest  rate  swap  agreements  designated  as  hedges.  The  impact  of  a  100  basis  point  change  in  interest  rates  affecting  our  floating  rate  debt  would  result  in  a
change in annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $0.2 billion. The interest rates on
substantially all of our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings.

The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2015
and  2014.  The  table  also  provides  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  estimated  fair  values  of  these  financial  instruments  assuming  100-basis-point  upward  and
downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not
significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.

We enter into domestic interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based
on LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against changes in the fair value
of our debt portfolio. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities.

During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $3.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into
interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $2.6 billion. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $7.6 billion
and $1.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was $0.1 billion at December 31, 2015 and was not material at December 31, 2014. The ineffective
portion of these interest rate swaps was not material at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Forward Interest Rate Swaps

In order to manage our exposure to future interest rate changes, we have entered into forward interest rate swaps. We designated these contracts as cash flow
hedges. At December 31, 2014, these swaps had a notional value of $2.0 billion. The fair value of these contracts was $0.2 billion at December 31, 2014, which
was included within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2015, we settled these forward interest rate swaps and the pre-
tax loss was not material. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into forward interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.8 billion. The fair value of
these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency. The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign
operations  into  U.S.  dollars  is  recorded  as  cumulative  translation  adjustments,  which  are  included  in  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  in  our
consolidated  balance  sheets.  Gains  and  losses  on  foreign  currency  transactions  are  recorded  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income  in  Other  income  and
(expense), net. At December 31, 2015, our primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar.

Cross Currency Swaps

Verizon Wireless previously entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $1.6 billion of British Pound Sterling
and Euro-denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign
currency  transaction  gains  or  losses.  In  June  2014,  we  settled  $0.8  billion  of  these  cross  currency  swaps  and  the  gains  with  respect  to  these  swaps  were  not
material. In December 2015, we settled $0.6 billion of these cross currency swaps on maturity.

During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $5.4 billion of Euro and British
Pound Sterling denominated debt into U.S. dollars. During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to
exchange  approximately  $1.2  billion  of  British  Pound  Sterling  denominated  debt  into  U.S.  dollars.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2014,  we  entered  into  cross
currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $3.0 billion of Euro denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest
and principal payments in U.S. dollars. Each of these cross currency swaps was entered into in order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains
or losses.

A portion of the gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive income was reclassified to Other income and (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax
foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying debt obligations. The fair value of the outstanding swaps was $1.6 billion and $0.6 billion, which was
primarily  included  within  Other  liabilities  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  at  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  respectively.  At  December  31,  2015,  the  total
notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $9.7 billion. During 2015 and 2014, a pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion and a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion, respectively,
was recognized in Other comprehensive income with respect to these swaps.

Net Investment Hedges

We entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar
net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into net investment hedges
with a total notional value of $0.9 billion with the contract tenor maturing in 2018. The fair value of these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Critical Accounting Estimates

A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows:

•   Wireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived
intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an
earlier  assessment  or  changes  in  circumstances  during  an  interim  period  that  indicate  these  assets  may  not  be  recoverable.  We  believe  our  estimates  and
assumptions  are  reasonable  and  represent  appropriate  marketplace  considerations  as  of  the  valuation  date.  Although  we  use  consistent  methodologies  in
developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can
vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our assumptions, including estimated cash flow projections, margins, growth
rates and discount rate, which could result in different fair value estimates and an impairment charge.

Wireless Licenses

The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $86.6 billion as of December 31, 2015. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit
of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our wireless licenses provide us with the
exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual,
competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.

In 2015, our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount
as of the test date. If the estimated fair value of our aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses then an
impairment charge would have been recognized. Our quantitative impairment test for 2015 indicated that the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying
value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.

In 2015, using a quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an
income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that
goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant
would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about
future cash flows specifically associated with our wireless licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows
and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless
network  technology  and  infrastructure  and  related  equipment  and  the  costs  thereof  as  well  as  other  relevant  factors  in  estimating  future  cash  flows.  The
discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required
as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the
valuation  date.  Accordingly,  our  discount  rate  incorporated  our  estimate  of  the  expected  return  a  marketplace  participant  would  have  required  as  of  the
valuation date, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth
rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate.

In 2014 and 2013, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses
was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of Wireless,
macroeconomic  conditions  (including  changes  in  interest  rates  and  discount  rates),  industry  and  market  considerations  (including  industry  revenue  and
EBITDA  margin  projections),  the  projected  financial  performance  of  Wireless,  as  well  as  other  factors.  Based  on  our  assessment  in  2014  and  2013,  we
qualitatively concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses significantly exceeded their carrying value and therefore, did
not result in an impairment.

Goodwill

At December 31, 2015, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $25.3 billion, of which $18.4 billion was in our Wireless reporting unit, $4.3 billion
was  in  our  Wireline  reporting  unit  and  $2.6  billion  was  in  our  other  reporting  unit.  Determining  whether  an  impairment  has  occurred  requires  the
determination  of  fair  value  of  each  respective  reporting  unit.  The  fair  value  of  our  reporting  units  exceeded  the  carrying  values.  Accordingly,  our  annual
impairment tests for 2015, 2014 and 2013 did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units, the fair
value would have still exceeded the book value of the reporting unit and no impairment charge would be recorded.

The  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  calculated  using  a  market  approach  and  a  discounted  cash  flow  method.  The  market  approach  includes  the  use  of
comparative  multiples  to  corroborate  discounted  cash  flow  results.  The  discounted  cash  flow  method  is  based  on  the  present  value  of  two  components—
projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows
from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete
period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the WACC, or expected return, that a marketplace participant
would have required as of the valuation date.

•   We maintain benefit plans for most of our employees, including, for certain employees, pension and other postretirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2015,
in the aggregate, pension plan benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets, which will result in higher future pension plan expense. Other
postretirement benefit plans have larger benefit obligations than plan assets, resulting in expense. Significant benefit plan assumptions, including the discount
rate used, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact
the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for
pension and other postretirement benefits. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations and expense (income)
recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2015 and for
the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans is provided in the table below.

* In  determining  its  pension  and  other  postretirement  obligation,  the  Company  used  a  weighted-average  discount  rate  of  4.6%.  The  rate  was  selected  to
approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2015. The bonds selected
had  maturities  that  coincided  with  the  time  periods  during  which  benefits  payments  are  expected  to  occur,  were  non-callable  and  available  in  sufficient
quantities to ensure marketability (at least $0.3 billion par outstanding).

The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31 . Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the full yield
curve  approach  to  estimate  the  interest  cost  component  of  net  periodic  benefit  cost  for  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefits.  We  will  account  for  this
change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Prior to this change, we
estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at
the beginning of the period.

st

The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on
several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future
cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.

This change in accounting estimate does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations at year end or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the
change in the interest cost is offset in the actuarial gain or loss recorded at year end. Accordingly, this change in accounting estimate has no impact on our
annual consolidated GAAP results. We estimate the impact of this change on our consolidated GAAP results for the first quarter of 2016 will be a reduction of
the  interest  cost  component  of  net  periodic  benefit  cost  and  an  increase  to  Net  income  by  approximately  $0.1  billion.  However,  at  this  time  the  estimated
impact of this change on the remaining 2016 interim periods and for annual 2016 results cannot be reasonably estimated because it is possible that in the future
there may be changes to underlying assumptions, including an interim remeasurement of our benefit obligations, which could result in different estimates. Our
non-GAAP measure for segment EBITDA is unaffected because net periodic benefit costs are not included in our segment results. For additional discussion of
Non-GAAP measures and non-operational items see “Consolidated Results of Operations”.

•   Our current and deferred income taxes, and associated valuation allowances, are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business
as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-
recurring  items.  As  a  global  commercial  enterprise,  our  income  tax  rate  and  the  classification  of  income  taxes  can  be  affected  by  many  factors,  including
estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or
expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-
step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax
benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances, and information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of
these tax positions is different than the

amounts  recorded,  such  differences  may  impact  income  tax  expense  and  actual  tax  payments.  We  recognize  any  interest  and  penalties  accrued  related  to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well
as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances.

•   Our Plant, property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record Plant, property and equipment at cost. We
depreciate Plant, property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We expect that a one-year increase in estimated
useful lives of our Plant, property and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2015 depreciation expense of $2.8 billion and that a one-year decrease
would result in an increase of approximately $7.2 billion in our 2015 depreciation expense.

•   We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our device installment plan receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure
or inability of our customers to make required payments. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’s assessment of the
collectability  of  specific  customer  accounts  and  includes  consideration  of  the  credit  worthiness  and  financial  condition  of  those  customers.  We  record  an
allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on
multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration
of customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our
allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Wireless

Wireless Transaction

On February 21, 2014, we completed the Wireless Transaction for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion. The consideration paid was primarily
comprised of cash of approximately $58.89 billion, Verizon common stock with a value of approximately $61.3 billion and other consideration.

Omnitel Transaction

On  February  21,  2014,  Verizon  and  Vodafone  also  consummated  the  sale  of  the  Omnitel  Interest  (the  Omnitel  Transaction)  by  a  subsidiary  of  Verizon  to  a
subsidiary of Vodafone in connection with the Wireless Transaction pursuant to a separate share purchase agreement. As a result, during 2014, we recognized a
pre-tax gain of $1.9 billion on the disposal of the Omnitel interest.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Wireless Transaction.

Spectrum License Transactions

In January 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in the auction and were the high bidder on 181
spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015.

From  time  to  time,  we  enter  into  agreements  to  buy,  sell  or  exchange  spectrum  licenses.  We  believe  these  spectrum  license  transactions  have  allowed  us  to
continue to enhance the reliability of our network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional details regarding our spectrum license transactions.

Tower Monetization Transaction

During  March  2015,  we  completed  a  transaction  with  American  Tower  pursuant  to  which  American  Tower  acquired  the  exclusive  right  to  lease,  acquire  or
otherwise operate and manage many of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.1 billion, which also included payment for the sale of 162 towers. See
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Wireline

During  July  2014,  Verizon  sold  a  non-strategic  Wireline  business  for  cash  consideration  that  was  not  significant.  See  Note  2  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements for additional information.

Access Line Sale

On February 5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier pursuant to which Verizon will sell its local exchange business
and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed
Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5 billion net of income taxes), subject to
certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. We expect this transaction to close at the end of the
first quarter of 2016. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Other

Acquisition of AOL Inc.

On May 12, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with AOL pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by
Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised their appraisal rights under
Delaware law. If they had not exercised these rights, Verizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at the closing.

AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital
content and advertising. AOL’s business model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a
digital  advertising  platform  enhances  our  ability  to  further  develop  future  revenue  streams.  See  Note  2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional
information.

Other

On  September  3,  2015,  AOL  announced  an  agreement  to  acquire  an  advertising  technology  business  for  cash  consideration  that  was  not  significant.  The
transaction was completed in October 2015.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2014,  Redbox  Instant  by  Verizon,  a  venture  between  Verizon  and  Redbox  Automated  Retail,  LLC  (Redbox),  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of Outerwall Inc., ceased providing service to its customers. In accordance with an agreement between the parties, Redbox withdrew from the venture
on  October  20,  2014  and  Verizon  wound  down  and  dissolved  the  venture  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2014. As  a  result  of  the  termination  of  the  venture,  we
recorded a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.

During February 2014, Verizon acquired a business dedicated to the development of IP television for cash consideration that was not significant.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, Verizon acquired an industry leader in content delivery networks for $0.4 billion.

Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Based on this assessment, we
believe that the internal control over financial reporting of the company is effective as of December 31, 2015. In connection with this assessment, there were no
material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified by management.

The company’s financial statements included in this Annual Report have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm.
Ernst & Young LLP has also provided an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

To The Board of Directors and Shareowners of Verizon Communications Inc.:

We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria
established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the
COSO criteria). Verizon’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our  audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In  our  opinion,  Verizon  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2015,  based  on  the  COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Verizon as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and our report dated February 23, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Board of Directors and Shareowners of Verizon Communications Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries (Verizon) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  income,  comprehensive  income,  cash  flows  and  changes  in  equity  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended
December  31,  2015.  These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  Verizon’s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Verizon at December 31,
2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  Verizon’s  internal  control  over
financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2015,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control–Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 23, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of
communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies with a presence around the world. We
have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline. For further information concerning our business segments, see Note 13.

The Wireless segment provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive and reliable wireless networks in the United
States (U.S.) and has the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) networks of any U.S. wireless service
provider.

The Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate networking
solutions,  data  center  and  cloud  services,  security  and  managed  network  services  and  local  and  long  distance  voice  services.  We  provide  these  products  and
services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world.

Consolidation

The method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated, equity or cost, involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that
explicitly  grant  or  suggest  evidence  of  control  or  influence  over  the  operations  of  the  investee.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  our  controlled
subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned,
the  noncontrolling  interests  are  included  in  Net  income  and  Total  equity.  Investments  in  businesses  which  we  do  not  control,  but  have  the  ability  to  exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we do not have the ability to exercise
significant  influence  over  operating  and  financial  policies  are  accounted  for  under  the  cost  method.  Equity  and  cost  method  investments  are  included  in
Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Basis of Presentation

We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Examples  of  significant  estimates  include:  the  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts,  the  recoverability  of  plant,  property  and  equipment,  the  recoverability  of
intangible assets and other long-lived assets, fair values of financial instruments, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, accrued expenses,
pension  and  postretirement  benefit  assumptions,  contingencies  and  the  identification  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  connection  with  business
combinations.

Revenue Recognition

Multiple Deliverable Arrangements

We offer products and services to our wireless and wireline customers through bundled arrangements. These arrangements involve multiple deliverables which
may include products, services, or a combination of products and services.

Wireless

Our Wireless segment earns revenue primarily by providing access to and usage of its network as well as the sale of equipment. In general, access revenue is
billed one month in advance and recognized when earned. Usage revenue is generally billed in arrears and recognized when service is rendered. Equipment sales
revenue associated with the sale of wireless devices and accessories is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as
this is considered to be a separate earnings process from providing wireless services. For agreements involving the resale of third-party services in which we are
considered the primary obligor in the arrangements, we record the revenue gross at the time of the sale.

Under the Verizon device payment program (formerly known as Verizon Edge), our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at unsubsidized prices
on an installment basis (a device installment plan). Certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down
the minimum percentage of the device installment plan and trading in their device. When a customer has the right to upgrade to a new device by paying down the
minimum percentage of the device installment plan and trading in their device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the
trade-in right’s fair value (not an allocated value) is recognized as a guarantee liability and the remaining allocable consideration is allocated to the device. The
value of the guarantee liability effectively results in a reduction to the revenue recognized for the sale of the device.

In multiple element arrangements that bundle devices and monthly wireless service, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting using a relative selling price
method. At the inception of the arrangement, the amount allocable to the delivered units of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the
delivery  of  the  monthly  wireless  service  (the  noncontingent  amount).  We  effectively  recognize  revenue  on  the  delivered  device  at  the  lesser  of  the  amount
allocated based on the relative selling price of the device or the noncontingent amount owed when the device is sold.

Wireline

Our Wireline segment earns revenue based upon usage of its network and facilities and contract fees. In general, fixed monthly fees for voice, video, data and
certain other services are billed one month in advance and recognized when earned. Revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and are based on usage is
generally billed in arrears and recognized when service is rendered.

We sell each of the services offered in bundled arrangements (i.e., voice, video and data), as well as separately; therefore each product or service has a standalone
selling price. For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each deliverable using a relative selling price method. Under this method, arrangement consideration
is allocated to each separate deliverable based on our standalone selling price for each product or service. These services include Fios services, individually or in
bundles, and High Speed Internet.

When  we  bundle  equipment  with  maintenance  and  monitoring  services,  we  recognize  equipment  revenue  when  the  equipment  is  installed  in  accordance  with
contractual specifications and ready for the customer’s use. The maintenance and monitoring services are recognized monthly over the term of the contract as we
provide the services.

Installation-related fees, along with the associated costs up to but not exceeding these fees, are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer relationship
period.

Other

Advertising  revenues  are  generated  through  display  advertising  and  search  advertising.  Display  advertising  revenue  is  generated  by  the  display  of  graphical
advertisements and other performance-based advertising. Search advertising revenue is generated when a consumer clicks on a text-based advertisement on their
screen.  Agreements  for  advertising  typically  take  the  forms  of  impression-based  contracts,  time-based  contracts  or  performance-based  contracts.  Advertising
revenues derived from impression-based contracts, in which we provide impressions in exchange for a fixed fee, are generally recognized as the impressions are
delivered. Advertising revenues derived from time-based contracts, in which we provide promotions over a specified time period for a fixed fee, are recognized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, provided that we meet and will continue to meet our obligations under the contract. Advertising revenues
derived from contracts where we are compensated based on certain performance criteria are recognized as we complete the contractually specified performance.

We report taxes imposed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions between us and our customers on a net basis.

Maintenance and Repairs

We charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services
as these costs are incurred.

Advertising Costs

Costs for advertising products and services as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the
periods in which they are incurred (see Note 15).

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per
common share include the dilutive effect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.

There were a total of approximately 8 million, 7 million and 8 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the
computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015,
there were no outstanding options to purchase shares that would have been anti-dilutive. Outstanding options to purchase shares that were not included in the
computation  of  diluted  earnings  per  common  share,  because  to  do  so  would  have  been  anti-dilutive  for  the  period,  were  not  significant  for  the  years  ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

On January 28, 2014, at a special meeting of our shareholders, we received shareholder approval to increase our authorized shares of common stock by 2 billion
shares to an aggregate of 6.25 billion authorized shares of common stock. On February 4, 2014, this authorization became effective. On February 21, 2014, we
issued approximately 1.27 billion shares of common stock upon completing the acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc’s indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership
d/b/a Verizon Wireless. See Note 2 for additional information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates quoted market value and include amounts held in money market funds.

Marketable Securities

We  have  investments  in  marketable  securities,  which  are  considered  “available-for-sale”  under  the  provisions  of  the  accounting  standard  for  certain  debt  and
equity  securities,  and  are  included  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  Short-term  investments  or  Other  assets.  We  continually  evaluate  our
investments in marketable securities for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other-than-temporary. That evaluation includes, in addition
to persistent, declining stock prices, general economic and company-specific evaluations. In the event of a determination that a decline in market value is other-
than-temporary, a charge to earnings is recorded for the loss, and a new cost basis in the investment is established.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost net of an allowance for credit losses. We maintain allowances for uncollectible
accounts  receivable,  including  our  device  installment  plan  receivables,  for  estimated  losses  resulting  from  the  failure  or  inability  of  our  customers  to  make
required payments. Similar to traditional service revenue accounting treatment, we record device installment plan bad debt expense based on an estimate of the
percentage of equipment revenue that will not be collected. This estimate is based on a number of factors including historical write-off experience, credit quality
of the customer base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions. Due to the device installment plan being incorporated in the standard Verizon Wireless
bill, the collection and risk strategies continue to follow historical practices. We monitor the aging of our accounts with device installment plan receivables and
write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely.

Inventories

Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-
in, first-out basis) or market.

Plant and Depreciation

We record plant, property and equipment at cost. Plant, property and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis.

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the
time the asset was placed in service.

When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the plant accounts, and any gains
or losses on disposition are recognized in income.

We capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed along with related plant assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition
or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-
related assets.

In  connection  with  our  ongoing  review  of  the  estimated  remaining  average  useful  lives  of  plant,  property  and  equipment,  we  determined  that  changes  were
necessary  to  the  remaining  estimated  useful  lives  of  certain  assets  as  a  result  of  technology  upgrades,  enhancements,  and  planned  retirements.  These  changes
resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. While the timing and extent of current deployment
plans are subject to ongoing analysis and modification, we believe the current estimates of useful lives are reasonable.

Computer Software Costs

We  capitalize  the  cost  of  internal-use  network  and  non-network  software  that  has  a  useful  life  in  excess  of  one  year.  Subsequent  additions,  modifications  or
upgrades to internal-use network and non-network software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not
perform. Planning, software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Also, we capitalize interest associated with the
development of internal-use network and non-network software. Capitalized non-network internal-use software costs are amortized using the straight-line method
over a period of 3 to 8 years and are included in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of our impairment policy for
capitalized  software  costs,  see  “Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets”  below.  Also,  see  Note  3  for  additional  detail  of  internal-use  non-network  software
reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed
annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we have the option
to  perform  a  qualitative  assessment.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment  and  perform  an  impairment  test  even  if  no  indications  of  a
potential impairment exist. The impairment test for goodwill uses a two-step approach, which is performed at the reporting unit level. Step one, performed to
identify  potential  impairment,  compares  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  (calculated  using  a  market  approach  and/or  a  discounted  cash  flow  method)  to  its
carrying  value.  If  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value,  there  is  a  potential  impairment  and  step  two  must  be  performed  to  measure  the  amount  of  the
impairment charge. Step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its implied fair value (i.e., fair value of reporting unit less the fair
value of the unit’s assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets). If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill,
an impairment charge is recognized.

Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization

A  significant  portion  of  our  intangible  assets  are  wireless  licenses  that  provide  our  wireless  operations  with  the  exclusive  right  to  utilize  designated  radio
frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to
renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that
there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat
the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We reevaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events
and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life.

We test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a
qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment
in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. The most recent quantitative assessment of our wireless licenses occurred in
2015. Our quantitative assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the
test date. Using a quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach
is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that
goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant
would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less
than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses then an impairment charge is recognized. In 2014 and 2013, we performed a qualitative assessment
to  determine  whether  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  our  wireless  licenses  was  less  than  the  carrying  amount.  As  part  of  our  assessment,  we
considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our Wireless segment, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest
rates  and  discount  rates),  industry  and  market  considerations  (including  industry  revenue  and  EBITDA  (Earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and
amortization) margin projections), the projected financial performance of our Wireless segment, as well as other factors.

Interest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The
capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially complete and the license is ready for its intended use.

Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets

Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful
lives. All of our intangible assets subject to amortization and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications were present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount
of  the  asset  group  to  the  net  undiscounted  cash  flows  expected  to  be  generated  from  the  asset  group.  If  those  net  undiscounted  cash  flows  do  not  exceed  the
carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We reevaluate the useful life
determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.

For information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives
of our other acquired intangible assets, see Note 3.

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the
inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:

Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3—No observable pricing inputs in the market

Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our
assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities
being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy.

Income Taxes

Our  effective  tax  rate  is  based  on  pre-tax  income,  statutory  tax  rates,  tax  laws  and  regulations  and  tax  planning  strategies  available  to  us  in  the  various
jurisdictions in which we operate.

Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the bases between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income
taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates then in effect. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than
not to be realized.

We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine
whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position
will  be  examined  by  the  appropriate  taxing  authority  that  has  full  knowledge  of  all  relevant  information.  The  second  step  is  measurement:  a  tax  position  that
meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is
measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken
in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes
payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset, or an increase in a deferred tax liability.

The accounting standard relating to income taxes generated by leveraged lease transactions requires that changes in the projected timing of income tax cash flows
generated by a leveraged lease transaction be recognized as a gain or loss in the year in which the change occurs.

Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See
Note 10 for further details.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign entities, we translate income statement amounts at average
exchange  rates  for  the  period,  and  we  translate  assets  and  liabilities  at  end-of-period  exchange  rates.  We  record  these  translation  adjustments  in  Accumulated
other comprehensive income, a separate component of Equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. We report exchange gains and losses on intercompany foreign
currency transactions of a long-term nature in Accumulated other comprehensive income. Other exchange gains and losses are reported in income.

Employee Benefit Plans

Pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year as well as interest on projected benefit obligations are accrued currently.
Prior  service  costs  and  credits  resulting  from  changes  in  plan  benefits  are  generally  amortized  over  the  average  remaining  service  period  of  the  employees
expected  to  receive  benefits.  Expected  return  on  plan  assets  is  determined  by  applying  the  return  on  assets  assumption  to  the  actual  fair  value  of  plan  assets.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or
upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the company retiree medical subsidy (see
Note 11).

We  recognize  a  pension  or  a  postretirement  plan’s  funded  status  as  either  an  asset  or  liability  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Also,  we  measure  any
unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
tax.

Derivative Instruments

We enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity and commodity
prices.  We  employ  risk  management  strategies,  which  may  include  the  use  of  a  variety  of  derivatives  including  cross  currency  swaps,  foreign  currency  and
prepaid  forwards  and  collars,  interest  rate  swap  agreements,  commodity  swap  and  forward  agreements  and  interest  rate  locks.  We  do  not  hold  derivatives  for
trading purposes.

We measure all derivatives, including derivatives embedded in other financial instruments, at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms
of  our  derivative  contracts  and  thus  are  classified  as  Level  2.  Changes  in  the  fair  values  of  derivative  instruments  not  qualifying  as  hedges  or  any  ineffective
portion of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments used effectively as fair value hedges are
recognized  in  earnings,  along  with  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged  item.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  effective  portions  of  cash  flow  hedges  are
reported  in  Other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  and  recognized  in  earnings  when  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the
effective  portion  of  net  investment  hedges  of  certain  of  our  foreign  operations  are  reported  in  Other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  as  part  of  the  cumulative
translation adjustment and partially offset the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment.

Variable Interest Entities

VIEs are entities which lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, have
equity investors which do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to
absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are
deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party which has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic
performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

During the first quarter of 2015, we adopted the accounting standard update related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of
components of an entity, which changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. As a result of this standard update, a disposal of a component of an
entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a
major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. The prospective adoption of this standard update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  we  early  adopted  the  accounting  standard  update  related  to  the  balance  sheet  classification  of  deferred  taxes.  The  standard
update  requires  that  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  be  classified  as  noncurrent  in  the  statement  of  financial  position.  We  applied  the  amendments  in  this
accounting standard update retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this standard update did not have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2015, the accounting standard update related to the simplification of the accounting for measurement-period adjustments in business combinations
was  issued.  This  standard  update  requires  an  acquirer  to  recognize  measurement-period  adjustments  in  the  reporting  period  in  which  the  adjustments  are
determined  and  to  record  the  effects  on  earnings  of  any  changes  resulting  from  the  change  in  provisional  amounts,  calculated  as  if  the  accounting  had  been
completed at the acquisition date. We will adopt this standard update during the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have
a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2015, the accounting standard update related to disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share was issued. This
standard update removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value
per share practical expedient. The standard update also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at
fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. We will adopt this standard update during the first quarter of 2016 and apply it retrospectively to
all periods presented. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the accounting standard update related to the simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs was issued. This standard update requires that
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. In
August  2015,  the  accounting  standard  update  related  to  the  presentation  and  subsequent  measurement  of  debt  issuance  costs  associated  with  line-of-credit
arrangements was issued. This standard adds Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paragraphs pursuant to an SEC Staff Announcement that the SEC staff
would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the
costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. We will adopt these standard updates during the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of these standard updates is not
expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In  June  2014,  an  accounting  standard  update  was  issued  related  to  the  accounting  for  share-based  payments  when  the  terms  of  an  award  provide  that  a
performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The standard update requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could
be  achieved  after  the  requisite  service  period  be  treated  as  a  performance  condition.  We  will  adopt  this  standard  update  during  the  first  quarter  of  2016.  The
adoption of this standard update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the accounting standard update related to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers was issued. This standard update clarifies the
principles  for  recognizing  revenue  and  develops  a  common  revenue  standard  for  U.S.  GAAP  and  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  The  standard
update  intends  to  provide  a  more  robust  framework  for  addressing  revenue  issues;  improve  comparability  of  revenue  recognition  practices  across  entities,
industries,  jurisdictions,  and  capital  markets;  and  provide  more  useful  information  to  users  of  financial  statements  through  improved  disclosure  requirements.
Upon adoption of this standard update, we expect that the allocation and timing of revenue recognition will be impacted. In August 2015, an accounting standard
update was issued that delays the effective date of this standard until the first quarter of 2018. Companies are permitted to early adopt the standard in the first
quarter of 2017.

There are two adoption methods available for implementation of the standard update related to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under
one method, the guidance is applied retrospectively to contracts for each reporting period presented, subject to allowable practical expedients. Under the other
method, the guidance is applied only to the most current period presented, recognizing the cumulative effect of the change as an adjustment to the beginning
balance of retained earnings, and also requires additional disclosures comparing the results to the previous guidance. We are currently evaluating these adoption
methods and the impact that this standard update will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Wireless

Wireless Transaction

On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) with Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) and Vodafone 4
Limited (Seller), pursuant to which Verizon agreed to acquire Vodafone’s indirect 45% interest in Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless (the Partnership, and
such interest, the Vodafone Interest) for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion.

On February 21, 2014, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired (the Wireless Transaction)
from Seller all of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the Transferred Shares) of Vodafone Americas Finance 1 Inc., a subsidiary of Seller (VF1 Inc.), which
indirectly through certain subsidiaries (together with VF1 Inc., the Purchased Entities) owned the Vodafone Interest. In consideration for the Transferred Shares,
upon completion of the Wireless Transaction, Verizon (i) paid approximately $58.89 billion in cash, (ii) issued approximately 1.27 billion shares of Verizon’s
common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the Stock Consideration), which was valued at approximately $61.3 billion at the closing of the Wireless Transaction,
(iii)  issued  senior  unsecured  Verizon  notes  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $5.0  billion  (the  Verizon  Notes),  (iv)  sold  Verizon’s  indirectly  owned  23.1%
interest in Vodafone Omnitel N.V. (Omnitel, and such interest, the Omnitel Interest), valued at $3.5 billion and (v) provided other consideration, which included
the assumption of preferred stock valued at approximately $1.7 billion. The total cash paid to Vodafone and the other costs of the Wireless Transaction, including
financing, legal and bank fees, were financed through the incurrence of third-party indebtedness. See Note 7 for additional information.

In accordance with the accounting standard on consolidation, a change in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains a controlling financial interest in
its subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and remeasurement of assets and liabilities of previously controlled and consolidated subsidiaries is not
permitted. As a result, we accounted for the Wireless Transaction by adjusting the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest to reflect the change in Verizon’s
ownership  interest  in  the  Partnership.  Any  difference  between  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  paid  and  the  amount  by  which  the  noncontrolling  interest  is
adjusted has been recognized in equity attributable to Verizon.

Omnitel Transaction

On  February  21,  2014,  Verizon  and  Vodafone  also  consummated  the  sale  of  the  Omnitel  Interest  (the  Omnitel  Transaction)  by  a  subsidiary  of  Verizon  to  a
subsidiary of Vodafone in connection with the Wireless Transaction pursuant to a separate share purchase agreement. As a result, during 2014, we recognized a
pre-tax gain of $1.9 billion on the disposal of the Omnitel interest in Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated businesses on our consolidated statement of
income.

Verizon Notes (Non-Cash Transaction)

The Verizon Notes were issued pursuant to Verizon’s existing indenture. The Verizon Notes were issued in two separate series, with $2.5 billion due February 21,
2022 (the eight-year Verizon Notes) and $2.5 billion due February 21, 2025 (the eleven-year Verizon Notes). The Verizon Notes bear interest at a floating rate,
which will be reset quarterly, with interest payable quarterly in arrears, beginning May 21, 2014. The eight-year Verizon notes bear interest at a floating rate equal
to  three-month  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR),  plus  1.222%,  and  the  eleven-year  Verizon  notes  bear  interest  at  a  floating  rate  equal  to  three-month
LIBOR, plus 1.372%. The indenture that governs the Verizon Notes contains certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant and a merger or
similar  transaction  covenant,  affirmative  covenants  and  events  of  default  that  are  customary  for  companies  maintaining  an  investment  grade  credit  rating.  An
event of default for either series of the Verizon Notes may result in acceleration of the entire principal amount of all debt securities of that series. Beginning two
years after the closing of the Wireless Transaction,

Verizon may redeem all or any portion of the outstanding Verizon Notes held by Vodafone or any of its affiliates for a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Verizon Notes may only be transferred by Vodafone to third parties in specified amounts during specified periods,
commencing January 1, 2017. Any Verizon Notes held by third parties will not be redeemable by Verizon prior to their maturity dates. Verizon has agreed to file a
registration statement with respect to the Verizon Notes at least three months prior to the Verizon Notes becoming transferable.

Other Consideration (Non-Cash Transaction)

Included  in  the  other  consideration  provided  to  Vodafone  is  the  indirect  assumption  of  long-term  obligations  with  respect  to  5.143%  Class  D  and  Class  E
cumulative preferred stock (Preferred Stock) issued by one of the Purchased Entities. Both the Class D shares (825,000 shares outstanding) and Class E shares
(825,000  shares  outstanding)  are  mandatorily  redeemable  in  April  2020  at  $1,000  per  share  plus  any  accrued  and  unpaid  dividends.  Dividends  accrue  at
5.143% per annum and will be treated as interest expense. Both the Class D and Class E shares have been classified as liability instruments and were recorded at
fair value as determined at the closing of the Wireless Transaction.

Deferred Tax Liabilities

Certain deferred taxes directly attributable to the Wireless Transaction have been calculated based on an analysis of taxes attributable to the difference between
the  tax  basis  of  the  investment  in  the  noncontrolling  interest  that  is  assumed  compared  to  Verizon’s  book  basis.  As  a  result,  Verizon  recorded  a  deferred  tax
liability of approximately $13.5 billion.

Spectrum License Transactions

Since 2013, we have entered into several strategic spectrum transactions including:

•   During  the  first  quarter  of  2013,  we  completed  license  exchange  transactions  with  T-Mobile  License  LLC  and  Cricket  License  Company,  LLC,  a
subsidiary of Leap Wireless, to exchange certain Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) licenses. These non-cash exchanges included a number of intra-
market swaps that we expect will enable Verizon Wireless to make more efficient use of the AWS band. As a result of these exchanges, we received an
aggregate $0.5 billion of AWS licenses at fair value and recorded an immaterial gain.

•   During the third quarter of 2013, after receiving the required regulatory approvals, Verizon Wireless sold 39 lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses
to AT&T Inc. (AT&T) in exchange for a payment of $1.9 billion and the transfer by AT&T to Verizon Wireless of AWS (10 MHz) licenses in certain
markets in the western United States. Verizon Wireless also sold certain lower 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses to an investment firm for a payment
of  $0.2  billion.  As  a  result,  we  received  $0.5  billion  of  AWS  licenses  at  fair  value  and  we  recorded  a  pre-tax  gain  of  approximately  $0.3  billion  in
Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013.

•   During the second quarter of 2014, we completed license exchange transactions with T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile USA) to exchange certain AWS and
Personal Communication Services (PCS) licenses. The exchange included a number of swaps that we expect will result in more efficient use of the AWS
and PCS bands. As a result of these exchanges, we received $0.9 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded an immaterial
gain.

•   During the second quarter of 2014, we completed transactions pursuant to two additional agreements with T-Mobile USA with respect to our remaining
700 MHz A block spectrum licenses. Under one agreement, we sold certain of these licenses to T-Mobile USA in exchange for cash consideration of
approximately $2.4 billion, and under the second agreement we exchanged the remainder of our 700 MHz A block spectrum licenses as well as AWS
and PCS spectrum licenses for AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a result, we received $1.6 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value
and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.7 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for
the year ended December 31, 2014.

•   During the third quarter of 2014, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum

licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in January 2015 at which time we recorded an immaterial gain.

•   On January 29, 2015, the FCC completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum, which it identified as the AWS-3 band. Verizon participated in that auction
and was the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we made a
deposit of $0.9 billion related to our participation in this auction which is classified within Other, net investing activities on our consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an application to the FCC and paid $9.5 billion to
the  FCC  to  complete  payment  for  these  licenses.  The  cash  payment  of  $9.5  billion  is  classified  within  Acquisitions  of  wireless  licenses  on  our
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015. On April 8, 2015, the FCC granted us these spectrum licenses.

•   During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a license exchange transaction with an affiliate of T-Mobile USA to exchange certain AWS and PCS
spectrum licenses. As a result we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately
$0.3 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.

•   During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum

licenses. This non-cash exchange is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2016 and we expect to record an immaterial gain.

•   During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of Sprint Corporation, which provides for the exchange of
certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016 and we expect to record an
immaterial gain.

Tower Monetization Transaction

During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive
rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the leases, American Tower has
exclusive rights to lease and operate the towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase
options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for
$0.1  billion.  We  have  subleased  capacity  on  the  towers  from American  Tower  for  a  minimum  of  10  years  at  current  market  rates,  with  options  to  renew.  The
upfront payment, including the towers sold, which is primarily included within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, is accounted for as deferred
rent  and  as  a  financing  obligation.  The  $2.4  billion  accounted  for  as  deferred  rent,  which  is  presented  within  Other,  net  cash  flows  provided  by  operating
activities, relates to the portion of the towers for which the right-of-use has passed to the tower operator. The $2.7 billion accounted for as a financing obligation,
which is presented within Other, net cash flows used in financing activities, relates to the portion of the towers that we continue to occupy and use for network
operations.

Other

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we acquired various other wireless licenses and markets for cash consideration that was not significant. Additionally, during 2013,
we obtained control of previously unconsolidated wireless partnerships, which were previously accounted for under the equity method and are now consolidated,
which resulted in an immaterial gain. In 2013, we recorded $0.2 billion of goodwill as a result of these transactions.

Wireline

Access Line Sale

On February 5, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which
Verizon will sell its local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched
and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.5
billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction,
which includes the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, does
not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in Verizon’s continuing operations and
classified as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. For the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, these businesses generated approximately $5.4 billion of revenues, excluding revenues with affiliates, for each respective year and
operating income of approximately $0.8 billion and an immaterial loss, respectively, based on the stand-alone financial results of the businesses. These amounts
include direct expenses incurred of approximately $2.7 billion in each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and (credits) charges related to pension
and  benefit  actuarial  valuation  adjustments  for  these  ILEC  employees  of  $(0.2)  billion  and  $0.6  billion  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2015  and  2014,
respectively. The amounts also include indirect overhead expenses, which are a significant component of our cost structure. These stand-alone financial results
also  include  approximately  $1.0  billion  of  depreciation  and  amortization  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  respectively.  In  our  consolidated
results, the depreciation and amortization of these ILEC assets ceased at the beginning of 2015 in accordance with the accounting model for assets held for sale.
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions including, among others, receipt of federal approvals from the FCC and the antitrust
authorities and state regulatory approvals. All federal and state regulatory approvals have been obtained. We expect this transaction to close at the end of the first
quarter of 2016.

Based on the number of voice connections and Fios Internet and video subscribers, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, the transaction would result in Frontier
acquiring approximately 3.4 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses
from Verizon. The operating results of these businesses, collectively, are included within our Wireline segment for all periods presented.

The following table summarizes the major classes of assets and liabilities of our local exchange and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas
which are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015:

On July 1, 2014, we sold a non-strategic Wireline business that provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies for net cash proceeds of
$0.1 billion and recorded an immaterial gain.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Verizon completed a sale of real estate for which we received total gross proceeds of $0.2 billion and recognized an immaterial
deferred  gain.  The  proceeds  received  as  a  result  of  this  transaction  have  been  classified  within  Cash  flows  used  in  investing  activities  on  our  consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Other

Acquisition of AOL Inc.

On May 12, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender
offer  to  acquire  all  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock  of  AOL  at  a  price  of  $50.00  per  share,  net  to  the  seller  in  cash,  without  interest  and  less  any
applicable withholding taxes.

On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by
Verizon at the closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware
law. If they had not exercised these rights, Verizon would have paid an additional $330 million for such shares at the closing.

AOL is a leader in the digital content and advertising platform space. Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital
content and advertising. AOL’s business model aligns with this approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a
digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams.

The acquisition of AOL has been accounted for as a business combination. The identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are finalized and we
are  in  the  process  of  finalizing  our  valuations  for  deferred  taxes.  These  adjustments  are  not  expected  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial
statements. The valuations will be finalized within 12 months following the close of the acquisition.

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the income, cost and market approaches. The fair value measurements were
primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined

in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, other than long-term debt assumed in the acquisition. The income approach was primarily used to value the
intangible assets, consisting primarily of acquired technology and customer relationships. The income approach indicates value for an asset based on the present
value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving
the  cash  flow  and  the  time  value  of  money.  The  cost  approach,  which  estimates  value  by  determining  the  current  cost  of  replacing  an  asset  with  another  of
equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for plant, property and equipment. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or
replacement cost for the property, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.

The following table summarizes the consideration to AOL’s shareholders and the identification of the assets acquired, including cash acquired of $0.5 billion, and
liabilities assumed as of the close of the acquisition, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date of AOL’s noncontrolling interests:

Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The
goodwill recorded as a result of the AOL transaction represents future economic benefits we expect to achieve as a result of combining the operations of AOL and
Verizon  as  well  as  assets  acquired  that  could  not  be  individually  identified  and  separately  recognized.  The  preliminary  goodwill  related  to  this  acquisition  is
included within Corporate and other (see Note 3 for additional details).

Pro Forma Information

If  the  acquisition  of  AOL  had  been  completed  as  of  January  1,  2014,  our  results  of  operations,  including  Operating  revenues  and  Net  income  attributable  to
Verizon, would not have been materially different from our previously reported results of operations.

Real Estate Transaction

On May 19, 2015, Verizon consummated a sale-leaseback transaction with a financial services firm for the buildings and real estate at our Basking Ridge, New
Jersey location. We received total gross proceeds of $0.7 billion resulting in a deferred gain of $0.4 billion, which will be amortized over the initial leaseback
term of twenty years. The leaseback of the buildings and real estate is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result of this transaction
have been classified within Cash flows used in investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Other

On  September  3,  2015,  AOL  announced  an  agreement  to  acquire  an  advertising  technology  business  for  cash  consideration  that  was  not  significant.  The
transaction was completed in October 2015.

On  October  7,  2014,  Redbox  Instant  by  Verizon,  a  venture  between  Verizon  and  Redbox  Automated  Retail,  LLC  (Redbox),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
Outerwall  Inc.,  ceased  providing  service  to  its  customers.  In  accordance  with  an  agreement  between  the  parties,  Redbox  withdrew  from  the  venture  on
October 20, 2014 and Verizon wound down and dissolved the venture during the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of the termination of the venture, we recorded
a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.

During  February  2014,  Verizon  acquired  a  business  dedicated  to  the  development  of  Internet  Protocol  (IP)  television  for  cash  consideration  that  was  not
significant.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, Verizon acquired an industry leader in content delivery networks for $0.4 billion. Upon closing, we recorded $0.3 billion of
goodwill.  Additionally,  we  acquired  a  technology  company  for  cash  consideration  that  was  not  significant.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the
results of the operations of each of these acquisitions from the date each acquisition closed.

On February 20, 2016, Verizon entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings’ wireline business which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-
based  IP  and  Ethernet  networks  outside  of  Verizon’s  footprint  for  approximately  $1.8  billion,  subject  to  adjustment.  The  transaction  is  subject  to  customary
regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2017. Separately, Verizon entered into an agreement to lease certain wireless spectrum from XO
Holdings and has an option to buy XO Holdings’ entity that owns its wireless spectrum exercisable under certain circumstances.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately $10.4 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, of wireless licenses were under development for commercial service
for which we were capitalizing interest costs. The increase is primarily due to licenses acquired in the AWS-3 auction.

The average remaining renewal period of our wireless license portfolio was 5.6 years as of December 31, 2015. See Note 1 for additional details.

As a result of the acquisition of AOL in the second quarter of 2015, we recognized preliminary Goodwill of $1.9 billion, which is included within Other (see Note
2 for additional details). We also allocated $0.6 billion of goodwill on a relative fair value basis from Wireline to Other as a result of an internal reorganization.
This increase was partially offset by a decrease in Goodwill in Wireline primarily due to the reclassification of $1.3 billion of Goodwill to Non-current assets held
for sale on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 as a result of our agreement to sell our local exchange business and related landline activities in
California, Florida and Texas to Frontier (see Note 2 for additional details). The amount of Goodwill reclassified was based on a relative fair value basis.

Investments in Unconsolidated Businesses

Equity Method Investments

Vodafone Omnitel

Vodafone Omnitel N.V. (Vodafone Omnitel) is one of the largest wireless communications companies in Italy. Prior to the completion of the Wireless Transaction
on February 21, 2014, Verizon held a 23.1% ownership interest in Vodafone Omnitel. As part of the consideration of the Wireless Transaction, a subsidiary of
Verizon sold its entire ownership interest in Vodafone Omnitel to a subsidiary of Vodafone on February 21, 2014. See Note 2 for additional information.

Other Equity and Cost Investees

The  remaining  investments  include  wireless  partnerships  in  the  U.S.,  limited  partnership  investments  in  entities  that  invest  in  affordable  housing  projects  and
other smaller domestic and international investments.

Summarized Financial Information

The  financial  information  for  our  equity  method  investees  in  2015  and  2014,  including  Vodafone  Omnitel  through  the  closing  of  the  Wireless  Transaction  in
February 2014, was not significant and therefore is not reflected in the table below.

We are the lessor in leveraged and direct financing lease agreements for commercial aircraft and power generating facilities, which comprise the majority of our
leasing portfolio along with telecommunications equipment, commercial real estate property and other equipment. These leases have remaining terms of up to 23
years as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we lease space on certain of our cell towers to other wireless carriers. Minimum lease payments receivable represent
unpaid rentals, less principal and interest on third-party nonrecourse debt relating to leveraged lease transactions. Since we have no general liability for this debt,
which is secured by a senior security interest in the leased equipment and rentals, the related principal and interest have been offset against the minimum lease
payments. All recourse debt is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.

At each reporting period, we monitor the credit quality of the various lessees in our portfolios. Regarding the leveraged lease portfolio, external credit reports are
used where available and where not available we use internally developed indicators. These indicators or internal credit risk grades factor historic loss experience,
the value of the underlying collateral, delinquency trends, and industry and general economic conditions. The credit quality of our lessees varies from A to CCC+.
For each reporting period, the leveraged leases within the portfolio are reviewed for indicators of impairment where it is probable the rent due according to the
contractual terms of the lease will not be collected. All significant accounts, individually or in the aggregate, are current and none are classified as impaired.

Finance lease receivables, which are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, are comprised of the following:

We lease certain facilities and equipment for use in our operations under both capital and operating leases. Total rent expense under operating leases amounted to
$3.2 billion in 2015, $2.7 billion in 2014 and $2.6 billion in 2013, respectively.

During  March  2015,  we  completed  a  transaction  with  American  Tower  pursuant  to  which  American  Tower  acquired  the  exclusive  rights  to  lease  and  operate
approximately  11,300  of  our  wireless  towers  for  an  upfront  payment  of  $5.0  billion.  We  have  subleased  capacity  on  the  towers  from  American  Tower  for  a
minimum  of  10  years  at  current  market  rates,  with  options  to  renew.  Under  this  agreement,  total  rent  payments  amounted  to  $0.2  billion  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2015. We expect to make minimum future lease payments of approximately $2.6 billion. We continue to include the towers in Plant, property and
equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December 31, 2015, $0.5 billion of towers were included in Plant, property

February Exchange Offers

On  February  11,  2015,  we  announced  the  commencement  of  seven  separate  private  offers  to  exchange  (the  February  Exchange  Offers)  specified  series  of
outstanding notes and debentures issued by Verizon and GTE Corporation (collectively, the Old Notes) for new Notes to be issued by Verizon (the New Notes)
and, in the case of the 6.94% debentures due 2028 of GTE Corporation, cash. The February Exchange Offers have been accounted for as a modification of debt.
On March 13, 2015, Verizon issued $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.272% Notes due 2036 (the 2036 New Notes), $5.0 billion aggregate principal
amount  of  4.522%  Notes  due  2048  (the  2048  New  Notes)  and  $5.5  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  4.672%  Notes  due  2055  (the  2055  New  Notes)  in
satisfaction of the exchange offer consideration on tendered Old Notes (not including accrued and unpaid interest on the Old Notes). The following tables list the

During the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a term loan agreement with a major financial institution, pursuant to which we borrowed $6.5 billion for general
corporate purposes, including the acquisition of spectrum licenses. Borrowings under the term loan agreement were to mature in March 2016, with a $4.0 billion
mandatory prepayment required in June 2015. The term loan agreement contained certain negative covenants, including a negative pledge covenant, a merger or
similar transaction covenant and an accounting changes covenant, affirmative covenants and events of default that are customary for companies maintaining an
investment grade credit rating. In addition, the term loan agreement required us to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) not in excess
of 3.50:1.00, until our credit ratings were equal to or higher than A3 and A- at Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, respectively.

During March 2015, we prepaid approximately $5.0 billion of the term loan agreement, which satisfied the mandatory prepayment. During the third and fourth
quarters of 2015, respectively, we made repayments of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.5 billion. As of December 31, 2015, no amounts remained outstanding
under the term loan agreement.

Other

During June 2015, as part of the Merger Agreement with AOL, we assumed approximately $0.6 billion of debt and capital lease obligations. As of December 31,
2015, approximately $0.4 billion of the assumed debt and capital lease obligations were repaid.

During October 2015, we executed a $0.2 billion, 1.5% loan due 2018. Also, during March 2015, $0.5 billion of floating rate Verizon Communications Notes
matured and were repaid. During November 2015, $1.0 billion of 0.7% Verizon Communications Notes matured and were repaid.

2014

During February 2014, we issued €1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Notes due 2022, €1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Notes
due 2026 and £0.85 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Notes due 2034. The issuance of these Notes resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $5.4
billion,  net  of  discounts  and  issuance  costs.  The  net  proceeds  were  used,  in  part,  to  finance  the  Wireless  Transaction.  Net  proceeds  not  used  to  finance  the
Wireless Transaction were used for general corporate purposes. Also, during February 2014, we issued $0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.90% Notes
due 2054 resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $0.5 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

During March 2014, we issued $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed and floating rate notes resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $4.5 billion,
net of discounts and issuance costs. The issuances consisted of the following: $0.5 billion aggregate principal amount Floating Rate Notes due 2019 that bear
interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.77% which rate will be reset quarterly, $0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.55% Notes due 2019,
$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.45% Notes due 2021, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.15% Notes due 2024 and $1.25 billion aggregate
principal amount of 5.05% Notes due 2034. During March 2014, the net proceeds were used to purchase notes in the Tender Offer described below.

Also, during March 2014, $1.0 billion of LIBOR plus 0.61% Verizon Communications Notes and $1.5 billion of 1.95% Verizon Communications Notes matured
and were repaid.

During September 2014, we issued $0.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.8% Notes due 2044. The issuance of these Notes resulted in cash proceeds of
approximately $0.9 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Also, during September 2014, we
redeemed  $0.8  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon  1.25%  Notes  due  November  2014  and  recorded  an  immaterial  amount  of  early  debt  redemption
costs.

During  October  2014,  we  issued  $6.5  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  fixed  rate  notes.  The  issuance  of  these  notes  resulted  in  cash  proceeds  of
approximately $6.4 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs and after reimbursement of certain expenses. The issuance consisted of the following: $1.5 billion
aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Notes due 2021, $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Notes due 2024, and $2.5 billion aggregate principal
amount of 4.40% Notes due 2034. The net proceeds from the issuance was used to redeem (i) in whole the following series of outstanding notes which were
called  for  early  redemption  in  November  2014  (collectively,  November  Early  Debt  Redemption):  $0.5  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon
Communications 4.90% Notes due 2015 at 103.7% of the principal amount of such notes, $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon Communications

notes;  and  (ii)  $1.0  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon  Communications  2.50%  Notes  due  2016  at  103.0%  of  the  principal  amount  of  such  notes.
Proceeds not used for the redemption of these notes were used for general corporate purposes. Any accrued and unpaid interest was paid to the date of redemption
(see “Early Debt Redemption and Other Costs”).

During December 2014, we issued €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.625% Notes due 2024 and €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.625%
Notes due 2031. The issuance of these Notes resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $3.0 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs and after reimbursement
of certain expenses. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

Verizon Notes (Non-Cash Transaction)

During February 2014, in connection with the Wireless Transaction, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes. The Verizon Notes
were issued in two separate series, with $2.5 billion due February 21, 2022 and $2.5 billion due February 21, 2025. The Verizon Notes bear interest at a floating
rate, which will be reset quarterly, with interest payable quarterly in arrears, beginning May 21, 2014 (see Note 2). The eight-year Verizon notes bear interest at a
floating  rate  equal  to  three-month  LIBOR,  plus  1.222%,  and  the  eleven-year  Verizon  notes  bear  interest  at  a  floating  rate  equal  to  three-month  LIBOR,  plus
1.372%.

Preferred Stock (Non-Cash Transaction)

As a result of the Wireless Transaction, we assumed long-term obligations with respect to 5.143% Class D and Class E cumulative Preferred Stock issued by one
of the Purchased Entities. Both the Class D shares (825,000 shares outstanding) and Class E shares (825,000 shares outstanding) are mandatorily redeemable in
April 2020 at $1,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends accrue at 5.143% per annum and will be treated as interest expense. Both the
Class D and Class E shares have been classified as liability instruments and were recorded at fair value as determined at the closing of the Wireless Transaction.

Term Loan Agreement

During February 2014, we drew $6.6 billion pursuant to a term loan agreement, which was entered into during October 2013, with a group of major financial
institutions to finance, in part, the Wireless Transaction. $3.3 billion of the loans under the term loan agreement had a maturity of three years (the 3-Year Loans)
and $3.3 billion of the loans under the term loan agreement had a maturity of five years (the 5-Year Loans). The 5-Year Loans provide for the partial amortization
of  principal  during  the  last  two  years  that  they  are  outstanding.  Loans  under  the  term  loan  agreement  bear  interest  at  floating  rates.  The  term  loan  agreement
contains  certain  negative  covenants,  including  a  negative  pledge  covenant,  a  merger  or  similar  transaction  covenant  and  an  accounting  changes  covenant,
affirmative covenants and events of default that are customary for companies maintaining an investment grade credit rating. In addition, the term loan agreement
requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) not in excess of 3.50:1.00, until our credit ratings are equal to or higher than A3
and A- at Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, respectively.

During June 2014, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed and floating rate notes resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $3.3 billion, net
of discounts and issuance costs. The issuances consisted of the following: $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2017 that will bear
interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.40% which will be reset quarterly and $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.35% Notes due 2017. We
used the net proceeds from the offering of these notes to repay the 3-Year Loans on June 12, 2014.

During July 2014, we amended the term loan agreement, settled the outstanding $3.3 billion of 5-Year Loans and borrowed $3.3 billion of new loans. The new
loans mature in July 2019, bear interest at a lower interest rate and require lower amortization payments in 2017 and 2018. In connection with the transaction,
which  primarily  settled  on  a  net  basis,  we  recorded  approximately  $0.5  billion  of  proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings  and  of  repayments  of  long-term
borrowings, respectively.

Tender Offer

On March 10, 2014, we announced the commencement of a tender offer (the Tender Offer) to purchase for cash any and all of the series of notes listed in the

expired on March 17, 2014 and settled on March 19, 2014. In addition to the purchase price, any accrued and unpaid interest on the purchased notes was paid to
the date of purchase. During March 2014, we recorded early debt redemption costs in connection with the Tender Offer (see “Early Debt Redemption and Other
Costs”).

May Exchange Offer

On May 29, 2014, we announced the commencement of a private exchange offer (the May Exchange Offer) to exchange up to all Cellco Partnership and Verizon
Wireless  Capital  LLC’s  £0.6  billion  outstanding  aggregate  principal  amount  of  8.875%  Notes  due  2018  (the  2018  Old  Notes)  for  Verizon’s  new  sterling-
denominated Notes due 2024 (the New Notes) and an amount of cash. This exchange offer has been accounted for as a modification of debt. In connection with
the May Exchange Offer, which expired on June 25, 2014, we issued £0.7 billion aggregate principal of New Notes and made a cash payment of £22 million in
exchange for £0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of tendered 2018 Old Notes. The New Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.073% per annum.

Concurrent with the issuance of the New Notes, we entered into cross currency swaps to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars (see Note
9).

July Exchange Offers

On  July  23,  2014,  we  announced  the  commencement  of  eleven  separate  private  offers  to  exchange  (the  July  Exchange  Offers)  specified  series  of  outstanding
Notes  issued  by  Verizon  and  Alltel  Corporation  (collectively,  the  Old  Notes)  for  new  Notes  to  be  issued  by  Verizon.  The  July  Exchange  Offers  have  been
accounted for as a modification of debt. On August 21, 2014, Verizon issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Notes due 2020 (the 2020 New
Notes), $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.862% Notes due 2046 (the 2046 New Notes) and $5.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.012% Notes
due 2054 (the 2054 New Notes) in satisfaction of the exchange offer consideration on tendered Old Notes (not including accrued and unpaid interest on the Old
Notes). The following tables list the series of Old Notes included in the July Exchange Offers and the principal amount of each such series accepted by Verizon

Verizon Wireless – Notes Payable and Other

Verizon Wireless Capital LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon Wireless, is a limited liability company formed under the laws of Delaware on December 7,
2001  as  a  special  purpose  finance  subsidiary  to  facilitate  the  offering  of  debt  securities  of  Verizon  Wireless  by  acting  as  co-issuer.  Other  than  the  financing
activities as a co-issuer of Verizon Wireless indebtedness, Verizon Wireless Capital LLC has no material assets, operations or revenues. Verizon Wireless is jointly
and severally liable with Verizon Wireless Capital LLC for co-issued notes.

2015

During December 2015, we repaid $0.6 billion upon maturity for €0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC
8.750% Notes due 2015, and the related cross currency swap was settled.

2014

In addition to the retirements of debt securities in connection with the Tender Offer, the May Exchange Offer, the July Exchange Offers and the November Early
Debt  Redemption,  as  noted  above,  during  March  2014,  Verizon  Wireless  redeemed  $1.25  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Cellco  Partnership  and
Verizon  Wireless  Capital  LLC  8.50%  Notes  due  2018  at  127.135%  of  the  principal  amount  of  such  notes,  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  (see  “Early  Debt
Redemption and Other Costs”).

Telephone and Other Subsidiary Debt

2014

During 2014, a series of notes held by GTE Corporation was included in the Tender Offer described above.

Early Debt Redemption and Other Costs

During March 2014, we recorded net debt redemption costs of $0.9 billion in connection with the early redemption of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of
Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital LLC 8.50% Notes due 2018, and the purchase of the following notes pursuant to the Tender Offer: $0.7 billion of
the  then  outstanding  $1.5  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon  6.10%  Notes  due  2018,  $0.8  billion  of  the  then  outstanding  $1.5  billion  aggregate
principal amount of Verizon 5.50% Notes due 2018, $0.6 billion of the then outstanding $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 8.75% Notes due
2018, $0.7 billion of the then outstanding $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 5.55% Notes due 2016, $0.4 billion of the then outstanding $0.75
billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon  5.50%  Notes  due  2017,  $0.6  billion  of  the  then  outstanding  $1.0  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Cellco
Partnership  and  Verizon  Wireless  Capital  LLC  8.50%  Notes  due  2018,  $0.2  billion  of  the  then  outstanding  $0.3  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Alltel
Corporation 7.00% Debentures due 2016 and $0.3 billion of the then outstanding $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of GTE Corporation 6.84% Debentures
due 2018.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2014,  we  recorded  net  debt  redemption  costs  of  $0.5  billion  in  connection  with  the  early  redemption  of  $0.5  billion  aggregate
principal amount of Verizon 4.90% Notes due 2015, $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 5.55% Notes due 2016, $1.3 billion aggregate principal
amount of Verizon 3.00% Notes due 2016, $0.4 billion aggregate principal amount of Verizon 5.50% Notes due 2017, $0.7 billion aggregate principal amount of
Verizon  8.75%  Notes  due  2018,  $1.0  billion  of  the  then  outstanding  $3.2  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Verizon  2.50%  Notes  due  2016,  $0.1  billion
aggregate  principal  amount  Alltel  Corporation  7.00%  Debentures  due  2016  and  $0.4  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Cellco  Partnership  and  Verizon
Wireless Capital LLC 8.50% Notes due 2018, as well as $0.3 billion of other costs.

We recognize early debt redemption costs in Other income and (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.

Additional Financing Activities (Non-Cash Transaction)

We financed, primarily through vendor financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $0.7 billion of long-lived assets during 2015 and 2014, consisting
primarily  of  network  equipment.  At  December  31,  2015,  $0.9  billion  of  vendor  financing  arrangements  remained  outstanding.  These  purchases  are  non-cash
financing activities and therefore not reflected within Capital expenditures on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Guarantees

We  guarantee  the  debentures  and  first  mortgage  bonds  of  our  operating  telephone  company  subsidiaries.  As  of  December  31,  2015,  $3.1  billion  aggregate
principal amount of these obligations remained outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated pursuant to its
terms, including the operating telephone company no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon.

We  also  guarantee  the  debt  obligations  of  GTE  Corporation  that  were  issued  and  outstanding  prior  to  July  1,  2003.  As  of  December  31,  2015,  $1.4  billion
aggregate principal amount of these obligations remain outstanding.

Debt Covenants

We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our financial and restrictive covenants.

Maturities of Long-Term Debt

Maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Wireless Device Installment Plans

Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at unsubsidized prices on an installment basis (a device
installment plan). Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those under our
fixed-term service plans, and their installment charge is included in their standard wireless monthly bill. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the
total portfolio of device installment plan receivables we are servicing was $11.9 billion and $3.8 billion. During 2015, we entered into programs to sell certain
device installment receivables. The outstanding portfolio of device installment plan receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets but which we
continue to service was $8.2 billion at December 31, 2015.

At  the  time  of  sale,  we  impute  risk  adjusted  interest  on  the  device  installment  plan  receivables.  We  record  the  imputed  interest  as  a  reduction  to  the  related
accounts  receivable.  Interest  income,  which  is  included  within  Service  revenues  and  other  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  income,  is  recognized  over  the
financed installment term.

We assess the collectability of our device installment plan receivables based upon a variety of factors, including the credit quality of the customer base, payment
trends and other qualitative factors. We use custom, empirical, risk models to measure the credit quality of a customer and determine eligibility for the device
payment program. Based upon the risk assessed by the models, a customer may be required to provide a down payment to enter into the program and may be
subject to lower limits on the total amount financed. The down payment will vary in accordance with the risk assessed. We update our risk assessments monthly
based on payment trends and other qualitative factors in order to monitor the overall quality of our receivables. The credit quality of our customers is consistent
throughout the periods presented.

Customers  entering  into  device  installment  agreements  prior  to  May  31,  2015  have  the  right  to  upgrade  their  device,  subject  to  certain  conditions,  including
making a stated portion of the required device payments and trading in their device. Generally, customers entering into device installment agreements on or after
June  1,  2015  are  required  to  repay  all  amounts  due  under  their  device  installment  agreement  before  being  eligible  to  upgrade  their  device.  However,  certain
devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down the minimum percentage of their device installment plan
and trading in their device. When a customer is eligible to upgrade to a new device, we record a guarantee liability in accordance with our accounting policy. The
gross guarantee liability related to the upgrade program, which was approximately $0.2 billion at December 31, 2015 and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2014, was
primarily included in Other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Sales of Wireless Device Installment Plan Receivables

Wireless Device Installment Plan Receivables Purchase Agreement

During the first quarter of 2015, we established a program (Receivables Purchase Agreement, or RPA) to sell from time to time, on an uncommitted basis, eligible
device installment plan receivables to a group of primarily relationship banks (Purchasers). Under the program, we transfer the eligible receivables to wholly-
owned subsidiaries that are bankruptcy remote special purpose entities (Sellers or SPEs). The Sellers then sell the receivables to the Purchasers for upfront cash
proceeds  and  additional  consideration  upon  settlement  of  the  receivables  (the  deferred  purchase  price).  The  receivables  sold  under  the  program  are  no  longer
considered  assets  of  Verizon.  We  continue  to  bill  and  collect  on  the  receivables  in  exchange  for  a  monthly  servicing  fee,  which  is  not  material.  Eligible
receivables under the RPA exclude device installment plans where a customer was required to provide a down payment.

Revolving Sale of Wireless Device Installment Plan Receivables

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  we  entered  into  a  one-year  uncommitted  facility  to  sell  eligible  device  installment  plan  receivables  on  a  revolving  basis
(Revolving Program), subject to a maximum funding limit, to the Purchasers. Sales of eligible receivables by the Sellers, once initiated, generally occur and are
settled on a monthly basis. The receivables sold under the Revolving Program are no longer considered assets of Verizon. We continue to bill and collect on the
receivables in exchange for a monthly servicing fee, which is not material. Customer installment payments will be available to purchase eligible installment plan
receivables originated over the facility’s term. Eligible receivables under the Revolving Program exclude device installment plans where a customer was required
to provide a down payment.

The sales of receivables under the RPA and Revolving Program did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income. The cash proceeds
received from the Purchasers are recorded within Cash flows provided by operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

The following table provides a summary of device installment receivables sold under the RPA and the Revolving Program during the year ended December 31,
2015:

Variable Interest Entities

Under  both  the  RPA  and  the  Revolving  Program,  the  SPE’s  sole  business  consists  of  the  acquisition  of  the  receivables  from  Verizon  and  the  resale  of  the
receivables  to  the  Purchasers.  The  assets  of  the  SPEs  are  not  available  to  be  used  to  satisfy  obligations  of  any  Verizon  entities  other  than  the  Sellers.  We
determined that the SPEs are VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. Given that we have the power to direct the activities of the SPEs that
most significantly impact the SPE’s economic performance, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the SPEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and
liabilities of the SPEs into our consolidated financial statements.

Deferred Purchase Price

Under both the RPA and the Revolving Program, the deferred purchase price was initially recorded at fair value, based on the remaining installment amounts
expected to be collected, adjusted, as applicable, for the time value of money and by the timing and estimated value of the device trade-in. The estimated value of
the device trade-in considers prices expected to be offered to us by independent third parties. This estimate contemplates changes in value after the launch of a
device. The fair value measurements are considered to be Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The collection of the deferred purchase price is
contingent  on  collections  from  customers.  At  December  31,  2015,  our  deferred  purchase  price  receivable  was  $2.2  billion,  which  is  held  by  the  SPEs  and  is
included within Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.

Continuing Involvement

Verizon has continuing involvement with the sold receivables as it services the receivables. We continue to service the customer and their related receivables,
including facilitating customer payment collection, in exchange for a monthly servicing fee. While servicing the receivables, the same policies and procedures are
applied to the sold receivables that apply to owned receivables, and we continue to maintain normal relationships with

our customers. The credit quality of the customers we continue to service is consistent throughout the periods presented. During the year ended December 31,
2015, we have collected and remitted approximately $1.3 billion, net of fees, of which an immaterial amount was returned as deferred purchase price. During the
year ended December 31, 2015, credit losses on receivables sold were an immaterial amount.

In  addition,  we  have  continuing  involvement  related  to  the  sold  receivables  as  we  may  be  responsible  for  absorbing  additional  credit  losses  pursuant  to  the
agreements. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to the involvement with the SPEs is limited to the amount of the deferred purchase price, which
was  $2.2  billion  as  of  December  31,  2015.  The  maximum  exposure  to  loss  represents  an  estimated  loss  that  would  be  incurred  under  severe,  hypothetical
circumstances  whereby  the  Company  would  not  receive  the  portion  of  the  proceeds  withheld  by  the  Purchasers.  As  we  believe  the  probability  of  these
circumstances occurring is remote, the maximum exposure to loss is not an indication of the Company’s expected loss.

Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds as well as U.S. Treasury securities. We use quoted prices in active markets for our
U.S. Treasury securities, therefore these securities are classified as Level 1. For all other fixed income securities that do not have quoted prices in active markets,
we use alternative matrix pricing resulting in these debt securities being classified as Level 2.

Derivative  contracts  are  valued  using  models  based  on  readily  observable  market  parameters  for  all  substantial  terms  of  our  derivative  contracts  and  thus  are
classified within Level 2. We use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a
gross basis.

We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers within the fair value hierarchy
during 2015.

Fair Value of Short-term and Long-term Debt

The fair value of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical terms and maturities, which is a Level 1 measurement, as
well as quoted prices for similar terms and maturities in inactive markets and future cash flows discounted at current rates, which are Level 2 measurements. The
fair value of our short-term and long-term debt, excluding capital leases, was as follows:

We enter into domestic interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates based
on LIBOR, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against changes in the fair value
of our debt portfolio. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities.

During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $3.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into
interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $2.6 billion. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $7.6 billion
and $1.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was $0.1 billion at December 31, 2015 and was not material at December 31, 2014. The ineffective
portion of these interest rate swaps was not material at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Forward Interest Rate Swaps

In order to manage our exposure to future interest rate changes, we have entered into forward interest rate swaps. We designated these contracts as cash flow
hedges. At December 31, 2014, these swaps had a notional value of $2.0 billion. The fair value of these contracts was $0.2 billion at December 31, 2014, which
was included within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2015, we settled these forward interest rate swaps and the pre-
tax loss was not material. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into forward interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.8 billion. The fair value of
these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015.

Cross Currency Swaps

Verizon Wireless previously entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $1.6 billion of British Pound Sterling
and Euro-denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign
currency  transaction  gains  or  losses.  In  June  2014,  we  settled  $0.8  billion  of  these  cross  currency  swaps  and  the  gains  with  respect  to  these  swaps  were  not
material. In December 2015, we settled $0.6 billion of these cross currency swaps on maturity.

During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $5.4 billion of Euro and British
Pound Sterling denominated debt into U.S. dollars. During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to
exchange  approximately  $1.2  billion  of  British  Pound  Sterling  denominated  debt  into  U.S.  dollars.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2014,  we  entered  into  cross
currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange approximately $3.0 billion of Euro denominated debt into U.S. dollars and to fix our future interest
and principal payments in U.S. dollars. Each of these cross currency swaps was entered into in order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains
or losses.

A portion of the gains and losses recognized in Other comprehensive income was reclassified to Other income and (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax
foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying debt obligations. The fair value of the outstanding swaps was $1.6 billion and $0.6 billion, which was
primarily  included  within  Other  liabilities  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  at  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  respectively.  At  December  31,  2015,  the  total
notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $9.7 billion. During 2015 and 2014, a pre-tax loss of $1.2 billion and a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion, respectively,
was recognized in Other comprehensive income with respect to these swaps.

Net Investment Hedges

We entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar
net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into net investment hedges
with a total notional value of $0.9 billion with the contract tenor maturing in 2018. The fair value of these contracts was not material at December 31, 2015.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade
receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables, and derivative contracts. Our policy is to deposit our temporary cash investments with major
financial institutions. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are also major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA
master  agreement)  and  credit  support  annex  agreements  which  provide  rules  for  collateral  exchange.  We  generally  apply  collateralized  arrangements  with  our
counterparties  for  uncleared  derivatives  to  mitigate  credit  risk.  At  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  we  posted  collateral  of  approximately  $0.1  billion  and  $0.6
billion,  respectively,  related  to  derivative  contracts  under  collateral  exchange  arrangements,  which  were  recorded  as  Prepaid  expenses  and  other  in  our
consolidated balance sheets. During the first and second quarters of 2015, we paid an immaterial amount of cash to enter into amendments to certain collateral
exchange arrangements. These amendments suspend cash collateral posting for a specified period of time by both counterparties. We may enter into swaps on an
uncollateralized basis in certain circumstances. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk
remote and do not expect the settlement of these transactions to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. During the fourth quarter of 2014, certain long-lived assets met the
criteria to be classified as held for sale. At that time, the fair value of these long-lived assets was measured, resulting in expected disposal losses of $0.1 billion.
The  fair  value  of  these  assets  held  for  sale  was  measured  with  the  assistance  of  third-party  appraisals  and  other  estimates  of  fair  value,  which  used  market
approach techniques as part of the analysis. The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3, as significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation.
The expected disposal losses, which represented the difference between the fair value less cost to sell and the carrying amount of the assets held for sale, were
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Stock-Based Compensation

Verizon Communications Long-Term Incentive Plan

The Verizon Communications Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. The maximum number of shares available for awards from the Plan is 119.6 million
shares.

Restricted Stock Units

The Plan provides for grants of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. The RSUs are classified as equity
awards because the RSUs will be paid in Verizon common stock upon vesting. The RSU equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon
common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. Dividend equivalent units are also paid to participants at the time the RSU award is
paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.

Performance Stock Units

The Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the Plan, the
Human  Resources  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  determines  the  number  of  PSUs  a  participant  earns  based  on  the  extent  to  which  the  corresponding
performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs are classified as liability awards because the PSU awards are paid in
cash upon vesting. The PSU award liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of
Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. Dividend equivalent units are also paid to participants at the time that the PSU award is
determined  and  paid,  and  in  the  same  proportion  as  the  PSU  award.  The  granted  and  cancelled  activity  for  the  PSU  award  includes  adjustments  for  the
performance goals achieved.

As of December 31, 2015, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $0.3 billion and
is expected to be recognized over approximately two years.

The RSUs granted in 2015 and 2014 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $48.15 and $47.23 per unit, respectively. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we
paid $0.4 billion, $0.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.

Verizon Wireless’ Long-Term Incentive Plan

The  Verizon  Wireless  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  (the  Wireless  Plan)  provided  compensation  opportunities  to  eligible  employees  of  Verizon  Wireless  (the
Partnership). Under the Wireless Plan, Value Appreciation Rights (VARs) were granted to eligible employees. We have not granted new VARs since 2004. As of
December 31, 2015, there are no VARs that remain outstanding.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

After-tax compensation expense for stock-based compensation related to RSUs, PSUs and VARs described above included in Net income attributable to Verizon
was $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Stock Options

The Plan provides for grants of stock options to participants at an option price per share of no less than 100% of the fair market value of Verizon common stock
on  the  date  of  grant.  Each  grant  has  a  10-year  life,  vesting  equally  over  a  three-year  period,  starting  at  the  date  of  the  grant.  We  have  not  granted  new  stock
options since 2004. As of December 31, 2015, there are no stock options that remain outstanding.

Note 11

Employee Benefits

We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans for many of our employees. In addition, we maintain postretirement health care and life insurance
plans for our retirees and their dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory, and include a limit on our share of the cost for certain recent and
future retirees. In accordance with our accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include pension and benefit related
credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates and an estimated return on plan assets. These estimates are updated in
the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. The adjustment is recognized in the income statement during the fourth
quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Pension  and  other  postretirement  benefits  for  many  of  our  employees  are  subject  to  collective  bargaining  agreements.  Modifications  in  benefits  have  been
bargained from time to time, and we may also periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as
the benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

Effective January 1, 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement
benefits. Historically, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the
benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost by applying the specific
spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We have made this change to provide a
more precise measurement of interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. We will
account  for  this  change  as  a  change  in  accounting  estimate  and  accordingly  will  account  for  it  prospectively.  We  estimate  the  impact  of  this  change  on  our
consolidated  GAAP  results  for  the  first  quarter  of  2016  will  be  a  reduction  of  the  interest  cost  component  of  net  periodic  benefit  cost  and  an  increase  to  Net
income  by  approximately  $0.1  billion.  However,  at  this  time  the  estimated  impact  of  this  change  on  the  remaining  2016  interim  periods  and  for  annual  2016
results  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated  because  it  is  possible  that  in  the  future  there  may  be  changes  to  underlying  assumptions,  including  an  interim
remeasurement of our benefit obligations, which could result in different estimates. The use of the full yield curve approach does not impact how we measure our
total benefit obligations at year end or our annual net periodic benefit cost as any change in the interest cost component is completely offset by the actuarial gain
or loss measured at year end which is immediately recognized in the income statement. Accordingly, this change in estimate will not impact our income from
continuing operations, net income or earnings per share as measured on an annual basis.

In  order  to  project  the  long-term  target  investment  return  for  the  total  portfolio,  estimates  are  prepared  for  the  total  return  of  each  major  asset  class  over  the
subsequent  10-year  period.  Those  estimates  are  based  on  a  combination  of  factors  including  the  current  market  interest  rates  and  valuation  levels,  consensus
earnings expectations and historical long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset
class is then weighted according to the allocation to that investment area in the trust’s long-term asset allocation policy.

The assumed health care cost trend rates follow:

At December 31,
Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year
Rate to which cost trend rate gradually declines
Year the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter

A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

The company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets which allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk
and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that 65% of the assets have the
objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds and emerging debt) and
35% of the assets are invested as liability hedging assets (where cash flows from investments better match projected benefit payments, typically longer duration
fixed income). This allocation will shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to
ensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various
other  factors.  Due  to  our  diversification  and  risk  control  processes,  there  are  no  significant  concentrations  of  risk,  in  terms  of  sector,  industry,  geography  or
company names.

Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of Verizon common stock.

The  following  are  general  descriptions  of  asset  categories,  as  well  as  the  valuation  methodologies  and  inputs  used  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  each  major
category of assets.

Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds, primarily in diversified portfolios of investment grade money market instruments and are valued
using quoted market prices or other valuation methods, and thus are classified within Level 1 or Level 2.

Equity  securities  are  investments  in  common  stock  of  domestic  and  international  corporations  in  a  variety  of  industry  sectors,  and  are  valued  primarily  using
quoted  market  prices  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  or  other  valuation  methods  based  on  observable  inputs,  and  thus  are  classified  as  Level  1  or  Level  2.
Investments  not  traded  on  a  national  securities  exchange  use  other  valuation  methods  such  as  pricing  models  or  quoted  prices  of  securities  with  similar
characteristics depending upon market activity and availability of quoted market prices, and thus are classified as Level 3.

Fixed income securities include U.S. Treasuries and agencies, debt obligations of foreign governments and domestic and foreign corporations. Fixed income also
includes investments in collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities and interest rate swaps. The fair value of fixed income securities is based
on  observable  prices  for  identical  or  comparable  assets,  adjusted  using  benchmark  curves,  sector  grouping,  matrix  pricing,  broker/dealer  quotes  and  issuer
spreads, and thus are classified within Level 1 or Level 2.

Real  estate  investments  include  those  in  limited  partnerships  that  invest  in  various  commercial  and  residential  real  estate  projects  both  domestically  and
internationally. The fair values of real estate assets are typically determined by using income and/or cost approaches or a comparable sales approach, taking into
consideration discount and capitalization rates, financial conditions, local market conditions and the status of the capital markets, and thus are classified within
Level 3.

Commingled funds, included within the Cash and cash equivalents, Equity securities, Fixed income securities and Real estate investment asset categories, are
typically valued at net asset value (NAV) provided by the fund administrator. NAV is the redemption value of the units held at year end. As a practical expedient,
management has determined that NAV approximates fair value. These assets are categorized as Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon liquidity.

Private equity investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange. Investment
strategies in private equity include leveraged buyouts, venture capital, distressed investments and investments in natural resources. These investments are valued
using inputs such as trading multiples of comparable public securities, merger and acquisition activity and pricing data from the most recent equity financing
taking into consideration illiquidity, and thus are classified within Level 3.

Hedge  fund  investments  include  those  seeking  to  maximize  absolute  returns  using  a  broad  range  of  strategies  to  enhance  returns  and  provide  additional
diversification. The fair values of hedge funds are estimated using the NAV of the investments as a practical expedient. Investments of this type for which Verizon
has the ability to fully redeem at NAV within the near term are classified within Level 2. Investments that cannot be redeemed in the near term are classified
within Level 3.

Employer Contributions

In 2015, we contributed $0.7 billion to our qualified pension plans, $0.1 billion to our nonqualified pension plans and $0.9 billion to our other postretirement
benefit plans. We anticipate a minimum contribution of $0.6 billion to our qualified pension plans in 2016. Nonqualified pension plans contributions are estimated
to be $0.1 billion and contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be $0.9 billion in 2016.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans

We maintain four leveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions to the savings plans with
shares of our common stock from this ESOP. At December 31, 2015, the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 57 million. There were
no unallocated shares of common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2015. All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.

Total savings plan costs were $0.9 billion in 2015, $0.9 billion in 2014 and $1.0 billion in 2013.

Severance, Pension and Benefit (Credits) Charges

During 2015, we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit credits of approximately $2.3 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur. The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2014 to a weighted-average of 4.6%
at December 31, 2015 ($2.5 billion), the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015 ($1.0 billion) and a change in mortality assumptions primarily
driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2015) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.9 billion), partially offset by the difference between our estimated
return on assets of 7.25% at December 31, 2014 and our actual return on assets of 0.7% at December 31, 2015 ($1.2 billion), severance costs recorded under our
existing separation plans ($0.6 billion) and other assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion).

During 2014, we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit charges of approximately $7.5 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur. The charges were primarily driven by a decrease in
our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2013 to a weighted-average of 4.2%
at December 31, 2014 ($5.2 billion), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (RP-2014 and MP-2014) issued by
the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 ($1.8 billion) and revisions to the retirement assumptions for participants and other assumption adjustments, partially
offset  by  the  difference  between  our  estimated  return  on  assets  of  7.25%  and  our  actual  return  on  assets  of  10.5%  ($0.6  billion).  As  part  of  this  charge,  we
recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans.

During 2013, we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefit credits of approximately $6.2 billion primarily for our pension and postretirement plans in
accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur. The credits were primarily driven by an increase in
our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2012 to a weighted-average of 5.0%
at December 31, 2013 ($4.3 billion), lower than assumed retiree medical costs and other assumption adjustments ($1.4 billion) and the difference between our
estimated return on assets of 7.5% at December 31, 2012 and our actual return on assets of 8.6% at December 31, 2013 ($0.5 billion).

The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 34.9% compared to 21.7% for 2014. The increase in the effective income tax rate and provision for income taxes was
primarily due to the impact of higher income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2015 compared to severance, pension
and benefit charges recorded in 2014, as well as tax benefits associated with the utilization of certain tax credits in connection with the Omnitel Transaction in
2014.

The effective income tax rate for 2014 was 21.7% compared to 19.6% for 2013. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to additional
income taxes on the incremental income from the Wireless Transaction completed on February 21, 2014 and was partially offset by the utilization of certain tax
credits  in  connection  with  the  Omnitel  Transaction  in  2014  and  the  effective  income  tax  rate  impact  of  lower  income  before  income  taxes  due  to  severance,
pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014 compared to severance, pension and benefit credits recorded in 2013. The decrease in the provision for income
taxes was primarily due to lower income before income taxes due to severance, pension and benefit charges recorded in 2014 compared to severance, pension and
benefit credits recorded in 2013.

At December 31, 2015, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States amounted to approximately $1.8 billion.
The  majority  of  Verizon’s  cash  flow  is  generated  from  domestic  operations  and  we  are  not  dependent  on  foreign  cash  or  earnings  to  meet  our  funding
requirements, nor do we intend to repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations. Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings
represent  amounts  that  legally  must  be  kept  in  reserve  in  accordance  with  certain  foreign  jurisdictional  requirements  and  are  unavailable  for  distribution  or
repatriation. As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested
outside of the United States and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to
these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

At December 31, 2015, we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $4.1 billion that primarily relate to state and
foreign tax losses. Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $2.5 billion will expire between 2016 and 2035 and approximately $1.6
billion may be carried forward indefinitely.

During 2015, the valuation allowance increased approximately $1.6 billion primarily as a result of the acquisition of AOL. The balance of the valuation allowance
at December 31, 2015 and the 2015 activity is primarily related to state and foreign tax losses.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

would favorably affect the effective income tax rate.

We recognized the following net after-tax benefits related to interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes:

The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits was primarily due to an internal restructure that eliminated certain state unrecognized tax benefits and the expiration of
the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to the acquisition of AOL.

Verizon and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer, we are
under audit by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’s U.S. income tax
returns for tax years 2010-2012, Cellco Partnership’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2013-2014, and AOL’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2011-
2012.  Tax  controversies  are  ongoing  for  tax  years  as  early  as  2006.  The  amount  of  the  liability  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  will  change  in  the  next  twelve
months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax examinations will conclude
or require reevaluations of the Company’s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made until these tax matters
are further developed or resolved.

Note 13

Segment Information

Reportable Segments

We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and organize by products and services. We
measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment
performance.

Corporate  and  other  includes  the  operations  of  AOL  and  related  businesses,  unallocated  corporate  expenses,  the  results  of  other  businesses,  such  as  our
investments  in  unconsolidated  businesses,  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  related  costs  and  lease  financing.  Effective  January  1,  2014,  we  have  also
reclassified the results of certain businesses, such as development stage businesses that support our strategic initiatives, from our Wireline segment to Corporate
and other. The impact of this reclassification was not material to our consolidated financial statements or our segment results of operations. Corporate and other
also includes the historical results of divested operations and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due
to their non-operational nature. Although such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings.
Gains  and  losses  that  are  not  individually  significant  are  included  in  all  segment  results  as  these  items  are  included  in  the  chief  operating  decision  maker’s
assessment of segment performance.

On  July  1,  2014,  our  Wireline  segment  sold  a  non-strategic  business  (see  Note  2).  Accordingly,  the  historical  Wireline  results  for  these  operations  have  been
reclassified to Corporate and other to reflect comparable segment operating results.

The  reconciliation  of  segment  operating  revenues  and  expenses  to  consolidated  operating  revenues  and  expenses  below  also  includes  those  items  of  a  non-
operational nature. We exclude from segment results the effects of certain items that management does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily
because of their non-operational nature.

We have adjusted prior period consolidated and segment information, where applicable, to conform to current year presentation.

Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:

Segment
Wireless

Wireline

We generally account for intersegment sales of products and services and asset transfers at arm’s length prices. No single customer accounted for more than 10%
of  our  total  operating  revenues  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2015,  2014  and  2013.  International  operating  revenues  and  long-lived  assets  are  not
significant.

Note 14

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive  income  consists  of  net  income  and  other  gains  and  losses  affecting  equity  that,  under  U.S.  GAAP,  are  excluded  from  net  income.  Significant
changes in the components of Other comprehensive income, net of provision for income taxes are described below.

The  amounts  presented  above  in  net  other  comprehensive  loss  are  net  of  taxes  and  noncontrolling  interests,  which  are  not  significant.  For  the  year  ended
December 31, 2015, the amounts reclassified to net income related to defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in the table above are included in Cost of
services  and  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  on  our  consolidated  statement  of  income.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2015,  all  other  amounts
reclassified to net income in the table above are included in Other income and (expense), net on our consolidated statement of income.

Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments

The change in Foreign currency translation adjustments during 2015 was related to our non-U.S. dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The change in
Foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  during  2014  was  primarily  a  result  of  the  completion  of  the  Omnitel  transaction.  The  change  in  Foreign  currency
translation adjustments during 2013 was primarily related to our investment in Vodafone Omnitel N.V. which was driven by the movements of the U.S. dollar
against the Euro.

Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges

During  2014  and  2013,  Unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  cash  flow  hedges  included  in  Other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests
primarily reflect activity related to cross currency swaps. Reclassification adjustments on cash flow hedges primarily reflect the reclassification to Other income
and (expense), net of a portion of the unrealized gains and losses on cross currency swaps to offset related pre-tax foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the
underlying debt obligations (see Note 9).

Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Marketable Securities

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, reclassification adjustments on marketable securities for gains (losses) realized in net income were not significant.

Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans

The change in Defined benefit pension and postretirement plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was not significant.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, Verizon repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock under our authorized share
buyback program for approximately $0.1 billion. At December 31, 2015, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon
under our share buyback program was 97.2 million.

In addition to the previously authorized three-year share buyback program, in February 2015, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized Verizon to enter into an
accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement to repurchase $5.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. On February 10, 2015, in exchange for an up-front
payment totaling $5.0 billion, Verizon received an initial delivery of 86.2 million shares having a value of approximately $4.25 billion. On June 5, 2015, Verizon
received an additional 15.4 million shares as final settlement of the transaction under the ASR agreement. In total, 101.6 million shares were delivered under the
ASR at an average repurchase price of $49.21.

Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareowner plans, including 22.6 million common
shares issued from Treasury stock during the year ended December 31, 2015, which had an aggregate value of $0.9 billion.

Note 16

Commitments and Contingencies

In  the  ordinary  course  of  business  Verizon  is  involved  in  various  commercial  litigation  and  regulatory  proceedings  at  the  state  and  federal  level.  Where  it  is
determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter, the Company establishes
an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the
amounts  already  accrued  cannot  be  made  at  this  time  due  to  various  factors  typical  in  contested  proceedings,  including  (1)  uncertain  damage  theories  and
demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; (3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable
nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do
not expect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods, including the Hicksville matter described below, will have a
material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.

Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include
funds  to  address  contamination  at  the  site  of  a  former  Sylvania  facility  in  Hicksville  NY,  which  had  processed  nuclear  fuel  rods  in  the  1950s  and  1960s.  In
September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken
primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to
the past and future expenses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites
requiring remediation.

Verizon is currently involved in approximately 60 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents. Most of these cases are brought
by non-practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and seek injunctive
relief as well. These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.

In  connection  with  the  execution  of  agreements  for  the  sales  of  businesses  and  investments,  Verizon  ordinarily  provides  representations  and  warranties  to  the
purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From
time  to  time,  counterparties  may  make  claims  under  these  provisions,  and  Verizon  will  seek  to  defend  against  those  claims  and  resolve  them  in  the  ordinary
course of business.

Subsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was issued when the
directory  business  was  purchased  in  2001  and  had  a  30-year  term  (before  extensions).  The  preexisting  guarantee  continues,  without  modification,  despite  the
subsequent  sale  of  Verizon  Information  Services  Canada  and  the  spin-off  of  our  domestic  print  and  Internet  yellow  pages  directories  business.  The  possible
financial impact of the guarantee, which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the
guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may offset each other. We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely.

As  of  December  31,  2015,  letters  of  credit  totaling  approximately  $0.1  billion,  which  were  executed  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  support  several
financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.

We have several commitments primarily to purchase programming and network services, equipment, software, handsets and peripherals, and marketing activities,
which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business, from a variety of suppliers totaling $21.9 billion. Of this total amount, $8.4 billion is attributable to
2016, $9.2 billion is attributable to 2017 through 2018, $2.3 billion is attributable to 2019 through 2020 and $2.0 billion is attributable to years thereafter. These
amounts  do  not  represent  our  entire  anticipated  purchases  in  the  future,  but  represent  only  those  items  that  are  the  subject  of  contractual  obligations.  Our
commitments  are  generally  determined  based  on  the  noncancelable  quantities  or  termination  amounts.  Purchases  against  our  commitments  for  2015  totaled
approximately  $10.2  billion.  Since  the  commitments  to  purchase  programming  services  from  television  networks  and  broadcast  stations  have  no  minimum
volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2015, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect
at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.

EXHIBIT 31.1

I, Lowell C. McAdam, certify that:

1.

2.

3.

4.

I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Verizon Communications Inc.;

Based  on  my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue  statement  of  a  material  fact  or  omit  to  state  a  material  fact  necessary  to  make  the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e))  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f))  for  the
registrant and have:

(a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
that  material  information  relating  to  the  registrant,  including  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  is  made  known  to  us  by  others  within  those  entities,
particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

(b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

(c)

Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

(d) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal

quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and

5.

The  registrant’s  other  certifying  officer  and  I  have  disclosed,  based  on  our  most  recent  evaluation  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  to  the

I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Verizon Communications Inc.;

Based  on  my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue  statement  of  a  material  fact  or  omit  to  state  a  material  fact  necessary  to  make  the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e))  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f))  for  the
registrant and have:

(a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
that  material  information  relating  to  the  registrant,  including  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  is  made  known  to  us  by  others  within  those  entities,
particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

(b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

(c)

Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

(d) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal

quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and

5.

The  registrant’s  other  certifying  officer  and  I  have  disclosed,  based  on  our  most  recent  evaluation  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  to  the
registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

(a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely

to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

(b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over

financial reporting.
