“The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter of strong performance, with sales, gross
profit, and SG&A expenses all better than our internal expectations. During the quarter, we
drove growth across all major categories, increased the number of loyalty members, and
strengthened engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand. In addition, our teams achieved
important milestones for our multi-year, transformational investment agenda designed to
drive efficiencies and support our future growth,” said Dave Kimbell, chief executive officer.
“The beauty category has continued to deliver healthy growth, as consumers maintain their
post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty. Our proven business model,
diverse assortment, best-in-class loyalty program, and outstanding teams have enabled us
to deliver stronger-than expected results for the first half of fiscal 2023, and I remain
confident we can deliver against our updated expectations for the rest of the year.”

For the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2023

Net sales increased 10.1% to $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion in the second
quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to increased comparable sales, strong new store
performance, and growth in other revenue.

Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales)
increased 8.0% compared to an increase of 14.4% in the second quarter of fiscal
2022, driven by a 9.0% increase in transactions and a 1.0% decrease in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 7.1% to $993.6 million compared to $928.2 million in the second
quarter of fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 39.3%
compared to 40.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower
merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink, and higher supply chain costs, partially
offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 12.4% to $600.7
million compared to $534.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. As a
percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 23.7% compared to 23.3% in
the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher corporate overhead due to
strategic investments, higher store payroll and benefits, and higher store expenses,
partially offset by leverage of incentive compensation.
Operating income increased to $391.6 million, or 15.5% of net sales, compared to
$391.4 million, or 17.0% of net sales.
Net interest income increased to $4.4 million compared to $0.1 million in the second
quarter of fiscal 2022, due to higher average interest rates on cash balances.
The tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.5% in the second quarter of fiscal
2022.
Net income increased to $300.1 million compared to $295.7 million.
Diluted earnings per share increased 5.6% to $6.02 compared to $5.70, including a
$0.01 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.

For the First Six Months of Fiscal 2023

Net sales increased 11.2% to $5.2 billion compared to $4.6 billion in the first six
months of fiscal 2022, primarily due to increased comparable sales, strong new store
performance, and growth in other revenue.
Comparable sales increased 8.7% compared to an increase of 16.2% in the first six
months of fiscal 2022, driven by a 10.1% increase in transactions and a 1.4% decrease
in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 9.6% to $2.0 billion compared to $1.9 billion in the first six
months of fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 39.7%
compared to 40.3% in the first six months of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher
inventory shrink, lower merchandise margin, and higher supply chain costs, partially
offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs.
SG&A expenses increased 17.1% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the first six
months of fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to
23.5% compared to 22.3% in the first six months of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher
corporate overhead due to strategic investments, higher store payroll and benefits, and
higher marketing expenses, partially offset by leverage of incentive compensation.
Net interest income increased to $11.8 million compared to net interest expense of
$0.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022, due to higher average interest rates
on cash balances.
Operating income increased to $833.7 million, or 16.1% of net sales, compared to
$829.1 million, or 17.9% of net sales.
The tax rate decreased to 23.5% compared to 24.3%.
Net income increased to $647.2 million compared to $627.1 million.

Diluted earnings per share increased 7.5% to $12.90, including a $0.14 benefit due to
income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $12.00, including a
$0.03 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.

Balance Sheet

Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $388.6
million.

Merchandise inventories, net at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 9.0%
to $1.82 billion compared to $1.67 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The
increase was primarily due to inventory to support higher sales demand, 37 net new stores,
product cost increases, and new brand launches.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 593,629 shares of its
common stock at a cost of $275.5 million. During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the
