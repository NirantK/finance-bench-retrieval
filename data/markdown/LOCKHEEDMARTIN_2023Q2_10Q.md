BETHESDA, Md., July 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin Corporation [NYSE: LMT] today reported second quarter 2023 net

Cash Flows and Capital Deployment Activities

Cash from operations in the second quarter of 2023 was $1.1 billion and capital expenditures were $329 million, resulting in free cash
flow of $771 million. The decrease in operating and free cash flows in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022
was primarily due to the timing of federal tax payments.

The company's cash activities in the second quarter of 2023, included the following:

paying cash dividends of $758 million;
paying $750 million to repurchase 1.6 million shares (including 0.1 million shares received upon settlement of an accelerated
share repurchase agreement (ASR) in the third quarter 2023; and
receiving net proceeds of $1,975 million from a debt issuance of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.45% Notes due May 15, 2028, $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Notes due February 15,
2034, and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% Notes due February 15, 2055.

Segment Results

The company operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of products and services offered: Aeronautics,
Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. The following table presents summary operating

1 Effective Jan. 1, 2023, the company reclassified intangible asset amortization expense out of the business segment operating profit and into the unallocated items

line item to better align with how management views and manages the business. The 2022 amounts reflect the impact of this change.

Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are
eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating
profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees
are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.

Business segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment, a portion of corporate costs not considered
allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or
federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating
performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, stock-based
compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures,
intangible asset amortization expense, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in the reconciling item
"Unallocated items" between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.

Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or
decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts.
Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition,
comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by
changes in profit booking rates on the company's contracts. Increases in profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit
adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions
on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total
costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit
adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect
of such changes.

The company's consolidated net favorable profit booking rate adjustments represented approximately 20% and 26% of total segment
operating profit in the quarters ended June 25, 2023 and June 26, 2022.

Aeronautics' net sales in the second quarter of 2023 increased $1.0 billion, or 17%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase
was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $735 million for the F-35 program due to higher volume on production contracts partially
driven by lower volume in the second quarter of 2022 due to the impact of the delays in receiving additional contractual authorization
and funding under the Lots 15-17 contract and higher volume on sustainment contracts; higher net sales of $100 million on classified
programs due to higher volume; and higher net sales of $90 million for the C-130 program due to higher volume on sustainment
contracts.

Aeronautics' operating profit in the second quarter of 2023 increased $105 million, or 17%, compared to the same period in 2022. The
increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of $75 million for the F-35 program due to higher volume on production
contracts; and higher operating profit of $20 million on classified programs due to lower unfavorable profit adjustments. Total net profit
booking rate adjustments in the second quarter of 2023 were comparable to the same period in 2022.

and strike missile programs due to higher volume (Precision Strike Missile (PrSM)) was offset by lower net sales of $20 million for
integrated air and missile defense programs due to lower volume (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)).

MFC's operating profit in the second quarter of 2023 decreased $47 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2022. The
decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of $25 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to lower net
favorable profit adjustments (Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER®) and Infrared Search and Track (IRST21®)); and lower
operating profit of $20 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (High Mobility Artillery
Rocket System (HIMARS) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM)). Total net profit booking rate adjustments were $55 million

RMS' net sales in the second quarter of 2023 decreased $115 million, or 3%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was
primarily attributable to lower net sales of $145 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume (Black Hawk).
This decrease was partially offset by higher net sales of $60 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to
higher volume (Aegis, Defense of Guam, and TPY-4 programs).

RMS' operating profit in the second quarter of 2023 decreased $7 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease
was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of $60 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to an unfavorable profit adjustment

of $100 million on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (CMHP) as a result of increased costs and lower than planned revenues
and lower production volume (Black Hawk), partially offset by higher equity earnings and higher net favorable profit adjustments
(Seahawk). This decrease was partially offset by higher operating profit of $75 million for IWSS programs primarily due to a favorable
profit adjustment of $65 million as a result of a positive resolution of a contractual matter on an international surveillance and control
program. Additionally, the decreases in net profit booking rate adjustments and volume as described above were partially offset by
contract mix. Total net profit booking rate adjustments were $40 million lower in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same
period in 2022.

Space's net sales in the second quarter of 2023 increased $341 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase
was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $150 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher development
volume (Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)); higher net sales of $120 million for national security space programs due to higher
development volume (classified and Transport Layer programs); and higher net sales of $65 million for commercial civil space programs
due to higher volume (Orion).

Space's operating profit in the second quarter of 2023 increased $41 million, or 15%, compared to the same period in 2022. The
increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of $25 million for commercial civil space programs due to higher net
favorable profit adjustments and higher volume (Orion); and higher operating profit of $15 million for higher equity earnings from the
company's investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA) due to launch mix. Total net profit booking rate adjustments in the second
quarter of 2023 were comparable to the same period in 2022.

Total equity earnings (primarily ULA) represented approximately $20 million, or 6%, of Space's operating profit in the second quarter of
2023, compared to approximately $5 million, or 2%, in the second quarter of 2022.

Income Taxes

The company's effective income tax rate was 16.2% and 6.4% for the quarters ended June 25, 2023 and June 26, 2022. The rate for the
second quarter of 2022 was lower than the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes resulting from a
noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion, which reduced the tax expense by approximately $314 million. The
rates for all periods benefited from research and development tax credits, tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, and
dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature.

1 Reflects the amount by which expected total CAS pension cost of $1.7 billion, exceeds the expected FAS pension service cost and excludes expected non-service
FAS pension income. Refer to the supplemental table "Selected Financial Data" included in this news release for a detail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.

Free cash flow

Free cash flow is cash from operations less capital expenditures. The company's capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and
facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are
capitalized). The company uses free cash flow to evaluate its business performance and overall liquidity and it is a performance goal in
the company's annual and long-term incentive plans. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it
represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to
stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions or other
investments. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not
account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt and pension contributions.

Adjusted earnings before income taxes; adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS

Earnings before income taxes, net earnings and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were impacted by certain non-operational items for all
periods. Management believes the presentation of these measures adjusted for the impacts of these non-operational items is useful to
investors in understanding the company's underlying business performance and comparing performance from period to period. The tax
effects related to each adjustment that impacted earnings before income taxes are based on a blended tax rate that combines the
federal statutory rate of 21% plus an estimated state tax rate.

Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment – adjusted; Total FAS pension income - adjusted

Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment and Total FAS pension income have been adjusted for the noncash, non-operating pension
settlement charge recorded in the second quarter 2022. Management believes that the exclusion of the pension settlement charge is
useful to understanding the company's underlying business performance and comparing performance from period to period.

periods.
